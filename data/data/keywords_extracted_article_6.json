        "title": "How Savanah Leaf Went from Olympic Athlete to Astonishing New Filmmaker to Watch",
        "content": "When Savanah Leaf turns 30 in November this year, she will have already notched a number of professional titles few people could dream of possessing, including both “lauded filmmaker” and “Olympic athlete.”While those two pursuits may sound different, for the British-born Leaf, who makes her feature directorial debut with the enthusiastically received A24 drama “Earth Mama” a decade after playing volleyball for Great Britain at the 2012 London Olympics, they’re really not so far apart.Leaf’s first feature, which IndieWire’s Ryan Lattanzio hailed out of Sundance as a “sublime” drama that “defies all cliches,” follows Gia, a young Black mother whose son and daughter from an all-but-nonexistent father are in foster-care limbo while she recovers from drug addiction. As Gia (played by first-time actress Tia Nomore in a stunning performance) makes her way through the various requirements of reunification while also being heavily pregnant with her third child and struggling to make ends meet, Leaf unspools a shimmering (and occasionally surreal) tale of a mother’s love.Like many budding filmmakers, Leaf grew up watching plenty of animated films — her mother, Alison Leaf, is an animator and set dresser who has worked on several Pixar films, including “WALL-E,” “Up,” “Turning Red,” and the last two “Toy Story” features — and Leaf still fondly remembers watching “Babe: Pig in the City” as a kid. (It was one of her mom’s very first credits, a “big one for her.”) While she said she didn’t get too into auteur-driven films until she was making her own, even as a teenager, Leaf had good taste: she was “obsessed” with Gina Prince-Bythewood’s “Love & Basketball.” Given Leaf’s artistic chops and athletic prowess, that affection seems like an obvious slam dunk.Though Leaf was always an artistically minded kid, once she got to middle school, most of her extracurricular time was spent playing sports like volleyball and basketball. “When I got to high school, it was like, OK, I’m going to be able to go to college for one of these sports, and I knew I was better at volleyball, so I verbally committed to go play in college my sophomore year of high school,” Leaf said during a recent interview with IndieWire in Manhattan. “I couldn’t have paid to go to university any other way. This was giving me a full ride. So that kind of took over everything.”Leaf started her college career at San Jose State before transferring to the University of Miami for her sophomore year (Leaf closed out her collegiate career in high style, graduating as the 2014 Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year). She’d hoped for a “more art-leaning major” in college (she was already interested in everything from photography to painting before she left home), but her volleyball obligations kept her far too busy. Eventually, she decided to major in psychology, which ended up — funnily enough — suiting her artistic ambitions. “I feel like that’s really related to film,” Leaf said. “Film feels like a combination of psychology, working in a team environment, and artistic expression. For me, the transition didn’t feel as wild as maybe it seems on paper.”After she graduated from Miami, Leaf played professional volleyball in Turkey and Puerto Rico before an injury led her to take a year off. That time away from the grind of professional sports reignited her creative fire.“I was taking lots of photographs, I was really interested in art, but I was trying to figure out how I could do that,” she said. “I got injured playing volleyball, and I just kind of dove into working at a music video and commercial production company. I was basically asking different people, different companies, whether or not they would hire me. I had nothing on my resume. One company hired me, and it enabled me to see directors and how they pitch and how they write and what references they’re pulling, really up close. That inspired me to think that I could do it as well.”As Leaf started to feel out her filmmaking aspirations, she directed short films (including “F Word,” which deals with child abandonment, and “The 4th Wave,” about Italian rapper Alessandra Prete, aka Priestess) and music videos for everyone from Gary Clark, Jr. to Common. She was also beginning to formulate what would become “Earth Mama,” as influenced by another major life event that happened when she was just 16: the adoption of her little sister.“It was just me and my mom throughout all my upbringing, and she really wanted me to have a sister,” Leaf said. “When I wrote the first draft of the film, I was thinking about my relationship to my sister, and I was thinking about her birth mother, and what she was going through at the time. I kind of imagined myself in her shoes, and how I would handle the systems in place.”Leaf’s initial script eventually led her to make the documentary short “The Heart Still Hums” as a kind of “emotional research.” The women she and co-filmmaker Taylor Russell interviewed for the documentary, which follows five mothers fighting to regain custody of their children, “gave texture to the script and it grounded it in a different way. The film started from a very personal place, but then expanded into a sort of collective voice,” she said.Leaf is very cognizant of the fact that “Earth Mama” is not exactly her story, and Gia is not exactly her (or her sister, or even her sister’s birth mother), and the intense care and empathy she applied to making the film shine through in every luminous frame. (She also spent significant time interviewing women, speaking to experts, and poring over literature on the subjects the film touches.)“I haven’t been through this specific situation, but I think a lot about how I handle stress and obstacles,” the filmmaker said. “I try to think of Gia as me and how would I handle this situation, how would I handle seeing my children for a couple of hours a week, and that’s your window of opportunity to connect with them. It might not be my specific story, but I think the way in which we handle it is about not thinking anybody is other, everybody is us. It could be me.”Casting first-time actress Nomore, best known as a popular Bay Area rapper, in the film’s lead role “took a few moments,” Leaf said. “The first time she read the scenes with our casting directors, she was very present. She was looking and responding and listening very honestly. That really stood out, because I think a lot of people, when they’re acting for the first time, they try to put on a show. She wasn’t really doing that. I was nervous, because when you’re rapping, you’re putting on a show, but she has to pull away from that. When I saw her and she was willing to go there and be vulnerable, that was really exciting.”Their next meeting? Leaf carefully termed it “not necessarily great.” Nomore came to see the “Earth Mama” team after a rap performance, “and she came straight from it and was all done up, and it was hard for me to really see her then,” Leaf said. And the meeting after that? “She took all that makeup off and she just became more grounded again. That was really the moment, because I could see her, yes, she might have this other side to her, but she’s willing to pull it all away.”Nomore was also willing to go deep and to get extremely personal, even down to the ways in which her own body reflected Gia’s journey. “She had just had a child a year prior, and she was still breastfeeding,” Leaf said. “Her body, physically, was very much in touch with how it felt to carry a baby and how it felt to go into labor. She was training to be a doula, so she was hearing a lot of other people’s stories at the time, and I think that made her very sensitive to the story.”Leaf kept Nomore even more present during filming by not showing her star the entire script. “She saw like 70 percent of it, and we had discussions on that, how she felt about it, and she really didn’t want to see the full script,” Leaf said. “She was eager to stay as present as possible. I think that helped, just thinking about it from scene to scene, thinking about how would I handle this moment, how would I handle this moment? The character is quiet and holding a lot in until the end, and it’s not that she’s not angry, but it’s just bubbling.”Leaf’s younger sister, who is just 14, has seen the film and “really loved” it. (She even appears in a handful of scenes as a background extra.) “At that age, I don’t know how much you’re thinking about the full depth of the film,” Leaf said. “But to me, it’s kind of an ode to mothers and what they have to go through, and recognizing that it’s not as simple as it’s told to you or as we initially think it to be. Hopefully, as she grows, she’ll look at it in different ways and feel like it commemorates her in a respectful and authentic way.”And their mother? “She really loves it,” Leaf said. “I was very nervous to share it with both of them, and my mom never read the script or anything, because I didn’t want to adjust it for anybody, I wanted it to feel honest. And then when she watched it, I think she was really surprised and happy to receive it.”Up next, Leaf has plenty of balls in play: the Hauser & Wirth Gallery in downtown Los Angeles is currently hosting an exhibition titled “American Gurl” that “showcases video art, film, and performance to unpack and re-envision the American Dream through the lens of women.” Leaf’s nine-minute “self-portrait” entitled “run” is part of the program, which goes through the end of the month.And, yes, she also wants to make another feature, and she hints that one is already percolating in her brain. “I have an idea about a project that I’m really excited about, and so I’m kind of currently diving into that,” Leaf said. A sports metaphor, naturally.A24 releases “Earth Mama” in theaters on Friday, July 7.",

        "content": "From the films of Krzysztof Kieślowski to Claire Denis, Oscar winner Juliette Binoche has starred in many of your favorite European arthouse classics, and she’s probably the reason we return to them again and again. This summer, New Yorkers — or any ambitious traveling cinephiles — will have the chance to see many of her all-time greatest performances on 35mm thanks to a new retrospective set for the Quad Cinema in Greenwich Village.IndieWire exclusively announces “Beautiful Binoche,” which will take place August 4–10 at New York City’s longest-running, four-screen multiplex. In addition to some of the great Binoche titles from the ’80s, ’90s, and 2000s, the Quad Cinema will also present Binoche’s latest film, “Between Two Worlds,” opening from Cohen Media Group on August 11.The French actress has long made a career playing determined women pulling themselves through confusing situations — from perverse erotic entanglements to political intrigue and isolating grief. The Quad’s “Beautiful Binoche” program features 35mm prints of the psychosexual classic “Damage” (Louis Malle, 1992; see this twisted May-December thriller if you haven’t), which was recently highlighted in Karina Longworth’s podcast series “You Must Remember This”; chilling Cannes Best Director winner “Caché” (Michael Haneke, 2005); and the postmodern Tuscan art rumination “Certified Copy” (Abbas Kiarostami, 2010), which won Binoche her first and only Best Actress prize at Cannes. (She won her Oscar in 1997 for “The English Patient,” beating out Lauren Bacall and even effusively, charmingly apologizing onstage for doing so.)Also screening on digital formats will be the film that put her on the international map, the Milan Kundera erotic epic “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” (Philip Kaufman, 1988), plus one of the best films of the 1990s, “Three Colors: Blue” (Krzysztof Kieslowski, 1993), along with “Clouds of Sils Maria” (Olivier Assayas, 2014) and “Let the Sunshine In” (Claire Denis, 2017), her first collaboration with Denis, who directed Binoche last year in “Both Sides of the Blade.”“If showing a retrospective has to do with seeing an evolution, I can imagine the difficulty of choosing 10 films out of 100,” Binoche said in a statement shared with IndieWire. “Acting in a film has been for me an exploration of my present, life and being, confronting the story of a film and the people I was working with. I mostly had admiration with the artists I had the privilege to work with and often took the chance of a new take as a chance to be closer to the art. Nothing else interests me more than truth, depth and being present. The need of sharing is what gives me purpose. Acting is the best way to be next to people, in their heart, mind and cells.”See the full program here.",

        "content": "If only the British royals and America’s first family became one. Such is the premise of the film adaptation of Casey McQuiston’s bestselling novel “Red, White & Royal Blue.”The R-rated queer rom-com stars Taylor Zakhar Perez as Alex, the president’s son, who can’t stand Britain’s Prince Henry (Nicholas Galitzine). Their long-running feud threatens to drive a wedge in U.S./British relations, but after being forced to stage a truce, sparks fly. Add in Uma Thurman as the President of the United States, and Prime Video’s “Red, White & Royal Blue” has the makings of a campy summer blockbuster.Per the official synopsis, Alex Claremont-Diaz ((Perez), the son of the President of the United States (Uma Thurman), and Britain’s Prince Henry (Galitzine) have a lot in common: Stunning good looks, undeniable charisma, international popularity…and a total disdain for each other. Separated by an ocean, their long-running feud hasn’t really been an issue, until a disastrous — and very public — altercation at a royal event becomes tabloid fodder, driving a potential wedge in U.S./British relations at the worst possible time. As Alex and Henry’s icy relationship unexpectedly begins to thaw into a tentative friendship, the friction that existed between them sparks something deeper than they ever expected.The cast is rounded out by Clifton Collins Jr., Sarah Shahi, Rachel Hilson, Stephen Fry, Ellie Bamber, Thomas Flynn, Malcolm Atobrah, Akshay Khanna, Sharon D Clarke, Aneesh Sheth, and Juan Castano.Tony Award-winning playwright Matthew López (“The Inheritance”) makes his feature directing debut with the film, which he co-wrote alongside Ted Malawer. “Red, White, and Royal Blue” is produced by Greg Berlanti and Sarah Schechter, with author McQuiston and writer-director López executive producing.Michael Riley McGrath and Michael S.

        "title": "Lily Gladstone: Scorsese’s ‘Killers of the Flower Moon’ Is More ‘Great American Tragedy’ Than ‘Western’",
        "content": "“Killers of the Flower Moon” star Lily Gladstone says Martin Scorsese‘s film is more complicated than your traditional Western, where Indigenous characters have historically suffered stereotyping.The Blackfeet/Niimíipuu actress, who portrays Osage woman Mollie Burkhart in the period piece film, told Empire magazine, “A lot of people are really wanting to call this ‘Martin Scorsese’s Western.’ With natives and Westerns, we are so dehumanized that it just kind of feels like we’re part of the landscape – instead of humans that are telling a story.”She added that the film is instead “a great American tragedy.” Gladstone’s character is wed to suspicious cattle rancher Ernest (Leonardo DiCaprio), whose uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro) is determined to gain control over the oil under their feet in Oklahoma.“Having grown up on my reservation in Montana, in the American West and Indian country, it was very familiar to see this goofy, exaggerated cowboy sort of a character falling for a really self-possessed native woman,” Gladstone said of the dynamic with DiCaprio’s character. “That’s just such a familiar dynamic. And that was backed up by a lot of community stories that we had heard.”“Killers of the Flower Moon” debuted at 2023 Cannes and co-stars Jesse Plemons, John Lithgow, and Brendan Fraser. The film is based on David Grann’s nonfiction book about the series of murders in Osage County, Oklahoma, during the 1920s after oil was discovered on Osage Nation Indigenous land. The newly formed FBI investigated the cases at the time.“Killers of the Flower Moon” will be premiering in IMAX with a limited release on Friday, October 6, before opening wide on Friday, October 20. Apple Original Films has not yet set a streaming premiere.For all the details on “Killers of the Flower Moon,” click here.",

        "title": "‘Amanda’ Review: Gen Z Ennui Gets the New Deadpan Heroine It Deserves",
        "content": "Amanda hasn’t done a lot of living in her 24 years. She’s never had a job, a boyfriend, or even a friend. She doesn’t fit in with her family — all of them pharmacists — even though she loves the clan’s longtime housekeeper and she’s got a real bond with her too-serious young niece. She’s got a shitty apartment of her own, but it’s outfitted with fancy furniture she seems to have pilfered from the family home a few blocks down the street. She goes to secret raves to pass the time, stands outside the local cinema in hopes of catching a glimpse of someone who might make for a reasonable pal, and has begun harboring a desire to free a horse from a local farm. She’s addicted to her phone, which speaks to her in stilted Siri-ese and is programmed to only call her “Sexy Mama.” Who else would?She’s rude, sad, silly, and very lonely, and she’s exactly the kind of heroine Gen Z doesn’t just need but deserves. She is, after all, the kind of person an entire film is named after.In Carolina Cavalli’s painfully funny “Amanda,” the very watchable Benedetta Porcaroli stars as the titular young woman (does Amanda know “Lady Bird”? we bet she does) as she embarks on something of a search for self, punctuated by the deadpan, the absurd, and the disaffected. The trick: Even with all that ironic distance, we can’t help but root for her.The part about Amanda never having a friend? That’s only partially true. When the film opens, we briefly meet young Amanda as she blithely floats in her family’s fancy swimming pool (the pharmacological arts really pay) while her only friend Rebecca zones out on a nearby chaise lounge. But while this scene might initially scan as a hazy little slice of childhood, Amanda can’t help but ruin it, tossing herself into the pool and (maybe?) nearly drowning in the process, at least until her dedicated domestic worker saves her. More than a decade later, and Rebecca is long gone, the entire family can’t get over Amanda’s gall at (possibly?) almost dying, and the family’s maid Judy (Ana Cecilia Ponce) remains her only pal.Amanda knows she’s weird, but she’s not so interested in changing that (former model Porcaroli is gorgeous, but she’s also credibly off-putting when tapping into all of Amanda’s numerous affectations). Having a friend, though? That might be nice. When Judy lets slip that Rebecca was once targeted as her BFF (the girls’ own mothers are best friends, with some serious distance between them), Amanda sets out on a quest to right what she believes is her life’s most grievous wrong: make Rebecca her friend, for real.But if we think Amanda is strange (she wears the same outfit each day, including culottes and a crocheted vest, her idea of spicing things up is to add a fancy brooch, leading to one of the film’s best sight gags, of which there are many), shut-in Rebecca (Galatéa Bellugi) is an even tougher nut to crack. Yet, Amanda won’t be deterred, even as the rest of her life starts careening into other interesting corners, including a possible boyfriend, a potential job, and a growing closeness with the other people who populate her rarefied existence.Cavalli’s Italian-language feature (with English subtitles) previously screened at both Venice and TIFF, which should give some insight into its level of craftsmanship and voice (read: high!). Cavalli, who also wrote the film’s screenplay, is clearly pulling from a variety of inspirations — Wes Anderson, Sofia Coppola, Yorgos Lanthimos, Noah Baumbach, and Paolo Sorrentino all spring to mind — when it comes to her deadpan, highly mannered debut. But thanks to both Cavalli’s clear affection for her lead character and Porcaroli’s winning performance, there’s a certain sweetness to “Amanda” that also appeals.Even as Amanda seeks out companionship in the weirdest of spaces — like logging on to a series of video chat rooms clearly made for sex stuff, where she runs into a dude who wants to talk dirty to her through the use of a can of spices — her desire to be part of the world charms. Amanda may be socially awkward (often plain old horrible to be around) and prone to bizarre demands, but she’s also just a person trying to make her way during a period of existence in which disconnection is everyone’s standard setting.She’s the kind of girl who will sit outside your bedroom for days on end until you’re willing to talk, the kind of girl who dreams of earning enough loyalty points at the local grocery store to trade them in for a fancy fan, the kind of girl who will free a lonely horse just because she thinks that’s what he wants. In a world where everyone feels lonely, Amanda might be our most authentic avatar, someone willing to get super weird in the hopes it will lead somewhere great. For Cavalli and “Amanda,” the results speak for themselves: The film, and its titular heroine, are great indeed.Oscilloscope will release “Amanda” in select NY and LA theaters on Friday, July 7.",

        "title": "32 Movies Quentin Tarantino Doesn’t Like, from ‘Atomic Blonde’ and ‘1917’ to ‘Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade’",
        "content": "Love him or hate him, what Quentin Tarantino has achieved over his more than 30 years of filmmaking is inarguably impressive. Not only is the “Reservoir Dogs” writer/director a renowned auteur — nominated three times for the Best Director Oscar with two Best Original Screenplay wins for “Pulp Fiction” and “Django Unchained” — Tarantino is also a well-versed film critic whose encyclopedic knowledge of other artists’ filmographies precedes him.Living in Los Angeles, the “Pulp Fiction” director famously began his journey to cinematic rock star status as an employee at the Video Archives rental store in Manhattan Beach: since closed, rebuilt in Tarantino’s basement, and turned into a podcast he hosts with longtime friend and collaborator Roger Avary. It was in the bygone era of rewindable tapes that Tarantino cut his critical teeth: combing through the store’s collection, full of everything from black-and-white classics to straight-to-TV sci-fi specials.A famed borrower (or appropriator, depending on your viewpoint), Tarantino pulls liberally from the movies he likes to inspire his work; see the Blaxploitation tropes in “Jackie Brown” and the samurai films channeled in the “Kill Bill” duology. The writer/director’s favorites are well-documented for this reason. IndieWire previously rounded up dozens of the filmmaker’s go-to recommendations, from John Carpenter’s “The Thing” to Brian De Palma’s “Blowout.”Though he’s shared fewer of them, the movies Tarantino doesn’t like have also piqued audience interest. Over the years, the cinephile has lambasted a wide array of esteemed competing directors, including John Ford (Tarantino dubbed his westerns “overrated”) and Stanley Kubrick (whom Tarantino has said is a “hypocrite” for his stance on depicting violence). Last summer on his podcast, Tarantino even called Ed Wood and François Truffaut “bumbling amateurs,” which, you know, fair maybe.Tarantino tends to speak about film history and trends in general terms, so it’s less common for him to name specific titles he didn’t enjoy. But when he does, the “Cinema Speculation” author really lets it fly.Compiled from interviews and news stories throughout Tarantino’s career, the following list contains 32 films (well, 30 films and two TV shows) the writer/director reportedly does not recommend: be it because he considers the films themselves to be bad or because the circumstances surrounding their releases left Tarantino feeling sour.Featuring a notable number of sequels — and a couple of fringe cases Tarantino didn’t wholesale dismiss, but only liked parts of — the following selections are listed in no particular order. They range from Sam Mendes’ Academy Award winner “1917” to action blockbusters like the Charlize Theron-starring “Atomic Blonde” to classic comedies such as Ivan Reitman’s “Stripes” and the Alfred Hitchcock flick “Frenzy.”[Editor’s note: This article was first published in December 2022 and has been updated multiple times since.]Rather than heap more praise on “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,” Tarantino spends the Tobe Hooper section of “Cinema Speculation” reevaluating the filmmaker’s other works. Tarantino compliments “Eaten Alive” for its sleazy fun, and praises screenwriter Larry Block for his surprisingly sophisticated work on “The Funhouse.” But Tarantino notes his distate for Hooper’s serialized adaptation of Stephen King’s “Salem’s Lot,” having tried the show twice with no success.“When I finally saw it, I was prepared for something great. And man was I disappointed,” Tarantino said. “To me, it just seemed like a stretched-out TV movie done in a very TV style (and I like TV movies)…I tried to watch it again a couple of years ago and it was just too dull. I turned it off after about twenty-five minutes.”Most people generally rate “Last Crusade” as the second-best “Indiana Jones” film, after the original “Raiders of the Lost Ark.” But Tarantino believes the film, which sees Harrison Ford’s adventuring hero team up with his father (played by Sean Connery), is the weakest in the beloved film series. “I like ‘Crystal Skull’ more than the Sean Connery one,” he said in an interview on the podcast ReelBlend. “I don’t like the Sean Connery one at all. … That’s such a boring one. It’s boring. And he’s not an interesting character.”  Not only has Tarantino not seen “Red Notice” or “The Adam Project,” he doesn’t seem to know either film’s titles. But that didn’t stop him from citing the two Netflix movies, which both star Ryan Reynolds, as examples of how streaming has ruined film and has primed him to retire from the industry. Specifically, Tarantino said the two action films “don’t even exist” in the zeitgeist. “I mean, and I’m not picking on anybody, but apparently for Netflix, Ryan Reynolds has made $50 million on this movie and $50 million on that movie and $50 million on the next movie for them,” the director said in an interview with Deadline. “I don’t know what any of those movies are. I’ve never seen them. Have you? I haven’t ever talked to Ryan Reynolds’ agent, but his agent is like, ‘Well, it cost $50 million.’ Well, good for him that he’s making so much money. But those movies don’t exist in the zeitgeist. It’s almost like they don’t even exist.”Unlike a lot of the movies Tarantino has taken potshots at over the years, the director actually does have respect for “A Clockwork Orange”: Stanley Kubrick’s famously brutal film about an eloquent sociopath’s forced rehabilitation. In a 2003 interview with The New Yorker, Tarantino referred to the dystopian film’s first 20 minutes, during which Alex (Malcolm McDowell) engages in horifically violent crimes, as “pretty fucking perfect.”But Tarantino is fairly cold towards Kubrick’s work in general, and he went on to complain that the remainder of the film was a “hypocritical” work from the legend: “His party line was, ‘I’m not making a movie about violence, I’m making a movie against violence.’ And it’s just, like, ‘Get the fuck off. I know and you know your dick was hard the entire time you were shooting those first twenty minutes. You couldn’t keep it in your pants the entire time you were editing it and scoring it. You liked the rest of the movie, but you put up with the rest of the movie.'” Tarantino’s comments about “Selma” are a bit of an odd case, as he later offered a sort-of apology, and said he never actually saw the movie. But during a 2015 interview with author Bret Easton Ellis for T Magazine, the director seemed to give a backhanded compliment to Ava DuVernay’s film about the 1965 voting rights marches: “She did a really good job on ‘Selma’ but ‘Selma’ deserved an Emmy.” After his comment attracted backlash, Tarantino released a statement to IndieWire claiming that he never saw actually saw “Selma,” despite the quote, and that him claiming it should get an Emmy was “more like a question.” “Which basically meant, ‘it’s like a TV movie?'” Tarantino wrote in his statement to IndieWire. “Which Bret and myself being from the same TV generation, was not only understood, but there was no slam intended. Both Bret and myself come from the seventies and eighties when there were a lot of historically based TV movies: the King mini-series written by Abby Mann starring Paul Winfield; ‘Crisis at Central High’ with Joanne Woodward. And ‘Judge Horton and the Scottsboro Boys.’ These were great TV movies. I’d be honored to be placed next to those films. However, I haven’t seen it. Does it look like a seventies TV movie? Yes. Does it play like one, I don’t know, I haven’t seen it.”After the T Magazine interview ran, Ellis posted an unedited version of the piece on his official website; it has since been removed, but remains archived on the Wayback Machine. One section cut from the printed piece but included in Ellis’ draft sees him offer his hot takes on several films, both classics and new releases. During a discussion of Alfred Hitchcock’s work, Tarantino admitted that he’s not a fan of the master of suspense’s ouevre. In particular, he was dismissive of his 1959 suspense classic “North By Northwest,” which starred Cary Grant as a man on the run after getting caught in a conspiracy.“People discover ‘North by Northwest’ at 22 and think it’s wonderful when actually it’s a very mediocre movie,” Tarantino said. “Vertigo” is probably Hitchcock’s most universally acclaimed feature; it topped the 2012 Sight and Sound Critics Poll of the all-time best films, and is ranked 2nd on the 2022 poll. But in the unedited Ellis interview, Tarantino admitted he doesn’t like the seminal thriller — in fact, he’s not a fan of any of Hitchcock’s ’50s output. “They have the stink of the 50s which is similar to the stink of the 80s,” Tarantino said. In the unedited Ellis interview, Tarantino expressed mixed opinions about the films of Wes Anderson; he said he loved the Texas filmmaker’s debut “Bottle Rocket” and liked “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” but didn’t enjoy his beloved 1998 dramedy “Rushmore.” That film stars Jason Schwartzman as an eccentric private academy student, and Tarantino said his issue with the film was that he couldn’t connect with its lead.  “I never thought ‘Rushmore’ was as funny as everybody else did because I didn’t like Max,” Tarantino said. Aside from the classics and critically acclaimed indies that Tarantino weighed in on for the unedited Ellis interview, he also shared his take on a then extremely recent release: Guy Ritchie’s 2015 film reboot of spy TV show “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.” While Tarantino liked the first half of the action flick, he said the film’s second half fell apart.   “The first half was really funny and terrific but in the whole second half I’m like, ‘Oh, wait a minute, we were supposed to care about the bomb? What the fuck is going on here? I was supposed to pay attention to the stupid story?’”He also didn’t care for Alicia Vikander’s performance in the film as the female lead. “Henry Cavill was fantastic but I didn’t like the girl at all,” he said.Tarantino never said he outright hates “The Meaning of Life,” Monty Python’s 1983 sketch film, but he did share that it was one of the films that made him the most uncomfortable while watching.  Specifically, in 2004, the director revealed to the Irish Examiner that “The Autumn Years,” a sketch where director Terry Jones plays a man that continously vomits, is one of the only film scenes he can’t stand to watch.   “The only time I’ve ever had to look away, because I couldn’t bear to watch, was ‘The Meaning Of Life,’ when that fat bastard keeps being sick,” Tarantino said. “I felt really nauseous – it was just too much. I was looking around and I thought, ‘If anyone here is sick and I have to smell vomit, I’m going to hurl’. I just about held onto my lunch in the end, but I still can’t think about that scene without retching.”Tarantino dedicates a full chapter of “Cinema Speculation” to Brian De Palma’s 1972 psychological thriller “Sisters.” He compares De Palma to numerous contemporary filmmakers in his analysis, taking a snide swipe at Alfred Hitchcock’s “Frenzy”: a crime thriller starring Jon Finch also from 1972. “While De Palma liked making thrillers (for a little while, at least), I doubt he loved watching them,” Tarantino said. “Hitchcockian thrillers were for him a means to an end. That’s why when he was forced to return to the genre in the mid-eighties, they were so lackluster. Ultimately he resented having to make them and was bored with the form. Hitchcock’s ‘Frenzy’ might be a piece of crap, but I doubt Alfred was bored making it.” Reflecting on theater outings that impacted his childhood for “Cinema Speculation,” Tarantino recalled a double-feature his parents, uncle, and babysitter once attended as a double date. He slams two Robert Altman movies along the way.“The evening was not a success,” Tarantino said. “Not only did they not like the two movies, my stepfather and uncle proceeded to bitch about them for days after. ‘Brewster’ McCloud is one of the worst movies to ever carry a studio logo, and that’s fully acknowledging Altman also made ‘Quintet’ for a studio as well. ‘Quintet’ is just terrible, boring, and pointless.”Yes, “True Detective” is a TV show, not a film. But that didn’t stop Tarantino from giving his two cents about the show in a 2015 interview with New York Magazine, where he revealed he watched the first episode of the anthology’s first season before giving up. “I tried to watch the first episode of season one, and I didn’t get into it at all. I thought it was really boring,” Tarantino told New York Mag. “And season two looks awful. Just the trailer — all these handsome actors trying to not be handsome and walking around looking like the weight of the world is on their shoulders. It’s so serious, and they’re so tortured, trying to look miserable with their mustaches and grungy clothes.”That said, Tarantino isn’t a full-on anti-TV snob. During the same interview, he revealed that he watched “Justified” and “How I Met Your Mother,” and revealed that his favorite HBO show was, surprisingly, Aaron Sorkin’s “The Newsroom:” “That was the only show that I literally watched three times. I would watch it at seven o’clock on Sunday, when the new one would come on. Then after it was over, I’d watch it all over again. Then I would usually end up watching it once during the week, just so I could listen to the dialogue one more time.” In the same passage from “Cinema Speculation,” Tarantino continues, “But ‘Brewster McCloud’ is the cinematic equivalent of a bird shitting on your head. Nevertheless, it’s kind of amusing imagining my parents, and my young uncle, and my seventeen-year-old babysitter buying a ticket to ‘Brewster McCloud’ and expecting to see a real movie.” As revealed on the Video Archives podcast, Tarantino isn’t a fan of François Truffaut. The French New Wave director came up during a discussion of his contemporary Claude Chabrol (in an episode from August 2022). “[Chabrol’s] thrillers are drastically better than the abysmal Truffaut-Hitchcock movies, which I think are just awful,” Tarantino said. “I’m not a Truffaut fan that much anyway. There are some exceptions, the main one being ‘The Story of Adele H.’ But for the most part, I feel about Truffaut like I feel about Ed Wood. I think he’s a very passionate, bumbling amateur.”Tarantino’s distaste for Truffaut is reinforced by the novelization of his ninth film, “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.” Although Tarantino has said hero Cliff Booth’s film opinions are not necessarily reflective of his own, one passage seems to reflect the director-turned-narrator’s sincere feelings.“He tried Truffaut twice, but he didn’t respond to him,” Tarantino wrote in the novel. “Not because the films were boring (they were), but that wasn’t the only reason Cliff didn’t respond. The first two films he watched (in a Truffaut double feature) just didn’t grab him. The first film, ‘The 400 Blows,’ left him cold. He really didn’t understand why that little boy did half the shit he did.”In addition to slamming “The 400 Blows,” Cliff Booth takes a hard stance on “Jules and Jim”: Truffaut’s 1962 romantic tragedy set against World War I, starring Jeanne Moreau, Oskar Werner, and Henri Serre. “He thought the mopey dopes in ‘Jules and Jim’ were a fucking drag,” Tarantino wrote in the “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” novel.“Pulp Fiction” fans have suggested that Samuel L. Jackson’s character Jules and Tarantino’s cameo character Jimmy are references to Truffaut’s work. Tarantino has not confirmed this.Appearing alongside Judd Apatow on the podcast “Club Random with Bill Maher,” Tarantino criticized Sam Mendes’ World War I epic “1917.” It competed against “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” during the 2019 awards season, a fact Tarantino was quick to point out when Maher said the film ought to have “won all the awards.” “You’re too impressed by that!” Tarantino remarked of Maher’s effusive compliments on Mendes’ use of one-shot takes. Tarantino argued the film used too many invisible cuts that should have instead been consolidated. “I’m not saying they do a bad job of that… But if you’re going to do it, really fucking do it. Go 15 minutes per fucking take.”He continued, “I actually liked the movie, but my friend brought something up, and oh my god, once he brought it up I couldn’t unhear it. He was complaining about it because he felt it played too much like a video game. Now, I don’t play video games, so I don’t feel that per se. So [watching the film], I’m actually thinking it feels more innovative than maybe someone who plays video games does. But the person I was speaking to said, ‘It’s ‘Wolfenstein’ the movie.'”“There’s this famous Nazi-werewolf game called ‘Wolfenstein,'” Tarantino laughed. “It’s like ‘Wolfenstein’ the movie, but I’d like it better if it was ‘Wolfenstein’ the movie.” While (negatively) reviewing “1917” on Bill Maher’s podcast in December 2022, Tarantino also took aim at the Charlize Theron-starring action flick “Atomic Blonde.”“When I’m watching like the long fight in ‘Atomic Blonde,’ I’m like, ‘God. This is amazing! This is fucking amazing! OK… wait a minute, no,” he said. “‘The shot took a shit. The shot’s not going on this long, it took a shit.’ So it’s all tainted. It’s all tainted. Because obviously, they didn’t carry it through.”In a 1992 interview for LA Weekly (h/t Far Out), Tarantino spoke about maintaing a balanced relationship with studios. He cautioned against cozying up to big companies, but added: “If all you do is these little art films for 10 years for a million or two dollars, you’re going to climb up your own ass.”He contined: “I’m not ragging on other people, but after I saw ‘Twin Peaks — Fire Walk With Me’ at Cannes, David Lynch has disappeared so far up his own ass that I have no desire to see another David Lynch movie until I hear something different. And you know, I loved him. I loved him.”Though Tarantino wrote the script for Oliver Stone’s “Natural Born Killers” (an infamously dicey situation that left bad feelings on a few fronts), he still hasn’t be able to watch the movie from start to end. The screenwriter has lamented that Stone fundamentally misunderstood his story, rewriting portions that made the film’s characters unbelievable to Tarantino. “One of the things about that script, in particular, was that I was trying to make it on the page,” he said on The Moment podcast in 2021 (h/t Slash Film). “So when you read it, you saw the movie. And it’s like why didn’t [Stone] do at least half of that? It was done for him!”Wes Craven’s 1996 slasher-turned-horror juggernaut “Scream” was and is widely regarded as one of the best scary movies ever made. And yet, Tarantino once argued the classic, starring Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, and David Arquette, didn’t go far enough. “I actually didn’t care for Wes Craven’s direction of it,” the filmmaker told Vulture in 2015. “I thought he was the iron chain attached to its ankle that kept it earthbound and stopped it from going to the Moon.”Ben Affleck’s 2010 crime thriller is something of an outlier on this list, considering Tarantino specifically said he liked the film. But in a 2015 interview with Vulture (the same one in which he discussed “Scream”), the writer/director aired a specific complaint he had with the film’s “phony” casting.“‘The Fighter’ had impeccable casting,” he said. “As an example, I really liked ‘The Town,’ which also came out in 2010. It was a good crime film. However, next to ‘The Fighter’, it just couldn’t hold up, because everybody in ‘The Town’ is beyond gorgeous. Ben Affleck is the one who gets away with it, because his Boston accent is so good. But the crook is absolutely gorgeous. The bank teller is absolutely gorgeous…Jeremy Renner is the least gorgeous guy, and he’s pretty fucking good-looking. Then, if you look at ‘The Fighter,’ and you look at those sisters, they’re just so magnificent. When you see David O. Russell cast those sisters, and you see Ben Affleck cast Blake Lively, you can’t compare the two movies. One just shows how phony the other is.”Christopher Nolan’s time-traveling, sci-fi thriller was called a “humorless disappointment” by Mike McCahill in IndieWire’s review. Less pointed with his take (though perhaps that’s even more telling), Tarantino admitted during a podcast appearance in 2020 (h/t Slash Film) that he was utterly baffled by Nolan’s latest. “I think I need to see it again,” the filmmaker laughed.Bill Murray may have been a major box office draw in the ’80s and ’90s, but there’s at least one notable audience member he routinely failed to win over.In “Cinema Speculation,” Tarantino writes about the frustration he has with Murray’s feel-good films from that era: “Complex characters aren’t necessarily sympathetic. Interesting people aren’t always likable. But in the Hollywood of the eighties, likability was everything.”He continued: “If you did make a movie about a fucking bastard, you could bet that fucking bastard would see the error of their ways and be redeemed in the last twenty minutes. Like for example, all of Bill Murray’s characters.”Tarantino called out three films specifically; first, Ivan Reitman’s “Stripes.” “How does Murray in ‘Stripes’ go from being an iconoclastic pain in the ass, who deserves to get beat up by Drill Sergeant Warren Oates, to rallying the troops (‘That’s the fact, Jack!’), and masterminding a covert mission on foreign soil?” he complained. “And ‘Stripes’ was one of the hip movies.”Continuing with his complaints about Bill Murray protagonists from the ’80s, Tarantino writes in “Cinema Speculation”: “Film critics always preferred Bill Murray to Chevy Chase. Yet, more often than not, Chase remained the same sarcastic aloof asshole at the film’s end he was at the beginning. Or at least his conversion wasn’t the whole point of the movie as it was in ‘Scrooged’ and ‘Groundhog Day.'”Tarantino finishes his Murray comments for “Cinema Speculation,” writing: “Admittedly, when you don’t give a fuck about other people’s feelings, it probably does wonders for your caustic wit. But I’ve always rejected the idea that Bill Murray’s characters needed redemption. Yeah, maybe he charmed Andie MacDowell [in ‘Groundhog Day’], but does anybody think a less sarcastic Bill Murray is a better Bill Murray?”Tarantino famously loves Kinji Fukasaku’s dystopian thriller “Battle Royale,” having repeatedly listed it among his all-time favorite films. It’s no wonder then that the writer/director took a little ire with the remarkably similar “Hunger Games” franchise. “I’m a big fan of the Japanese movie ‘Battle Royale,’ which is what ‘Hunger Games’ was based on,” Tarantino explained in a 2022 appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! “Well, ‘Hunger Games’ just ripped it off. That would have been awesome to have directed ‘Battle Royale.’”“The sequels were horrible,” Tarantino complained of John Carpenter’s ‘Halloween’ franchise in a 2019 Consequence of Sound interview. “They’re like fruit from a poison tree because Laurie is not the brother of the Shape.” Criticizing the “Halloween II” twist that reveals Michael and Laurie are related, Tarantino said: “It’s horrible that it does that. There’s something far more scary that he’s going through Haddonfield and it’s just her…I think they just yanked some idea out of their ass, alright, and they just talked themselves into ‘Hey, well, this is why…’ and now part two has a reason.”Joining in Martin Scorsese’s crusade to save cinema, Tarantino recently charged Marvel with the (metaphoric) death of the movie star, though he hedged his comments considerably more than his contemporay. “Part of the Marvel-ization of Hollywood is…you have all these actors who have become famous playing these characters,” Tarantino said in an appearance on the “2 Bears, 1 Cave” podcast. “But they’re not movie stars, right? Captain America is the star. Or Thor is the star. I mean, I’m not the first person to say that. I think that’s been said a zillion times…but it’s like, you know, it’s these franchise characters that become a star.”He said of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films: “I don’t love them. No, I don’t. I don’t hate them, alright? But I don’t love them. Right. I mean, look, I used to collect Marvel comics like crazy when I was a kid. There’s an aspect that if these movies were coming out when I was in my twenties, I would totally be fucking happy and totally love them. I mean, they wouldn’t be the only movies being made. They would be those movies amongst other movies. But, you know, I’m almost 60, so yeah. No, I’m not quite as excited about them.”There’s a decent chance Tarantino hasn’t seen “The Force Awakens,” and with good reason. First, the director is a famed “Star Trek” guy. Second, he infamously sparred with Disney in December 2015 when a dispute over theater availability pitted “The Hateful Eight” against the sci-fi sequel from J.J. Abrams.“They’ve got the biggest movie in the world. We’re talking about one effing theater,” Tarantino told Howard Stern of the studio’s notoriously heavy-handed approach to securing the Cinerama Dome for “Star Wars” screenings. “It’s vindictive, it’s mean, and it’s extortion. They literally threatened the ArcLight to do this.”Few would deny the Wachowskis’ “The Matrix” is one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made. But for Tarantino, the pair of convoluted sequels to follow — “The Matrix Reloaded” and “The Matrix Revolutions” — were less than impressive. “That was the sword of Damocles hanging over our heads,” Tarantino said to Vulture in 2015, regarding the box office battle between “The Matrix Reloaded” and the first “Kill Bill.” “I saw ‘Matrix Reloaded’ at the Chinese Theatre the day it opened, and I walked out of the cinema singing that Jay-Z song [“S. Carter.”] I was like, ‘Bring it the fuck on. I was worried about that?’”In a 2009 interview with Sky Movies, Tarantino spoke about his 20 favorite films and called out “The Matrix Reloaded” and “The Matrix Revolutions” for losing “The Matrix” its previously high ranking on his list. (He instead listed the sci-fi classic at number 14, per the interview.)“There was a time actually that I would have considered ‘Matrix’ the official number two after ‘Battle Royale,'” Tarantino said. “However, I have to say that time was before ‘Matrix 2’ and ‘3’ came out and actually ruined the mythology for me. But even though it did ruin the mythology for me and actually moved the original ‘Matrix’ down on my list — frankly, I just can’t think about it the same way I did before — it didn’t obliterate it entirely.” ",

        "title": "The Classic American Movies That Normalized Sexual Harassment and Assault in the 20th Century",
        "content": "The ’70s and ’80s were an experimental time for movies. Sci-fi and horror reached new heights, with some of history’s most successful directors cutting their teeth on genre blockbusters before achieving awards glory in subsequent decades. But while old IP continues to inspire a plethora of remakes and reboots, some American classics don’t totally hold up.Aggressive sexual content disguised as comedy — often revolving around male characters refusing to take “no” for an answer — hits differently in a Hollywood that’s experienced the Me Too movement. What once seemed funny comes across as creepy, and directors handwaving these characters’ misbehavior can leave contemporary audiences questioning the artists’ motives.Even before the phrase was known to mainstream audiences, rape culture was a frequent topic of discussion for ’80s filmmakers. Many films explored the role that drugs and alcohol sometimes have in the seduction process, and the blurred ethical lines that can emerge from socializing in uninhibited settings. Often played off as raunchy humor, the idea of “what she doesn’t know won’t hurt her” was a widely accepted comedic trope at the time.The thought of a defenseless woman being taken advantage of is hardly a laughing matter for today’s audiences. And yet, despite the modern age of cancel culture, some of cinema’s most beloved, successful, and revered American classics feature artifacts from that bygone era. From a young age, generations of moviegoers are exposed to subliminal messages suggesting that consent isn’t a necessary prerequisite for dating, which only perpetuates that behavior in real life.Movies from that time period often placed responsibility and blame on women, and assault was portrayed as a predictable consequence of drinking and partying too hard. Although filmmakers are now more conscious of the sexist taboos and contemporary cultural boundaries, numerous American classics normalized sexual harassment and even assault.Comedy and sexuality are not perceived the same way they were 40 years ago, and that’s a good thing. And questionable sexual messaging doesn’t have to negate the good aspects of legendary movies, which is also a good thing. But rewatching these titles with a contemporary perspective allows us to observe the way our society has evolved while exploring the role that cinema might have played in establishing old social norms.Keep reading for our list of ten films worth reevaluation for their problematic depictions of sex and dating.John Landis’ college classic frequently touched on underage sexuality — and occasionally hinted at sexual abuse. In one particularly lewd scene, Larry “Pinto” Kroger contemplates date raping his freshman girlfriend after she passes out nude in his bed. At a crossroads, Larry’s conscience appears in the form of a devil and an angel on his shoulder. On his right, he’s advised to “fuck her brains out,” while the lighter left side of his soul warns, “You will despise yourself forever.” Using his better judgment, Larry rolls the girl in a shopping cart to her house where he leaves her passed out on the front porch for her father to find her. “I’m proud of you, Lawrence,” the angel says. “You homo,” the devil responds.A movie initially pitched to Disney before it was picked up by Universal, “Back to the Future” was the highest-grossing film of 1985. Robert Zemeckis’ film was deemed too risqué for the House of Mouse, which was turned off by Marty’s incestual relationship with his teenage mother Lorraine.In case you don’t know the film, Marty travels back 30 years in time, crossing paths with his parents’ high school versions. Although warry about altering the space-time continuum, Marty makes it his mission to drive his mother into his dad’s arms.Unfortunately for Marty, that means being as forceful and ungentlemanly as possible on the first date so his father Geroge could come to her rescue. Luckily(?) for Marty, the school bully Biff steps in to assault Lorraine before things get too far. Athough all is well in the end, the lengths Marty goes to protect his family’s future makes viewers wonder how he could still look his mother in the eyes when he returns to 1985.“Ghostbusters” features one of Bill Murray’s most prominent roles as Dr. Peter Venkman, a college professor who early in the film uses his position of power to fake ESP test results that would land him one-on-one time with a student he’s crushing on.Venkman’s same “coming on strong” style of flirting continues after he takes a liking to Sigourney Weaver’s Dana, a client of the Ghostbusters. After shutting down pickup lines and literally forcing him out of her apartment, Dana eventually agrees to go out with Venkman. When she gets picked up, however, Dana’s been possessed by the demonic entity that haunts her apartment. Thankfully for everyone involved, Venkman happens to have 300 cc’s of Thorazine on him, a powerful sedative that he administers to the possessed woman. Although he goes on to save the day, audiences were left to wonder why he coincidentally had the drugs on him.“Tell me more, tell me more!” Danny Zuko’s greaser friends melodically shout as they sing the backup vocals for John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John’s song “Summer Nights.” The questions that follow come from both the perspective of Sandy and Danny’s friends. The girls want to know if the summer connection was “love at first sight” while the boys want to know if Sandy “put up a fight.” After realizing they attend the same high school, the couple goes to the drive-in where Sandy is groped by her date before he climbs on top of her and smothers her with kisses against her will. Before she storms out of the movie, Danny lets her know not to worry and that “nobody is watching.” Now alone at the drive-in and forced to sit and wonder why she left him, Danny bursts into song, immediately regretting the decision that left him in misery. Set in 1954, “Porky’s” finds folly in the sexual promiscuity of six hormonal high school boys and the sex-crazed girls they meet in their youth. Coach Lynn “Lassie” Honeywell gets her nickname from the dog-like howls she cries out during sex. In the middle of gym class, Coach Brackett decides to find out for himself if the rumor is true. Leading her to the boys’ locker room, Lynn cannot contain herself as she is turned on by the pheromones of sweaty high school boy clothes. She pounces on Brackett before she howls loudly enough for the packed gym to hear.“Porky’s” also features a glory hole scene where the boys drill a hole into the girls’ locker room to watch them shower — and one of the boys even puts his penis through the hole before the party is broken up by a coach. Insistent that the offender be caught and brought to justice, a character named Balbricker asks the principal to let her inspect the nude boys to identify the penis with the mole she saw in her locker room.“Revenge of the Nerds” has some questionable scenes that have not aged well, to put it lightly. From hiding cameras in the dorms to spying on girls as they sleep, shower, and change to selling those nude photos at a fundraising booth, “Revenge of the Nerds” objectifies women in just about every sense of the word. Perhaps the most controversial moment in the movie, which has received backlash in recent years, is the “sex under false pretenses” scene where Lewis uses a Halloween costume to disguise himself, tricking Betty into thinking he is her jock boyfriend Stan. After Betty realizes she’s been misled and assaulted she is not upset but instead grateful for the “wonderful” encounter, asking Lewis “Are all nerds as good as you?” to which he confirms and replies “All jocks ever think about is sports. All we ever think about is sex.” Now a parent, the film’s director Jeff Kanew was later taken aback by the scene, reconsidering its humor.“It’s not excusable,” Kanew said in a 2019 interview with GQ. “If it were my daughter, I probably wouldn’t like it.”For many teenage girls in the ’80s “Sixteen Candles” pretty-boy Jake Ryan was a dream guy. Jake boasts about how easy it is for him to get laid, letting his friend Ted know that he has “Caroline passed out in the bed upstairs” and could “violate her 10 different ways if I wanted to.” That isn’t what Jake decides to do, but he instead passes his inebriated girlfriend off to Ted for him to drive her home. In his father’s Rolls-Royce, which he lent to Ted, Jake tells him to “have fun” with her as they pull out of the garage. In 2018, “Sixteen Candles” star Molly Ringwald wrote an essay published in The New Yorker speaking out about the problematic aspects of the movie.When “Top Gun” was released, aviator shades, bomber jackets, and Kenny Loggins took over American culture.But while the dogfights and sunsets were undeniably fun to watch, Tom Cruise’s Maverick throws off more than a few red flags with his flirting style. After serenading Charlie (Kelly McGillis) to The Righteous Brothers’ “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feelin’” in a packed bar, Maverick doesn’t hesitate to follow the woman he’s just met into the ladies’ restroom. Although they only trade a few lines during this scene, Charlie pops the question “What do you want to do, just drop right down on the tile and go for it?” to which Maverick replies “Actually I had this counter in mind,” through an awkward grin. Maybe his co-pilot Goose was right, Maverick does live his life between his legs.Although this film keeps the unwanted dirty talk and touching to a minimum, “Fast Times at Ridgemont High” features a notable plotline about statutory rape. When a 15-year-old freshman named Stacy befriends a sexually advanced senior, Linda, she’s coached on how to hook up with older guys, even practicing her oral skills in the school cafeteria. When she meets 26-year-old Ron, she knows he’s the perfect candidate to lose her virginity to. Lying and claiming she’s 19, Stacy has sex with Ron in a dingy baseball field dugout referred to as “the point.” Another John Hughes classic, “The Breakfast Club” has remained popular for generations despite some questionable content. Throughout the movie, Molly Ringwald’s character Claire is constantly harassed and disrespected by Judd Nelson’s John Bender. Things take a more serious turn when Bender finds himself met with Claire’s open legs as he hides underneath a table, avoiding Vice Principal Vernon. Played off as coughing, Claire muffles a sound, implying that she’s being touched under the table. When Bender comes up, he passes the clearly intentional incident off as an accident. ",

        "content": "Tom Cruise isn’t kicking his acting career into cruise control anytime soon.The “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” star and producer told the Sydney Morning Herald that he is determined to be acting at least for the next two decades, much like iconic screen star Harrison Ford. “Harrison Ford is a legend; I hope to be still going,” Cruise said. “I’ve got 20 years to catch up with him.”The “Eyes Wide Shut” actor added, “I hope to keep making ‘Mission: Impossible’ films until I’m his age.” (No word yet if he’ll also keep making “Top Gun” films.)Ford recently starred in franchise-ender “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” right before turning 81 this year; Cruise celebrated his 61st birthday on July 3, just weeks before “Dead Reckoning” debuts in theaters. Cruise’s comments also tease that “Dead Reckoning,” part one of the presumed end of the franchise, may not be Cruise’s final appearance as Ethan Hunt.Ford, who confirmed “Dial of Destiny” is his last stop as Indiana Jones, said during “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace?” that he is not retiring anytime soon. “I don’t do well when I don’t have work. I love to work,” Ford said. “I love to feel useful. I want to be helpful.”Fellow cinema greats Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino have similarly spoken out about expectations over slowing down their respective careers. “Killers of the Flower Moon” auteur Scorsese promised he still has stories to tell, whereas Tarantino confirmed his tenth and final film “The Movie Critic” will be his last feature film.“It’s just time to go out. I like the idea of going out on top,” Tarantino said. “I like the idea of giving it my all for 30 years and then saying, ‘OK, that’s enough.’ And I don’t like working to diminishing returns. And I mean, now is a good time because I mean, what even is a motion picture anyway anymore? Is it just something that they show on Apple? That would be diminishing returns.”",

        "content": "The editor-in-chief at GQ who was involved in the decision to pull an article critical about Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav is also producing a movie at Warner Bros. Pictures, according to a new report by Variety.On Monday, GQ ran a story by freelance film critic Jason Bailey titled “How Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav Became Public Enemy Number One in Hollywood.” As The Washington Post detailed earlier today, the article was edited from its original version and later pulled after Bailey asked for his byline to be removed from it. The Post reported that the decision to edit the piece came after individuals at Warner Bros. Discovery complained to the magazine about the story, which in its original version compared Zaslav to “Succession” character Logan Roy and to Richard Gere’s businessman character in “Pretty Woman.”However, as Variety reported, one of the individuals contacted was reportedly GQ Editor-in-Chief Will Welch, who is also attached as a producer to a film set up at Warner Bros. called “The Great Chinese Art Heist.” The film is to be directed by “Wicked” and “Crazy Rich Asians” filmmaker Jon M. Chu, with a script by Ken Cheng, Jessica Gao, and Jimmy O. Yang; it’s based on a 2018 GQ article.A Warner Bros. Pictures representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether the project is still in development at the studio or if Welch remains attached as a producer. However, a Warner Bros. Discovery rep told Variety that no one at the corporate level was aware of Welch’s ties to the movie studio.As for the decision about the edits to the piece, a Warner Bros. Discovery spokesperson said Bailey did not reach out for comment on the piece before publishing.“The freelance reporter made no attempt to reach out to Warner Bros. Discovery to fact-check the substance of the piece before publishing — a standard practice for any reputable news outlet. As is also standard practice, we contacted the outlet and asked that numerous inaccuracies be corrected. In the process of doing so, the editors ultimately decided to pull the piece,” a WBD spokesperson told IndieWire.“A piece published by GQ on Monday was not properly edited before going live. After a revision was published, the writer of the piece asked to have their byline removed, at which point GQ decided to unpublish the piece in question. GQ regrets the editorial error that led to a story being published before it was ready,” a spokesperson for GQ told Variety.GQ did not immediately respond to IndieWire’s request for comment. A rep for Chu did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

        "content": "The “Beverly Hills Cop” franchise almost steered “Speed” away from audiences.The Eddie Murphy comedy-action vehicle was once briefly on the brink of taking over the “Speed” script before Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock were attached to star, according to former Paramount vice president of production Don Granger.During Kris Tapley’s latest episode of the “50 MPH” podcast, which offers a comprehensive oral history of “Speed,” Granger revealed that stalled negotiations for “Speed” led him to pitch the screenplay as a “Beverly Hills Cop III” script.“I really wanted to try to mount the movie, and my last-ditch effort was … I pitched it at our chairman’s lunch as a possible script for ‘Beverly Hills Cop III,'” Granger said. “I got about 15 minutes of traction before it was dismissed, because that was back when the mandate was to find a ‘Beverly Hill Cop III.’ So I was like, ‘Let’s put Axel Foley on the bus.’ It was a Hail Mary, man.”Granger continued, “I might maintain it was a better movie, it would have been a better movie than ultimately what we got for ‘Beverly Hills Cop III,’ but that was my final Hail Mary.”“Speed,” of course, became a 20th Century Fox 1994 blockbuster directed by Jan de Bont. The film spurred 1997 sequel “Speed 2: Cruise Control,” which Bullock admitted last year that she is “still embarrassed” about. “I’ve been very vocal about it. Makes no sense. Slow boat. Slowly going towards an island,” Bullock said. “That’s one I wished I hadn’t done and no fans came around, that I know of.”“Speed” star Reeves famously turned down the sequel, despite the original film’s box office success and Oscar wins for Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing. Reeves later revealed he was put in “movie jail” by 20th Century Fox for exiting the film. Jason Patric instead starred opposite Bullock as her new love interest.Check out more about the podcast right here.",

        "title": "How ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Put Indy Into the Apollo 11 Ticker-Tape Parade",
        "content": "[Editor’s note: The following interview contains spoilers.]Harrison Ford’s Indiana Jones is back in fine form for swan song “The Dial of Destiny,” dodging former Nazi rival Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) alongside estranged goddaughter/treasure hunter Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) while chasing after Archimedes’ Antikythera (the titular dial).But director James Mangold fully embraced the senior daredevil archaeologist being out of step in the turbulent ’60s, putting Indy firmly in the time period by collaborating with production designer Adam Stockhausen (“Asteroid City”) on several action-packed historical recreations. Audiences see everything from the Nazi castle and plunder train during the 1944 prologue (boasting a de-aged Ford by ILM) and the Apollo 11 astronaut ticker-tape parade in New York City to the Ear of Dionysius cave in Sicily and a battle with the invading Romans in 213 BCE.“We had a very unusual early process where I was able to do sketching work in real-time as [Mangold] was developing the script,” Stockhausen told IndieWire. “We were able to test out ideas for the main sequences to see if they worked visually and how they fit together. We worked on the whole story this way.”The design process (assisted by set decorator Anna Pinnock and supervising art director Martin Foley) began with Sicily, home of legendary Greek mathematician Archimedes. The Antikythera he invented was a mechanical model of the solar system used to predict the relative positions and motions of the planets and moons. However, Mangold elevated it into a more fantastical time travel-enabling device split into two pieces for the globe-trotting treasure hunt.“He was thinking about Archimedes as a main ingredient and so we started where the story starts — in Sicily, where he lived,” Stockhausen continued. “We looked at the Ear and thought it could make a good entrance into the [Archimedes] tomb sequence. I didn’t necessarily think we would end up shooting there, but as we got into scouting Sicily, it started to offer more and more pieces that were helpful to us in putting the whole thing together. It’s sort of rare and wonderful when something works out so well and you get to film at one of the places that first inspired an idea.”For the battle in ancient Syracuse, the goal was to make it as gritty and real as possible to minimize blue screening by ILM (under the production VFX supervision of Andrew Whitehurst). “We were shooting in Sicily again, and up at the very tip in the northwest corner was an old tuna fishing canning site,” Stockhausen said. “And so there’s this crumbling wreckage of this building, but it’s in the most spectacular sort of natural bay, and so we augmented it and grew the city behind it. Andrew and his team developed the whole city beyond the walls as well as the Roman navy. But we used a lot of the old stone board, a lot of the old sandstones of this building as the basis of our ancient Syracuse.”The World War II opening depicting the American advance in occupied France consisted of both on-site and sound stage shooting. The beautiful hall for the plunder was shot at Bamburgh Castle in Northumberland (among the films they referenced was “Where Eagles Dare”), while the interior train shots were done on stage at Pinewood. “There is just so much actual material. Hitler had a train there. There’s great documentation on it, not to say that we copied it exactly,” Stockhausen said. “But there’s just a huge amount to springboard it off, the kind of ‘Monuments Men’ tracking of the arts and the entire Nazi plunder regime.”But Stockhausen’s most elaborate re-enactment was the New York leg of the Apollo 11 ticker-tape parade (shot on location in the central business district of Glasgow, Scotland). The parade took place a month after the July 20 moon landing and culminates with the surreal sight of Indy racing for his life on horseback from Nazis and CIA agents, climaxing in the New York City subway.“We kind of lifted it as much as we could from the look of it,” said Stockhausen. “Taking the London crew up to Glasgow was much more reasonable than everybody flying to New York. They were really open to closing down the streets for the [two weeks] that we needed them. It was a really big footprint there. I can’t imagine being able to shut down Park Avenue for that length of time. It required lots of storefronts, lots of signage, there’s digital extension, but as you see in the film, he’s on horseback moving at speeds. So we had a lot of set to work with and just the atmosphere itself of putting on a big parade with 500 people. We had two long avenue blocks in New York terminology. And then the side streets were all dressed up, all shop fronts, all signs.”The subway sequence, though, was shot at Pinewood because they didn’t have access to the London tube or the subway museum in Brooklyn used for “Bridge of Spies.” “We had to run the horse and do the practical horse stunts on the set,” he added. “And so that had to be built. So we were in the 007 stage at Pinewood and built from one end to the other end and out the door. ”How fitting with Ford doing his final turn as the Bond-inspired Indy outmaneuvering the over-matched baddies and CIA agents. “It was a rare and incredible opportunity,” Stockhausen said.",

        "title": "Robert Englund Is Ready for Freddy Kreuger to Be Recast for Potential ‘Nightmare on Elm Street’ Reboot",
        "content": "Robert Englund is ready to wake up from “A Nightmare on Elm Street.”The iconic franchise star, who has portrayed Freddy Kreuger across eight films since 1984, revealed that “Freddy vs. Jason” was the last stand for his take on the character.“I kind of knew after 2004 that I wasn’t up to playing Freddy again,” Englund told Insider while promoting documentary “Hollywood Dreams & Nightmares: The Robert Englund Story,” adding, “I was in my 50s, and ‘Freddy vs. Jason’ took a lot out of me.”Englund was “still doing a lot of my stunts,” including underwater scenes, but the film proved that he was done with the role due to his age. “I kind of knew I didn’t have a lot of stunt work left in me, or a lot of takes to physicalize it,” Englund said. “And my torso had shifted, along with my face getting older, which doesn’t matter because I’m under all that crap — that makeup. But my torso … your weight shifts, and you get thicker as you get older. And I sort of lost Freddy’s silhouette.”The “Stranger Things” star continued, “I might have had another Freddy or two in me back in 2005 to 2010, but I don’t any longer. They need to find a new Freddy. It could be somebody unknown or it could be someone established, like Kevin Bacon. … I would be honored if maybe they invited me to do a cameo.”Englund noted that filmmaker Jordan Peele could even take over the franchise, saying, “There’s extraordinary work being done now. I don’t want to live in a world without Jordan Peele. ‘Get Out’ is absolute genius.”A potential remake wouldn’t mark the first time Freddy’s striped sweater was worn by someone other than Englund: The 2010 remake of the original “Elm Street” starred Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy. However, Englund recently told Variety that the film changed the franchise for the worse.“Jackie’s just so good, a wonderful actor, so I don’t think it was that,” Englund said. “I’ve always thought that Freddy is described as a child killer. So when they made Freddy a child molester [in the remake], that’s not what Freddy is, I don’t think. By taking it to such a dark, dark place, there’s no room for the personality of Freddy to be exploited.”",

        "title": "James Mangold Confirms Bob Dylan Gave Timothée Chalamet Notes on ‘A Complete Unknown’",
        "content": "Bob Dylan made his comments known for upcoming film “A Complete Unknown.”The highly-anticipated feature, helmed by James Mangold, stars Timothée Chalamet as the “Tangled Up in Blue” folk icon. However, Mangold noted during the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast that the film is not a traditional biopic, but rather an ensemble period piece reminiscent of Robert Altman’s work.“By the way, it’s not really a Bob Dylan biopic,” Mangold said. “The reason Bob has been so supportive of us making it, is it’s about, as in all cases I think of the best true-life movies are never cradle to grave but they’re about a very specific moment. In this case, it might sound Altman-esque, but it’s a kind of ensemble piece about this moment in time, the early ’60s in New York, and this 17-year-old kid with $16 in his pockets hitchhikes his way to New York to meet Woody Guthrie who is in the hospital and is dying of a nerve disease.”Mangold continued, “And he sings Woody a song that he wrote for him and befriends Pete Seeger, who is like a son to Woody, and Pete sets him up with gigs at local clubs and there you meet Joan Baez and all these other people who are part of this world, and this wanderer who comes in from Minnesota with a fresh name and a fresh outlook on life, becomes a star, signs to the biggest record company in the world within a year, and three years later, has record sales rivaling The Beatles.”Dylan himself gave notes on the script, which Mangold said he now treasures. “I’ve spent several, wonderfully charming, days in his company, just one-on-one, talking to him,” the “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” director said. “I have a script that’s personally annotated by him and treasured by me. He loves movies. The first time I sat down with Bob, one of the first things he said to me was, ‘I love “Copland.”‘”“A Complete Unknown,” which was originally titled “Going Electric,” will center on the “upheaval in the folk community” as caused by Dylan’s disruptive sound, as Mangold explained.“It all has tremendous relevance even now because of the way we are all so tribalized with rules about what our music should be, about what our rules are, how we speak, how we express ourselves,” he said. “And Bob from the beginning has always been someone who is always pressing against those boundaries.”In addition to Chalamet, the film stars Benedict Cumberbatch, Elle Fanning, Boyd Holbrook, Monica Barbaro, and Nick Offerman. Chalamet will also sing Dylan’s songs in “A Complete Unknown.”“It’s such an interesting true story and about such an interesting moment in the American scene,” Mangold said earlier this year, noting that “of course” Chalamet will sing onscreen.Check out Mangold’s recent interview with IndieWire here.",

        "title": "Child-Trafficking Drama ‘Sound of Freedom’ Opens to More Than $11.5 Million",
        "content": "With a rare Tuesday opening, “Sound of Freedom” (Angel Studios), a drama starring Jim Caviezel as a real-life rescuer of children from traffickers, grossed $11,563,200 — just under the day’s total for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” (Disney), which played in almost 2,000 more theaters with just under $11.7 million.Another difference: “Indiana Jones” often played on multiple screens. Based on theater spot-checks, “Freedom” played mostly single screens, often with smaller capacities, and saw sold-out shows. The result was a stark contrast in the films’ per-theater average: “Indiana” was about $2,543 in 4,600 theaters, while “Freedom” saw about $4,400 in 2,634 theaters.Angel also reported that its “Pay It Forward” promotion grossed an additional $2,679,000 thanks to patrons buying gift tickets for others for future use. Under normal industry practice, that revenue should be counted as they are used. With that among added, the day’s take for the film exceeded $14.2 million, which would make it #1 for the day.Originally produced by Fox International and later shelved by Disney, director Alejandro Monteverde and producer Eduardo Verástegui (best known as the executive producer of the 2019 anti-abortion drama “Unplanned) shot the film in 2018 in Cartagena, Colombia.“Freedom” is now distributed by the Provo, Utah-based Angel Studios, which specializes in “wholesome” content. (It offers the genres of Christian, comedy, drama, documentary, and kids’ shows.) The film’s reported budget is around $15 million.The opening, impressive under any conditions, was enhanced by group sales (with the additional marketing hook of elevating the initial gross) and by block sales to churches, with some reported to give away tickets to congregants.Driven by the outspoken Caviezel’s proven appeal to the faith-based community (“The Passion of the Christ”), this is an elevated example of films finding a passionate (and profitable) audience outside the mainstream film media. “Freedom” isn’t even listed on the website of review aggregator Metacritic, which normally lists all but the most obscure releases.Earlier this year, Angel released “His Only Son,” based on the Old Testament story of Abraham and Isaac. With a reported budget of $250,000, it grossed $12 million.In one day, “Freedom” grossed more the full domestic runs of recent awards contenders like “The Banshees of Inisherin,” “TAR,” and “Women Talking.” Its gross nearly doubles that of current independent hit “Past Lives” (A24).“Indiana Jones” stands currently around $84 million domestic, boosted in the last two days by the holiday. A better test of whether it can recover from its weak initial results will come during its second weekend.",

        "title": "‘Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One’ Review: Tom Cruise Escalates His War Against Streaming with Actioner About Evil of Algorithms",
        "content": "It’s no secret that Tom Cruise cares more about the survival of the movie business — or at least the movie business as he’s known it, and helped to shape in his own image — than anyone else has ever cared about anything else. Sure, we’re talking about a guy who seems to care about everything more than anyone else cares about anything, but the fight against the future has grown increasingly personal for “modern” Hollywood’s signature mega-star, whose first “Mission: Impossible” movie helped transmute him into a living emblem of the movies themselves.What others might see as a content-driven culture war, Cruise naturally regards as an existential threat, and the last few years have seen the actor-producer channel his singularly clenched intensity into a holy crusade against the standard-lowering forces of digital technology (the Eighth Dynamic saves its toughest battles for its strongest warriors). Motion-smoothing might just be a setting that you need to change on your parents’ TV, but Cruise sees it as a vast conspiracy to make people more apathetic towards the viewing experience. Venture capital might have sold the masses on the idea that movie theaters are a relic of the analog era, but Cruise sees them as irreplaceable churches where alienated strangers can be united in the light of the collective imagination (and codify his ever-inflating savior complex). A.I. might promise to make your life easier, but Cruise sees it as a willful surrender of human agency, an affront to objective reality, and — perhaps most of all — a massive “fuck you” to a multiplex icon who frequently risks his life to restore the relationship between seeing and believing. Anyone who saw “Top Gun: Maverick” knows that Cruise isn’t shy about confronting these concerns on-screen, and since everyone saw (and believed) that Best Picture-nominated mega-hit despite the supposed death of cinema, it stands to reason that Cruise’s next blockbuster — the goofy, romantic, and often transcendently committed “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” — should escalate his beef with the machines to hilariously literal new heights. Indeed, the last four “Missions” have brought consistency to this once-chameleonic franchise by focusing on Ethan Hunt’s all too human vulnerabilities; namely, the super-spy’s attachment to his estranged wife (Michelle Monaghan, whose storyline was resolved in 2018’s majestic “Fallout”), and how such intimate relationships tend to get in the way of saving the world. It’s hard for anyone to prioritize the greater good when their own happiness is hanging in the balance, but Hunt’s ultimate strength has always been his ability to make the impossible choice. That Hunt is a real person under his various masks is what makes him so dangerous, and that he’s played by the most alien and unrelatable of movie stars is what makes him so compelling. Over time, the “Mission: Impossible” series has forged a cohesive identity through its obsession with balancing the human element against bottom-line calculations, and that’s why it’s become such a natural place for Cruise to motorcycle into traffic around the Arc de Triomphe, fly a motorcycle off the top of a mountain in Norway, or otherwise showcase that he’s the only A-lister mad enough to save the movies from themselves. These death-defying spectacles risk becoming snuff films in the service of self-preservation; absent the unbridled nostalgia of “Maverick,” the forward-thinking new installment feels like nothing less than a $300 million backdrop for Cruise to argue that blockbusters can’t afford to lose their last shred of believability. “Mission: Impossible” has always taken place in a shadow world where you can’t believe your own two eyes, and so it feels natural for “Dead Reckoning Part One” to take such direct aim at the clear and present dangers posed by our digital future. By re-re-re-affirming how satisfying practical action setpieces can be, Cruise and returning director Christopher McQuarrie set the stage for a story about why technology shouldn’t be fully entrusted with the things that require a human touch. Ridiculous from the start but also strangely fresh for yet another 21st century tentpole about a rogue A.I., “Dead Reckoning Part One” may not be the best movie in the “Mission: Impossible” franchise — there’s no topping the raw adrenaline rush of “Fallout,” and McQuarrie is smart enough not to try — but this extravagantly entertaining Dolby soap opera nails what the “Mission: Impossible” franchise does best: Weaponizing artifice and illusion in order to fight for a world that’s still worth believing in.That being said, the decision to make the bad guy a string of code or whatever — with heavy emphasis on the whatever — can’t help but feel a bit like throwing in the towel, least of all in a series that’s suffered from a serious villain problem from the very beginning (Philip Seymour Hoffman being the sole and undeniable exception). Which isn’t to say that Ethan Hunt and his pals at the Impossible Mission Force are tasked with defeating a bad piece of malware or another run of the mill Skynet ripoff. Far from it. “The Entity,” as it’s referred to approximately every five seconds over the course of this luxurious 163-minute film, is a piece of A.I. so elegant that it decides to throw an “Eyes Wide Shut”-like costume ball for itself in a Venetian palace (classic Entity behavior), and so elaborate that its master plan will take an entire second film to fully unpack. At one point someone tells Hunt that he’s “playing four-dimensional chess with an algorithm,” but it’s a match that McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen’s script largely streamlines into the series’ usual game of high-wire MacGuffin chasing, with the Entity convinced that it has enough data to predict Hunt’s every move.Essentially, the streaming algorithm identifies Tom Cruise as the only person who can stop it, and therefore does everything in its power to kill him; art imitating life imitating art. Little does the Entity know that it’s dealing with the living manifestation of destiny himself, now rebranded as “a mind-reading, shape-shifting incarnation of chaos.” If the deeply satisfying “Dead Reckoning Part One” only feels unfinished or half-told because of the human stooge the Entity hires to do its bidding: A zero-impression terrorist named Gabriel (Esai Morales) who was supposedly instrumental in Hunt’s decision to join the IMF all those years ago. We learn next to nothing about their overlapping pasts over the course of this movie, which feels like an egregious oversight because Gabriel has so little to offer beyond generic intrigue, sinister handsomeness, and an unstoppable crony of his own (a homicidal Pom Klementieff, electrifying despite the tropiness of the whole “silent Asian henchwoman” archetype). What the “mysterious figure from Hunt’s past” approach really offers this movie is a different and more classically melodramatic tone than we got from the franchise’s last few installments, as “Dead Reckoning” pivots away from the orgiastic action that shaped “Fallout,” and towards something that more closely resembles a high-octane “Death in Venice” or a John Frankenheimer remake of “Roman Holiday” than it does the likes of “Fury Road.” There are still plenty of bullets fired, but there’s also a moonlit sword fight between Gabriel and Rebecca Ferguson’s ice-cold (and oh so cool) Ilsa Faust atop the Ponte Minich, a luminous bridge in the Sestiere Castello. Cruise still gets to sprint around with stop-motion stiffness (that he thinks he’s 40 is a lot more noticeable than the fact that he’s actually 61), but this Hunt always seems to be running away from something even when he’s hurtling towards something else. In stark contrast to several of the previous “Mission”s, Hunt and his team, headlined as usual by Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames’ snippy hackers, are presented as more prey than predator. Likewise, this movie’s rather small array of action setpieces — all of them fresh, tactile, and utterly spectacular in a way that continues to put the rest of Hollywood to shame — are less dependent on what the spies are trying to accomplish than what they’re hoping to avoid. Or escape. Case in point: The frantic and extremely funny mid-film chase through the streets of central Rome, during which Hunt is handcuffed to the sexy pickpocket (franchise newcomer Hayley Atwell) who might be able to lead him to the MacGuffin. A jaw-dropping “how the fuck did they do that?” mega-flex in an age when movies are seldom magical enough to beg that question, the city-wide jailbreak combines artfully destructive slapstick with the loudest car crashes you’ve ever heard to create the kind of cinematic euphoria that still can’t be faked or forged at home (VR headsets might allow rich people to enjoy IMAX-sized screens on their living room couches, but “Dead Reckoning” is a bone-shaking reminder that sound is the real secret weapon of the theatrical experience). Not since “La Dolce Vita” has a film more effectively transformed ancient Rome into a modern playground, a fitting touch for a blockbuster so desperate to squeeze a few new dollops of joy from the ruins that surround it. Oh, one more insane flex while we’re on the subject: Shooting an elaborate first-act heist sequence, complete with hundreds of extras and a nuclear bomb, in the world’s biggest airport terminal just before it opened to the public. The wow factor might not rate alongside the Rome chase to come, but hyper-convincing production design and a frightening degree of directorial confidence make for a powerful combination, and McQuarrie has so much fun with the space that you’re basically all-in for whatever the movie does next by the time “Dead Reckoning” takes off from Abu Dhabi. This being a “Mission: Impossible” movie, it goes without saying that Hunt is also trying to avoid the government that supposedly cuts his checks, and “Dead Reckoning” finds the super-spy going more rogue than he’s ever gone rogue before. The IMF has long acted like Dennis the Menace to the CIA’s Mr. Wilson, but — in another overt nod to the past, this one a lot more rewarding than what Gabriel brings to the picture — the tension between the two is ramped up even further by the reappearance of Hunt’s second-least favorite colleague from the first “Mission: Impossible” almost 30 years ago: The fantastically punchable Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny, reprising the role as only he could). And Kittridge of course has a goon squad of his own, with Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis playing a pair of enforcers who add a pinch of “are we the baddies?” flavor to the periphery of every major action sequence. You see, Hunt doesn’t trust any country on Earth with control of the Entity, including his own. Power is never safe in the hands of anyone who cares about algorithmic data more than people. Nevertheless, “Dead Reckoning” is only able to cast our digital future as an enemy unto itself because its heroes wield some pretty spiffy technology of their own, and it would be wrong to suggest the “Mission: Impossible” movies outright reject the tools of modern Hollywood. Tom Cruise might be the world’s least insurable film star, but he’s not Amish.The marketing campaign for this sequel kicked off with a behind-the-scenes look at “the biggest stunt in cinema history,” in which Cruise drives a Honda CRF 250 off the peak of a Norwegian mountain and then plunges 4,000 feet into a ravine before opening his parachute, and even that head-shaking tribute to practical magic made it clear that the full effect — still a heart-in-your-throat experience after eons of hype — was only possible with the help of some computer enhancement. The trick remains using such tools responsibly; striking the right balance between humanity and artificiality. It’s a line that Cruise has needed to walk since the early days of his stardom, only for that walk to become a high-wire act after the couch-jumping Scientology of it all made it that much harder for audiences to see themselves in his screen persona. What allows “Dead Reckoning Part One” to become more than the sum of its semi-modular parts is McQuarrie’s gift for expressing character through action, especially during a climactic setpiece that challenges Hunt to forfeit what little is left of his soul. A glorified trolley problem set aboard the Orient Express, the situation itself is pretty standard for the “Mission” series, but the terms here are a bit starker and more nuanced than ever before. Likewise, the action might seem small-scale when compared to the CGI bonanzas that today’s audiences have been conditioned to expect from the third act of a studio blockbuster, but it’s conducted with such convincing force that it feels bigger and more involving than anything the Avengers have ever had to face (it also feels like a nod back to action cinema’s silent roots, when all you needed to make a great movie was a guy, some guns, and a really big train). Besides, expectations can be misleading. The Entity might be able to throw itself a banging shindig, but even the most advanced predictive learning algorithms on the planet can’t fully account for the human element. The future isn’t written yet — nothing is certain. The movies and/or the world might be trending in one direction, but it’s never too late to adjust course. “Our lives are the sum of our choices,” someone gravely intones at one point, and Tom Cruise is willing to risk his life to remind us that we can still choose what we want tomorrow to look like. Then again, saving the world isn’t much of a choice when you’re the only one who can do it, and “Dead Reckoning Part One” makes pretty damn clear that Ethan Hunt has no equal. That bodes well for “Dead Reckoning Part Two.” Much less so for everything that follows.Paramount Pictures will release “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” in theaters on Wednesday, July 12.",

        "content": "This year’s Toronto International Film Festival is continuing to take shape. Today, the festival has announced the world premiere of Ladj Ly‘s “Les Indésirables,” which also gives film fans a glimpse at the first international title to be announced from this year’s slate.It will not be Ly’s first TIFF appearance: the French filmmaker previously screened his “Les Misérables” at the 2019 festival. That film received the Jury Prize at Cannes, was nominated for a Palme d’Or at Cannes as well as several César awards, and ultimately earned an Academy Award nomination for Best International Feature.Per today’s announcement, the festival promises that “Ly continues to push artistic boundaries, offering audiences a thought-provoking cinematic experience.” “We are honored to showcase Ladj Ly’s remarkable talent once again with the World Premiere of his latest work, ‘Les Indésirables,’” said Cameron Bailey, CEO, TIFF in an official statement. “This deeply personal film beautifully captures the struggles and aspirations of a community, reflecting Ly’s unparalleled storytelling skills.” Per the festival’s official synopsis: the film is “set in the suburbs on the outskirts of Paris” and “is a timely tale of revolution, which beautifully captures a pivotal moment in history. ‘Les Indésirables’ stars Alexis Manenti, Jeanne Balibar, Steve Tientcheu, Anta Diaw, and Aristote Luyindula. After the sudden death of a town’s mayor, Pierre (Manenti), an idealistic young doctor, is appointed to replace him. He intends to continue the policy of his predecessor, who dreamed of rehabilitating this working-class neighbourhood. Haby (Diaw), a young French woman of Malian origin living in one of the dilapidated tower blocks, refuses to see her family driven out of the neighborhood where she grew up.”Maneti previously starred in Ly’s “Les Misérables,” and earned a Cesar Award for best male newcomer for his performance.When the film was first announced last December, Variety reported that “the two-hander film will chronicle the young woman’s emancipation, and explore the tumult of a French suburb whose inhabitants are threatened by gentrification plans. Although the movie will have a political backdrop, the producers said it will be more novelistic than Ly’s debut movie, and will follow complex characters ‘who are neither good or bad.'”The film will be up for sale at the festival.As was previously announced, this year’s festival will also play home to the world premiere of Taika Waititi’s “Next Goal Wins.” More announcements will be coming in the following weeks. This year’s festival runs September 7 – 17.",

        "title": "Robert Eggers Says ‘Nosferatu’ Remake Was Almost a ‘Failure’: We Survived a ‘Difficult Shoot’",
        "content": "Robert Eggers is grateful to have had more experience directing intense ensemble films prior to sinking his teeth into his long-gestating “Nosferatu” remake.The writer-director revealed to Empire magazine that he is grateful to have helmed Viking epic “The Northman” before tackling “Nosferatu,” which has been in the works since 2016. Eggers’ lifelong goal has been to remake the 1922 vampire classic by F. W. Murnau; Eggers’ muse Anya Taylor-Joy was officially cast in the project by 2017 but left the project last year due to scheduling conflicts.“I’m trying to go beyond what I’m capable of,” Eggers told Empire. “As always, it was a difficult shoot. Last night we were doing a scene on a ship with a lot of rain and waves, and the rain deflector, which tries to blow rain out of the lens, was breaking down and fogging. I spent the past several days working only with Russian sailors on a boat.”He added, “I’m so happy to have made ‘The Northman’ first and to have learned what I learned. When I think about the production plan of ‘Nosferatu’ that we had the first time around, I’m sure I would have somehow pulled it out of my butt, but it’s hard not to imagine it being a failure.”“Nosferatu” also stars Bill Skarsgård, “The Idol” breakout Lily-Rose Depp, Nicholas Hoult, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Eggers’ longtime collaborator Willem Dafoe.“Willem’s up for anything and he’ll cut his arm off for the scene,” Eggers said of “The Lighthouse” actor. “He is a fucking pleasure to work with: he was in ‘The Northman,’ he was in [the upcoming] ‘Nosferatu,’ I hope I never made a movie without him.”The official synopsis for Focus Features’ “Nosferatu” teases the film as a gothic tale of obsession between a haunted young woman in 19th-century Germany and the ancient Transylvanian vampire who stalks her, bringing untold horror with him.Writer-director Eggers previously told IndieWire that the film had “fallen apart twice” before going into production. One iteration had Harry Styles attached in the role Hoult is now playing. The COVID-19 pandemic pushed “Nosferatu” back until after “The Northman” was completed.“I’ve been trying so hard,” Eggers said of attempting the remake. “And I just wonder if Murnau’s ghost is telling me, like, you should stop.”",

        "title": "‘Killers of the Flower Moon’ Full Trailer: Martin Scorsese’s Latest Epic Set for IMAX Release",
        "content": "Martin Scorsese‘s films deserve to be seen on the big screen, and Apple is giving the acclaimed director’s latest the biggest screens possible. Scorsese’s upcoming Western epic “Killers of the Flower Moon” will receive a run in IMAX theaters upon its release, Apple announced Wednesday. The company shared the news along with the release of the full trailer for the film, which can be watched below.Based on the non-fiction book of the same name by journalist David Grann, “Killers of the Flower Moon” is set in the 1920s on the Oklahoma land of the Osage Nation native tribe. During the turn of the century, oil was discovered in the area, turning the Osage into some of the richest people in the world. The new wealth of the tribe lead to tragedy, however, as at least 60 Osage were reported murdered between 1918 and 1931.A FBI investigation into the murders eventually found cattleman William Hale (played by frequent Scorsese muse Robert De Niro) as the mastermind behind the plot to eliminate the Osage to gain control of the rights of their oil. The film follows the events of the murders through the perspectives of Hale’s nephew Ernest (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his wife, native Osage Mollie (Lily Gladstone). Jesse Plemons, Brendan Fraser, and John Lithgow also star in the film, which was directed by Scorsese based off a script he wrote with Eric Roth.Scorsese’s first project since his 2019 Best Picture nominee “The Irishman,” “Killers of the Flower Moon” made its world premiere out of competition at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival in May. There, it was immediately received with rapturous acclaim, with critics particularly praising Scorsese’s direction and Gladstone’s performance.In his review out of the festival, IndieWire Chief Film Critic David Ehrlich wrote that “Scorsese turns ‘Killers of the Flower Moon’ into the kind of story that he can still tell better than anyone else: A story about greed, corruption, and the mottled soul of a country that was born from the belief that it belonged to anyone callous enough to take it.”“Killers of the Flower Moon” will premiere in select theaters on October 6, followed by a wide release on October 20. The film will stream globally on Apple TV+ from a yet-to-be-announced date. Following the release of the film, Scorsese and DiCaprio will re-team with Apple for an adaptation of Grann’s latest nonfiction work, shipwreck survival story “The Wager.”",

        "content": "Since its release in 2004, Edgar Wright‘s “Shaun of the Dead” has grown to become one of the century’s most beloved comedy films. But as popular a touchstone as the film remains, co-writer and star Simon Pegg has made it clear that a sequel to the zombie rom-com isn’t on his to-do list in the future.“If I ever do an Instagram Live or whatever, people are always like, ‘I need ‘Shaun of the Dead 2’ in my life,’” Pegg said in a recent interview with The Guardian. “And I’m like, ‘No, you don’t fucking need ‘Shaun of the Dead 2!’ The last thing you need is ‘Shaun of the Dead 2!’ It’s done. Move on!’”The original “Shaun of the Dead” starred Pegg as the titular Shaun, a slacker salesman who gets dumped by his girlfriend right before the onslaught of a zombie apocalypse. The film was a sleeper success upon release, grossing $30 million worldwide on a $6 million budget. Although a sequel was never officially made, it did form the first in what became an unofficial trilogy of films directed by Wright and starring Pegg and Nick Frost. The other two in the “Three Flavours Cornetto” trilogy, “Hot Fuzz” and “The World’s End,” were released in 2007 and 2013, respectively.Pegg, who was interviewed by The Guardian to promote his upcoming role in “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” further revealed that he and Wright spent a week last summer brainstorming working on a fourth feature film together. Pegg admitted that progress on creating a fourth film was “slow,” although he claimed it was because Wright’s dog was a distraction, but said they came up with a few ideas. Pegg didn’t reveal further details of their plans, but said the film won’t be a followup to the Three Falvours films, and will be very different from those three genre parody films.“Whatever Edgar and I do next, we’re not going to rely on what we’ve done before,” Pegg told The Guardian. “I like the idea of pissing people off. There’s something fun about torching everything. Everything that people think we are, that’s what we won’t be. We should just do something that no one’s expecting.” Pegg laughs, “But no one wants!”Since “The World’s End,” the pair — who also created the TV series “Spaced” together — have yet to make another film together. Wright has since directed “Baby Driver” and “Last Night at SoHo.” Pegg has acted in several films, most prominently the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, which he joined with the fourth installment “Ghost Protocol.” “Dead Reckoning Part One” — starring series lead Tom Cruise along with Hayley Atwell, Esai Morales, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Vanessa Kirby, Henry Czerny, and Pom Klementieff — releases in theaters July 12. “Part Two,” which is billed as the last film in the franchise, releases June 28, 2024.",

        "content": "In the trailer for Greta Gerwig‘s highly anticipated “Barbie” film adaptation, one of the biggest plot points is the central Barbie doll (played by Margot Robbie) suddenly losing her trademark arched feet, to the horror of the other Barbies in Barbie Land. But that moment almost became horrifying for completely different reasons, as the executives in charge of the film nearly considered using CGI on the actors’ feet — before Gerwig quickly squashed the idea.Gerwig spoke about making the film during an interview on the Australian talk show “The Project” (via Variety). During the interview, she spoke about how she made the arched foot scene that opens the trailer happen, revealing that she shut down discussions of using CGI on Robbie or the rest of the actors playing Barbie early on.“There was a big discussion in the beginning,” Gerwig said the show. “Everyone said, ‘Are you going to CGI all the feet?’ And I thought, ‘Oh god, no! That’s terrifying! That’s a nightmare.’ Also Margot has the nicest feet. She has these beautiful dancer feet. She should just hang on to that bar and do it just like this.”In the end, Robbie ended up arching her feet by herself; according to a Time Magazine story, the shot took eight tries, and Robbie ended up holding a bar off camera in order to stay stable while walking.As for why Gerwig wanted the arched feet in the movie, the director said it was part of her attempt to recapture the experience of playing with Barbie dolls when she was a kid.“Even though it’s this huge movie, it feels very personal to me,” Gerwig said. “It was made by so many people who cared about it. Even the Barbie logo that we used is the logo that I had as a child of the ’80s. I would stand in the toy store…we had the wide boxes because their hair was really big. I wanted the [logo] that I liked.”“Barbie” releases July 21. Gerwig directs from a script she co-wrote with her partner Noah Baumbach, and Robbie stars alongside Ryan Gosling as Ken. Additional cast members in the ensemble include Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Hari Nef, Dua Lipa, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Simu Liu, Ncuti Gatwa, John Cena, Michael Cera, Emerald Fennell, America Ferrera, Will Ferrell, Rhea Perlman, and Helen Mirren as the narrator.

        "content": "This December, Netflix will release their second original film from Zack Snyder, space opera “Rebel Moon.” But the movie almost had a very different fate — it began life as an idea from the director for a new “Star Wars” film, which he pitched to Lucasfilm shortly after the sale of the company to Disney in 2012. And according to Snyder, that pitch was a bit of a non-starter, in part due to his insistence that the film should be R-Rated.In an interview with Empire Magazine, Snyder reminisced about pitching a new “Star Wars” film to Lucasfilm, saying that he made the pitch because ““There was that window where, you know, who knows what’s possible?” However, he said the pitch failed to get off the ground due to his requirements for the film, which included focusing on a completely new set of characters and going for a mature, R-rated tone.I was like, ‘I don’t want any of your characters. I don’t want to do anything with any known characters, I just want to do my own thing on the side,'” Snyder told Empire. “And originally I was like, ‘It should be rated R!’ That was almost a non-starter.”After the pitch didn’t go anywhere, Snyder — then best known for “Dawn of the Dead,” “300,” and “Watchmen” — joined Warner Bros. to help establish the “DC Extended Universe,” by directing Superman film “Man of Steel” and “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.” He left production on “Justice League” following the death of his teenage daughter, but later returned to the film for his “Snyder Cut” version. Following leaving DC, he directed “Army of the Dead” for Netflix, and eventually redeveloped his “Star Wars” pitch into what became “Rebel Moon.”“I knew it was a big ask, to be honest,” Snyder said about the initial “Star Wars” pitch. “But the deeper I got into it, I realised it was probably never going to be what I wanted.” He ended up getting what he wanted with “Rebel Moon,” albeit with some compromise; the film will initially be released with a PG-13 rated cut onto Netflix, with an extended R-rated version of the film coming to the platform later on.Snyder directs “Rebel Moon” from a script he cowrote with Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten. The film — which features an ensemble cast including Sofia Boutella, Charlie Hunnam, Michiel Huisman, Djimon Hounsou, Doona Bae, Ray Fisher, Cleopatra Coleman, Jena Malone, Fra Fee, Ed Skrein, and Anthony Hopkins — will release on Netflix December 22, and will also receive a limited theatrical release. A second film, “Rebel Moon Part 2,” was shot back-to-back with the original; a release date has yet to be announced for the follow-up.",

        "title": "Daniel Radcliffe on Returning for ‘Harry Potter’ TV Series: ‘I’m Definitely Not Seeking It Out’",
        "content": "Daniel Radcliffe isn’t eager to step back into the Wizarding World. In a recent interview, the actor said he isn’t “seeking” a cameo appearance in the upcoming TV show reboot of the “Harry Potter” franchise.First announced in April, the upcoming “Harry Potter” series for Warner Bros. Discovery’s Max streamer will adapt all seven books in J.K. Rowling’s popular series of children’s fantasy novels. The series will be the second screen adaptation of the popular books, following the Warner Bros.’ original “Harry Potter” film series, which shot Radcliffe to international fame when he was only 11 years old.In an interview with Comic Book.com published Monday, Radcliffe said he understands the new adaptation will be their own interpretation, and that he believes his presence will be a distraction from the new actor playing the title character.“My understanding is that they’re trying to very much start fresh and I’m sure whoever is making them will want to make their own mark on it and probably not want to have to figure out how to get old Harry to cameo in this somewhere,” Radcliffe told Comic Book.com in an interview published Monday. “So I’m definitely not seeking it out in any way. But I do wish them, obviously, all the luck in the world and I’m very excited to have that torch passed. But I don’t think it needs me to physically pass it.”Since ending his time as the boy wizard with the eighth and final “Harry Potter” film in 2011 when he was 22 years old, Radcliffe has largely veered away from franchises or blockbuster film work, in favor of comedy films like “Swiss Army Man,” “The Lost City,” and “Weird: the Al Yankovic Story,” or theater roles. In recent years, he’s also spoken out against Rowling’s controversial transphobic views, which the author has been outspoken about since 2020. Shortly after Rowling made her views public, Radcliffe published an open letter to the Trevor Project’s website expressing his support towards the Trans community.“The reason I was felt very, very much as though I needed to say something when I did was because, particularly since finishing ‘Potter,’ I’ve met so many queer and trans kids and young people who had a huge amount of identification with Potter on that,” Radcliffe told IndieWire during an interview last year. “And so seeing them hurt on that day I was like, I wanted them to know that not everybody in the franchise felt that way. And that was really important.”Currently, Radcliffe is starring in the fourth and final season of “Miracle Workers,” a comedic anthology series created by Simon Rich. The fourth season — which also stars Geraldine Viswanathan, Karan Soni, Jon Bass, and Steve Buscemi — premieres July 10 on TBS. This fall, the actor will also appear on Broadway in a revival of the Stephen Sondheim musical “Merrily We Roll Along,” starring opposite Jonathan Groff and Lindsay Mendez.",

        "title": "Rock Hudson Was a Great Actor, but the New Doc on His Life Fails to Celebrate His Artistry",
        "content": "The most important thing about “Rock Hudson: All That Heaven Allowed” is that, within the essential act of reclamation it provides for the star, it doesn’t just write off the Hollywood icon’s life as sad. That’s a remarkable thing for a documentary in which its last 40 minutes are as harrowing a depiction of AIDS in the ’80s there’s been in a film since “How to Survive a Plague.”Certainly, it’s infuriating and upsetting on many levels: that Hudson wasn’t allowed to fly on a commercial airliner because of his diagnosis and had to rent an Air France Boeing 747 at the cost of $250,000 to return home to Los Angeles from Paris as it became clear his experimental treatment there had failed. And the revelation that his friend Nancy Reagan even urged her husband to deny him treatment at a military hospital is beyond enraging.Stephen Kijak’s documentary does an illuminating job, however, of suggesting that Hudson lived, for the most part, a happy life. Being closeted to the general public did not mean that he was not out to a large group of people — he certainly expressed his sexuality, and with many partners, some of whom appear in Kijak’s film to share their memories of him.Often in cinematic depictions, gay men have not been allowed to be sexual, and the frank descriptions of his liaisons with numerous men (during one segment, Hudson is heard setting up himself over the phone in his Grand Canyon-majestic voice conveying explicit detail) speak to the degree to which he really was liberated. Doris Day may not have known he was gay, but many, many others in his orbit did.Kijak even goes so far as to imply that there have been few Hollywood celebrity deaths ever to have more meaning than Hudson’s, in the way it helped to normalize homosexuality and being HIV positive and spur action to improve the survival rate. To the homophobic public, if Rock Hudson, the ultimate example of movie god Americana, could be these things, so could anyone.Where Kijak’s film falls short is in its consideration of Hudson as an actor. Allison Anders praises his performance in “Giant,” but there’s little consideration of what a precise, methodical performer he was. It’s a shame because the documentary would have been a natural place to do that, and it’s hard to imagine any other documentary on the horizon that would.Even at the time of his greatest success in the late ’50s, Hudson’s acting gifts weren’t celebrated in the way they could have been. He was cool and reserved, inherently embracing the idea that navigating American life is all about the wearing and swapping out of masks.He’s the actor who comes the closest to embodying the idea of Don Draper. What, I’m comparing him to Jon Hamm’s aggressively hetero “Mad Men” character? Yes, because that character was all about wearing masks, having invented his persona from the ground up, literally assuming someone else’s identity. There’s an element of self-invention that’s always essential to the idea of the midcentury American dream: You were simply who you said you were. Jay Gatsby was that on the page. Rock Hudson lived it.Hudson was that in every sense. Not just because he was gay and projected an image of straightness, but in all the other ways his persona was manufactured. There’s a legend, possibly untrue, that he developed his mellifluous voice by screaming at the top of his lungs on a mountaintop while suffering from a head cold, breaking a vocal chord so that it artificially lowered his voice for the rest of his life. What a mad, mythic story. It’s not presented in the doc, again probably because it isn’t true, but it’s reflective of the unique place Hudson occupied between legend and reality.In so many of his films, Hudson’s characters are navigating reality by projecting their own image of reality. There’s as much role-swapping, misdirection, and mistaken identities in “Pillow Talk” or “Lover Come Back” as in a Shakespeare play. “Magnificent Obsession” is all about him becoming a better person by being increasingly inauthentic; his authentic self is an asshole. His mysterious tree farmer in “All That Heaven Allows,” not at all an unambiguously noble hunk, seems committed to exchanging one cage for Jane Wyman’s character for another.Issues of authenticity are at the core of Hudson’s roles in a way that speaks deeply to the American character. But he was cool and reserved where James Dean and Marlon Brando and Paul Newman burned hot. A twinkle in his eye and a wry smile as Brad Allen in “Pillow Talk” convey an internal life you have to work a bit to access — you come to him, not him to you, as he’s always going to withhold himself a bit. The Method guys? They’re all on the surface, their inner lives made external through eruptions of emotion. One of these styles of acting was thought to be “acting,” the other merely stardom.That narrative has remained largely unchanged since the ’50s. Kijak’s film suggests that the flirtations with homosexuality in “Pillow Talk” and “Lover Come Back” was producer Ross Hunter making fun of Hudson being closeted (though the incessant use of clips from his movies to imply gay undertones, which most audiences wouldn’t have detected at the time, seems almost like Kijak doing the same). But look at Hudson’s comic timing in those movies. Look at the very self-aware (and contemporary) way he projects toxic masculinity in those films. It’s performance and critique at the same time. Dean and Brando delivered rawness; Hudson delivered irony.For me, the ultimate example of an actor’s greatness is when he or she can elevate an otherwise bad movie. Look no further than Hudson in “The Mirror Crack’d,” a film entirely omitted from the documentary. This Agatha Christie adaptation is bad. Even Angela Lansbury (as Miss Marple) is bad in it, which almost never happened. Elizabeth Taylor turns in a forgettable performance. But… Hudson is electrifying. Yes, once again he’s a man with a secret. And he almost single-handedly elevates that movie to something grand and tragic, acting circles around his dear friend Taylor. He was a serious artist capable of delivering serious art even when serious art was very much not expected.That Hudson is missing from “All That Heaven Allowed.” I wish it had been there. Luckily, Hudson’s films are still there to be discovered and enjoyed anew. Watch them for what’s there, not what you think is there.",

        "content": "Ezra Miller is addressing the multiple abuse claims against them.The “Flash” actor, who identifies as non-binary and uses they/them pronouns, took to Instagram to react to the lifting of a temporary harassment order in the Massachusetts Greenfield District Court. Miller was accused of abusing a then-12-year-old non-binary child; the harassment order was filed by Shannon Guin in June 2022, but no criminal charges were filed against Miller.“I’m encouraged by today’s outcome and very grateful at this moment to everyone who has stood beside me and sought to ensure that this egregious misuse of the protective order system was halted,” Miller wrote in response to the harassment order being lifted. “I have been unjustly and directly targeted by an individual who the facts have shown has a history of such manipulative and destructive action.”Miller continued, “Protective orders are meant to provide safety for individuals, families, and children who are in danger. They are not meant to be used as weapons by those seeking attention or fleeting tabloid fame or some sort of personal vengeance when there are people in true and dire need of these services.”The star added, “I implore those members of the media who have recklessly spread false claims and failed to accurately report the truth and context of this story to hold themselves to a higher standard and take time to find the facts, rather than chasing the clicks.”Miller shared they are doing their “best” to “preserve their own wellness” while working to “reverse the collateral damage” of the accusations.Miller’s lawyer, Marissa Elkins, additionally shared a statement.“Frustratingly for Ezra, Guin lodged her false allegations at a time when Ezra was struggling with significant mental health issues, and was unable to come to court to defend themself against the spurious claims made by this individual,” Elkins wrote. “Had Ezra been able to appear in court last year and share the truth about their very limited interactions with Ms. Guin, I am confident the original order would have never been issued.”A similar harassment order against Miller was filed by the parents of non-binary teen Tokata Iron Eyes in North Dakota. The parents later withdrew the request and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Court dismissed the harassment order.Amid the numerous allegations against Miller, Warner Bros. Discovery stood by the DCU star. “The Flash” release date was never going to be derailed, according to director Andy Muschietti, and Miller will not be recast in an impending sequel.Miller issued an apology statement in 2022 and announced they were seeking mental health treatment. The actor later thanked the Warner Bros. Discovery team for treating them with “grace” during the past two years, specifically crediting the “dynamic duo” DC co-CEOs Peter Safran and James Gunn “for your grace and discernment and care in the context of my life and bringing this moment of action to fruition.”",

        "title": "Stanley Tucci Stands by Playing Queer Roles as a Straight Actor: It’s Done ‘the Right Way’",
        "content": "Stanley Tucci is addressing the ongoing debate over straight actors playing queer characters.Tucci, who famously starred as a gay fashion editor in “The Devil Wears Prada,” opened up about the legacy of the role during the 17th anniversary of the film.“Obviously I believe that’s fine,” Tucci said during BBC Radio 4’s “Desert Island Discs” show about playing queer characters. “I am always very flattered when gay men come up to me and talk to me about ‘The Devil Wears Prada’ or they talk about ‘Supernova,’ and they say that, ‘It was just so beautiful,’ you know, ‘You did it the right way.’ Because often, it’s not done the right way.”Tucci also played a gay character in 2020 film “Supernova.” He is married to Emily Blunt’s sister, whom he met during “The Devil Wears Prada.”“An actor is an actor is an actor,” Tucci continued. “You’re supposed to play different people. You just are. That’s the whole point of it.”Tom Hanks, who won an Oscar for playing a gay man with AIDS in 1993’s “Philadelphia,” told The New York Times Magazine last year that he would not star in a queer storyline today.“Let’s address ‘could a straight man do what I did in “Philadelphia” now?’ No, and rightly so,” Hanks said at the time. “The whole point of ‘Philadelphia’ was don’t be afraid. One of the reasons people weren’t afraid of that movie is that I was playing a gay man. We’re beyond that now, and I don’t think people would accept the inauthenticity of a straight guy playing a gay guy.”He added, “It’s not a crime, it’s not boohoo, that someone would say we are going to demand more of a movie in the modern realm of authenticity.”In contrast, Zachary Quinto called out the assumption that queer actors cannot authentically portray straight characters.“There’s still a tremendous amount of fear around particularly openly gay men in our industry,” Quinto said. “There is this long-held and stubborn belief that to identify as an openly gay man on some level means you’re inherently less masculine, inherently less believable as a straight character.”Quinto added earlier, “You look at how many straight actors play gay roles, and how that door doesn’t swing the other way as much…There’s a lot of controversy surrounding people playing roles that are actually in line with who they are authentically. It’s an interesting time, right? Part of the nature of being an actor is to step outside of ourselves and have experiences that aren’t in line with who we are. But the political climate, and the race for equality, has kind of shifted the ground around that notion and I think we have to be patient and see how things settle.”",

        "content": "Barbie Land just got a little smaller.The highly-anticipated “Barbie” has been banned in Vietnam over the inclusion of the “nine dash line map” depicting islands in the South China Sea as being controlled by Beijing. Vietnamese politicians claim the map violates its sovereignty.Vi Kien Thanh, director general of the Vietnam Cinema Department under the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism, announced that “Barbie” will not be allowed to commercially screen in the nation, as decided by the National Film Evaluation Council.“We do not grant license for the American movie ‘Barbie’ to release in Vietnam because it contains the offending image of the nine-dash line,” the state-run Tuoi Tre newspaper stated, citing Thanh (via Variety).Previous films “Uncharted” and “Abominable” were similarly banned in Vietnam for the same cause, as well as series “Madam Secretary,” “Pine Gap,” and “Put Your Head On My Shoulder.”The United Nations ruled unanimously against the validity of the “nine dash line” map in 2016, but China has stated it does not recognize the U.N.’s decision.“Barbie” lead star and producer Margot Robbie previously shared that upon first reading director Gerwig’s script for the live-action Mattel film, she was shocked it could even get made.“The first time I read the ‘Barbie’ script, my reaction was, ‘Ah! This is so good. What a shame it will never see the light of day,'” Robbie said earlier this year, “‘because they are never going to let us make this movie.’ But they did.”Screenwriter Gerwig admitted it felt like “vertigo” to pen the movie alongside collaborator Noah Baumbach. “Where do you even begin? What would be the story?” Gerwig recalled wondering. “I think it was that feeling I had that it would be really interesting terror. Usually, that’s where the best stuff is. When you’re like, ‘I am terrified of that.’ Anything where you’re like, ‘This could be a career-ender,’ then you’re like, ‘OK, I probably should do it.'”For all the details on “Barbie,” click here.",

        "content": "Daniel Kaluuya is taking Barney to the next level.The Oscar winner is set to star in and produce an upcoming live-action film adaptation of the children’s TV show. However, there’s a tonal twist to the project, as teased by Mattel Films executive Kevin McKeon.“We’re leaning into the millennial angst of the property rather than fine-tuning this for kids. It’s really a play for adults,” McKeon told The New Yorker. “Not that it’s R-rated, but it’ll focus on some of the trials and tribulations of being thirtysomething, growing up with Barney — just the level of disenchantment within the generation.”McKeon described the film as an “A24-type” “surrealistic” story akin to Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze’s respective works. “It would be so daring of us,” McKeon said, “and really underscore that we’re here to make art.”Lead star Kaluuya previously told Entertainment Weekly in 2020 that he wanted to focus on the “heartbreaking” aspects of Barney.“Barney taught us, ‘I love you, you love me. Won’t you say you love me too?’ That’s one of the first songs I remember, and what happens when that isn’t true?” Kaluuya said. “I thought that was really heartbreaking. I have no idea why but it feels like that makes sense. It feels like there’s something unexpected that can be poignant but optimistic. Especially at this time now, I think that’s really, really needed.”Mattel Films is launching tentpole feature “Barbie” this summer, which features references to “2001: A Space Odyssey,” “The Matrix,” and more classic films. As the trailer captures, Barbie (Margot Robbie) has an existential crisis which forces her to enter the real world and leave Barbieland in a reverse Genesis storyline.

        "title": "The Best DVD Commentaries on Filmmaking",
        "content": "“You’re listening to a guy who learned a lot about ripping off movies from watching laserdiscs with director commentary,” says Paul Thomas Anderson at the beginning of his “Boogie Nights” DVD commentary, acknowledging something many of us learned in the early days of the Criterion Collection back in the late 1980s and early ‘90s: Listening to filmmakers talk about craft as their movie unspools is one of the best ways to start thinking like a filmmaker.Of course, not all commentaries are created equal, and for every P.T. Anderson or Martin Scorsese who is great at articulating their process, there are dozens of directors who fall back on the “so and so was great to work with” style of narration or merely describe the onscreen action. In the interest of saving you the time and aggravation that come with wasting hours on unworthy tracks, here are 25 of the best DVD commentaries from which to learn about filmmaking. With the exception of Steven Soderbergh (who is represented here multiple times thanks to his willingness to appear on other directors’ commentaries as an interviewer) and Peter Bogdanovich (who also appears on a commentary for a film not his own), I’ve limited each filmmaker to one appearance on the list — but since most people are either good at commentaries or not, you can assume that if someone is on this list, all of their DVDs are worth checking out. “Taxi Driver” (Sony) In 1990, Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader recorded the gold standard for commentary tracks, a shot-by-shot visual and thematic breakdown of their work on “Taxi Driver” for the Criterion laserdisc release. That laserdisc is long out of print, but the commentary is available on several of Sony’s DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K releases of the film, and it remains one of the best ways to start thinking like a filmmaker. The “Taxi Driver” commentary was just the beginning for Scorsese and Schrader, who together have recorded dozens of others, both for their own films and, in the case of Scorsese, for movies they love. (Scorsese’s commentary on the Criterion edition of Michael Powell’s “The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp” is an indispensable delight.) Taken together, the collected commentaries of Scorsese and Schrader serve as a viable alternative to film school, one as entertaining as it is informative.“The Graduate” (Criterion) If you want to learn how to think about finding visual and aural corollaries for a script’s themes and emotions, UCLA film professor Howard Suber’s audio commentary for this 1967 landmark is a fantastic place to begin. His narration skillfully dissects how director Mike Nichols and his team use decor, lenses, light, costumes and more to convey the title character’s state of mind in every scene; the relationship of those scenes to each other is also brilliantly explored in Suber’s razor-sharp analysis of the underlying screenplay’s structure. The Criterion disc features a second commentary by Nichols in conversation with Steven Soderbergh, who does a terrific job of extracting useful information from the director on his guiding principles and influences (from “Persona” to “A Place in the Sun”) and how he applied them. In terms of the amount of useful information per minute, these two commentaries are tough to beat.  “Boogie Nights” (New Line) Paul Thomas Anderson stopped recording commentary tracks after the two he laid down for this, his second feature, and it’s a shame because few directors are as infectiously enthusiastic and inspiring when talking about their work. Anderson’s solo commentary is jammed to the hilt with revealing insights into his thought process, while a second commentary in which he riffs on the movie with various cast members is hilarious, candid, and gives a great indication of the kind of environment Anderson created on set to facilitate the greatest ensemble acting in the history of American film. “Following” (Criterion) Christopher Nolan had no money with which to make his 1999 debut feature, but he used the resources he did have — time, talent, and creative freedom — brilliantly, creating a riveting contemporary noir that introduces several of the themes and techniques that would characterize later Nolan films like “Memento” and “Inception.” His DVD commentary focuses specifically on how he overcame his limitations by doing things like blocking the action near windows (to save on lighting), staging conversations on rooftops (to get urban exteriors without permits or sound problems), and rehearsing for six months so that the actors could get in and out of stolen locations quickly with one or two takes.  “Citizen Kane” (Criterion) Orson Welles’ debut film is still the textbook when it comes to learning visual storytelling, and it’s rich enough to easily justify the three commentary tracks on this disc — all of them loaded with perceptive analyses of Welles’ techniques. Filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich, critic Roger Ebert, and Welles scholars James Naremore and Jonathan Rosenbaum provide six hours of material on how and why Welles did what he did and what it means both for “Citizen Kane” and film history as a whole, and there isn’t a wasted or dull minute to be found. If you’re a newcomer to Welles, this disc provides a fantastic crash course. If you’re a Welles fanatic, Naremore and Rosenbaum’s observations in particular will inspire you to look at the director in general and this film in particular in a new way. “The Counselor” (Fox) Ridley Scott’s best movie (sorry, “Blade Runner!”) also has his best commentary track, though this is much more than a typical audio commentary. The narration is interspersed with video featurettes that interrupt the movie at various points to take the viewer deep inside the making of the film, creating a 186-minute viewing experience that scrutinizes Scott’s filmmaking process from every possible angle. Scott’s commentary and the accompanying featurettes are filled with astonishing revelations — most notably that this film set in the American southwest was shot entirely in Spain and London for tax purposes (the fact that it’s utterly convincing is a testament to the genius of Scott and his crew) — and Scott’s justified enthusiasm for the film is as engaging as his insights are vital.   “Pan’s Labyrinth” (Criterion) This is a typically enthusiastic track from director Guillermo Del Toro, who is thankfully as knowledgeable as he is passionate and as generous with that knowledge as any director this side of Scorsese. His narration takes the viewer through every step of his filmmaking process from conception and structure to influences and visual design, and he’s especially adept at illustrating how all of these elements relate to the themes of his story. Del Toro is as entertaining a verbal storyteller as he is a visual one, which is really saying something — and which makes this commentary 110 minutes of pure pleasure. “Grace of My Heart” (Scorpion) Allison Anders’ 1996 musical represented a huge leap in ambition and scale for the writer-director following her earlier, exquisitely crafted character studies (“Gas Food Lodging,” “Mi Vida Loca”), but her sensibility survived the transition from independent film to the studio system and yielded one of the great American films of the decade. It wasn’t easy though, and on this commentary track, Anders talks about the many challenges of trying to mount a pop epic on what was, relative to what she was trying to achieve, a modest budget. There’s a lot of gold here on topics like the complex process of creating the film’s songs, working with actors to create depth in limited spaces, recreating 1960s New York in Los Angeles, getting producer Martin Scorsese to shoot inserts, and much more.“Out of Sight” (Kino Lorber Studio Classics)  Asking a commentary enthusiast to choose their favorite Steven Soderbergh disc is a little like asking a parent to choose their favorite child, but it’s hard to do better than this articulate and witty track shared with screenwriter Scott Frank on the movie that moved Soderbergh from the margins to the center of film culture. “Out of Sight” is a kind of movie miracle, an alchemic blend of the right people at the right time that produced a dazzling mix of romantic comedy and crime caper that’s both highly idiosyncratic and smoothly accessible. Soderbergh’s description of how he threaded the film’s challenging tonal needles in a way that made the movie look effortless — at the very moment when the director was under the most self-imposed pressure of his career — is fascinating, and the abundance of great production stories make this a commentary worth returning to again and again.   “Love & Basketball” (Criterion) Gina Prince-Bythewood’s 2000 debut is both a poignant, complex love story and a powerhouse sports movie with some of the most expertly staged basketball scenes ever put on film (no coincidence given that the story had its roots in Prince-Bythewood’s own past as an athlete). On a pair of excellent commentaries, one alongside star Sanaa Lathan and the other shared with editor Terilyn A. Shropshire and composer Terence Blanchard, Prince-Bythewood communicates not only the fundamentals of shooting a great sports sequence but the delicate tonal balance her movie required, and how she solved the problems it raised both on the set and in the editing room.   “Se7en” (New Line) This disc contains four commentary tracks for the price of one, and each of them is expertly assembled and illuminating. The commentators dissect the film from a variety of perspectives: Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman take a deep dive into the acting on one track, screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker and others explore the story on another, and additional commentaries provide insights into the creation of the visual style and sound design. Director David Fincher appears on all four tracks alongside his collaborators and articulates his intentions with wit and clarity, giving the listener a crash course in the creation of a suspense classic from conception to test screening.“Valley Girl” (Shout! Factory) In 1983, Martha Coolidge shot a teen comedy classic with a $350,000 budget and a 20-day shooting schedule; on this disc, she explains how. Coolidge fills her commentary with great stories about how fulfilling her financiers’ requirements without compromising her own intentions, clearly and concisely breaks down her approach to color and costumes, and offers tips on how to elicit great performances from your actors when you’ve got no time. The commentary is smart, funny, and warm, just like the movie and the director who made it. “JFK” (Warner)  Oliver Stone talks for a solid three hours on this commentary and fills every minute with compelling insights into his tactics as both writer and director on what was, in 1991, the most ambitious and audacious film of his career. Stone is so transparent about his motivations and so detailed in his descriptions of them that this is a great commentary track even if you’re one of the film’s detractors; for its admirers, this is a riveting analysis of how a modern American epic came to be, conveyed with a clarity that makes its lessons applicable even to much more modest productions.     “Menace II Society” (Criterion) The Hughes Brothers’ searing 1993 crime film was one of the most assured directorial debuts of its decade, and it hasn’t lost any of its power in the 30 years since its release. The robust, confident filmmaking style of twin brothers Albert and Allen, who were only 21 years old when “Menace” came out, is broken down element by element on a pair of excellent audio commentaries: Allen focuses largely on the performances, story, and sound design, while Albert weighs in on the camerawork and editing. Both brothers are extremely clear about the choices they made and why they made them, resulting in a clinic in visual storytelling that’s aided by a third supplementary feature, a selected-scene commentary by cinematographer Lisa Rinzler. “True Romance” (Arrow). Quentin Tarantino doesn’t contribute audio commentaries to the movies he directs, but he recorded one for “True Romance,” in which his sensibility as a screenwriter is filtered through the spectacular eye of director Tony Scott. It’s a great commentary too, exuberant and inspiring and exhaustive in its history of the script and movie’s evolution. Scott gets his own commentary track as well, as do stars Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater, but the jewel of Arrow’s special edition is a fourth commentary by novelist and film critic Tim Lucas that adroitly delineates the ways in which the intersection (collision?) between Tarantino and Scott’s voices resulted in a film that Lucas convincingly claims planted the seeds for much of what was to follow in American cinema for the next 20 years.       “High and Low” (Criterion)  Akira Kurosawa is no longer with us to share his process, but he has a worthy advocate and proxy in the form of film scholar Stephen Prince, who has recorded commentaries for several Kurosawa classics and brilliantly breaks down the components of Kurosawa’s filmmaking style in each one. This epic thriller is one of the best examples of Kurosawa’s genius when it comes to widescreen framing, and Prince delineates exactly how and why the director made the choices that he did, explaining where Kurosawa positioned his multiple cameras and which lenses he used to achieve his effects. Prince is also very good at analyzing Kurosawa’s editing and demonstrating why the length of his shots is so appropriate for the visceral impact he’s trying to achieve.  “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (Sony)  Francis Ford Coppola’s visually sumptuous and thoroughly original cinematic take on the classic novel is a treasure trove of cinematic tricks, and Coppola and collaborators Roman Coppola (who directed the second unit and created many of the film’s most inventive special effects) and Greg Cannom (who created Gary Oldman’s Oscar-winning makeup) explain how they did all of them in an instructive and lively commentary. The disc also features an additional solo commentary by Coppola that’s great for inspiring outside-the-box thinking, as the director talks about creating the production design through costumes rather than sets, utilizing optical techniques from the silent era and German expressionism rather than modern visual effects, and consulting with a magician and gymnasts about how to capture as much of the surreal action as possible in-camera. “The Piano” (Criterion)  In telling a story with a woman who doesn’t speak at its center, writer-director Jane Campion emphasized all of filmmaking’s non-verbal components — particularly light, color, and music — and created a gorgeous and immersive classic in the process. On the DVD commentary, Campion and producer Jan Chapman delve into every aspect of the production, from casting and logistical challenges to using composition, lenses, and music to find visual and aural corollaries for the ideas in the script. Campion and Chapman are particularly instructive on the topic of actors, as they explore working with child performers and how to reconcile their lack of experience with that of the veterans. “He Said, She Said” (Paramount)  This inventive 1991 rom-com presents its story twice, with the half told from Kevin Bacon’s perspective directed by Ken Kwapis and the half told from Elizabeth Perkins’ vantage point helmed by Marisa Silver. (The movie ends with a final act that’s a sort of “they said” to wrap things up.) The result is a unique opportunity to explore how camera position, lenses, and editing can be used to express point of view, and the commentary track by Kwapis, Silver, screenwriter Brian Hohlfeld, and cinematographer Stephen Burum does a nice job of outlining the differences, both subtle and obvious, between the film’s two primary sections. There’s also some great material here on framing and why shooting in Cinemascope is the right choice for an intimate romance, how lighting can be used to make the audience fall in love with or turn against a character, and the calculus behind planning versus spontaneity on set.“Harlan County, USA” (Criterion) The challenges and pleasures of documentary filmmaking are vividly illustrated by director Barbara Kopple and editor Nancy Baker on this track, which delves into both technical matters and the question of how documentarians earn the trust of their subjects. Kopple and Baker are particularly attentive to issues relating to music and sound and provide useful insights into how they structured their material to balance the story’s personal, political, and historical components. Kopple is open about the pressures she was under and the immense struggles when it came to financing, but she’s equally transparent about the deep and profound joy that making the movie gave her — especially when it ultimately found the audience that it deserved. The upshot is a commentary as stirring and straightforward as the film it accompanies. “Hostel: Part II” (Sony)  The greatest American horror film of the 2000s yields a spirited commentary track from writer-director Eli Roth, who breaks down the ways in which he applied influences both expected (Italian giallo cinema) and surprising (the “Harry Potter” franchise!), explains how practical effects and CG are best combined, and lays out how to structure suspense both on the page and in the visual style for maximum impact. On a second audio track, Roth is joined by executive producer Quentin Tarantino and second unit director Gabriel Roth, who supply even more fascinating details about the making of the film and background on many of the other participants, and a third commentary provides the actors’ perspective courtesy of Lauren Germain, Vera Jordanova, and Richard Burgi. In addition to the wealth of filmmaking material here, Roth delves into the implications of making a film about capitalism and torture post-9/11, providing great food for thought on the topic of smuggling one’s personal preoccupations — political and otherwise — into the framework of a down and dirty genre film.    “The Lone Gunmen: The Complete Series” (Fox)  This “X-Files” spin-off was one of the most criminally underseen and short-lived series ever to grace the airwaves, with some heavyweight filmmaking talent behind the camera: One of its creators was “Breaking Bad” and “Better Call Saul” maestro Vince Gilligan; the visual style was established in the pilot by “Game of Thrones” and “Ray Donovan” cinematographer Robert McLachlan; and almost half the episodes were directed by Bryan Spicer, one of the most dynamic helmers in episodic TV. All three, along with several other collaborators, are featured in multiple commentaries that are must-listens for anyone interested in creating great art within the network television system; though the show is over 20 years old, its lessons are evergreen.“The Yards” (Imprint)  Another disc that gives you two commentaries for the price of one, both fantastic. On one track, director James Gray talks with Steven Soderbergh, who’s every bit as good at drawing out insights into Gray’s process as he was Mike Nichols’ on the “Graduate” commentary, and on the other, Gray provides a solo narration in which he drills down into his choices in more detail. Both commentaries are excellent considerations of the endlessly challenging intersection between aesthetic and practical considerations that must be properly calibrated every day on a film set. “The Verdict” (Fox)  This 1982 courtroom drama from director Sidney Lumet and screenwriter David Mamet is one of the great character studies of its era, a profound and moving story of a con man’s redemption that earns every one of its emotionally powerful moments. Lumet’s audio commentary describes both the creation of Paul Newman’s complex character and Lumet’s way of using all the visual tools at his disposal to externalize his protagonist’s internal pressures. From controlling the color palette by using autumnal colors (to convey the sense of a man living in the past) to surrounding the character with majestic architecture to show what he’s up against and casting supporting actors whose inherent truthfulness would stand in stark relief to Newman’s character’s dishonesty, Lumet’s choices in “The Verdict” are unerring, and he expounds upon all of them on this disc.“Targets” (Criterion) Peter Bogdanovich’s 1968 debut is a lesson in bending a financier’s orders to one’s own ends, as he took a series of random instructions from producer Roger Corman (shoot two days with Boris Karloff, use 20 minutes of footage from another Karloff film Corman owned, etc.) and managed to execute them while figuring out how to benefit from his limited resources. Bogdanovich’s commentary track is a treasure trove of lessons on how to shoot both artistically and economically, with particular emphasis on what he learned from veteran directors like George Cukor, Samuel Fuller, and Alfred Hitchcock, whom he met during his apprenticeship as a journalist. It’s an essential commentary from Bogdanovich, one of the most eloquent of all directors when it comes to explaining his choices and how he implemented them.   ",

        "title": "Greta Gerwig to Direct Two ‘Narnia’ Movies for Netflix — Report",
        "content": "Greta Gerwig will be helming the new “Chronicles of Narnia” adaptations for Netflix.The “Barbie” writer-director officially has “at least” a two-picture deal for bringing the beloved novels to life again, this time at the streamer. Four years after Netflix announced a multi-year partnership with The C.S. Lewis Company, The New Yorker confirmed rumors that had circulated for some months that three-time Oscar nominee Gerwig will be attached to direct the “Narnia” films.The news was shared in a wide-ranging interview with Mattel executives and Gerwig’s team for The New Yorker centered on “Barbie” and the ever-expanding search to find more IP to adapt.“Greta and I have been very consciously constructing a career,” Gerwig’s UTA agent Jeremy Barber told the publication. “Her ambition is to be not the biggest woman director but a big studio director. And Barbie was a piece of I.P. that was resonant to her.”Gerwig added of her upcoming “Barbie” film that she most likely will not make a feature again about a toy.“It would have to be something that has some strange hook in me, that feels like it goes to the marrow,” she said. “I don’t know if there’s a doll that anyone is as mad at.”Gerwig most recently appeared in Noah Baumbach’s Netflix film “White Noise” and wrapped production on “Barbie,” which she directed and co-wrote with Baumbach. Gerwig’s previous literary adaptation “Little Women” was Oscar-nominated. She is additionally a co-writer on Disney’s live-action “Snow White” movie starring “West Side Story” breakout Rachel Zegler.“The Chronicles of Narnia” was brought to the big screen for a film trilogy spanning from 2005 to 2010. The first film, “The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,” grossed over $745 million worldwide. The fantasy film, based on Lewis’ 1950 novel of the same name, starred Liam Neeson (voicing the lion Aslan), Tilda Swinton, and James McAvoy.The 2018 Netflix deal is the first time a single company has obtained the rights to all seven “Narnia” books. eOne’s Mark Gordan, Douglas Gresham, and Vincent Sieber are set to serve as executive producers on all upcoming films and TV series based on the novels.“Narnia is one of those rare properties that spans multiple generations and geographies,” Gordon said in a 2018 press statement, via Deadline. “We cannot wait to get started on the multiple productions we hope to undertake.”Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos added, “C.S. Lewis’ beloved ‘Chronicles of Narnia’ stories have resonated with generations of readers around the world. Families have fallen in love with characters like Aslan and the entire world of Narnia, and we’re thrilled to be their home for years to come.”Author Lewis’ stepson Douglas Gresham said, “It is wonderful to know that folks from all over are looking forward to seeing more of Narnia, and that the advances in production and distribution technology have made it possible for us to make Narnian adventures come to life all over the world. Netflix seems to be the very best medium with which to achieve this aim, and I am looking forward to working with them towards this goal.”IndieWire has reached out to reps for Gerwig and Netflix for comment.",

        "title": "Mads Mikkelsen Isn’t Interested in ‘Cutie Pie’ Roles Because He Prefers Playing ‘Losers’",
        "content": "The opening scene of “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” takes fans back to the 1940s as a de-aged Harrison Ford faces off with Nazi scientist Dr. Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) in the aftermath of World War II. Soon after, the film fast forwards several decades and shows Voller still clinging to the past by obsessing over Hitler’s defeat.The villainous loser is the kind of character that Mikkelsen has become synonymous with in recent years — and the actor is well aware of his reputation for playing sleazy figures. In a new interview with GQ, Mikkelsen explained that he has always been most comfortable playing offbeat, sinister characters.“To combine it — to do something real and also be a cutie pie — I don’t really find it interesting,” Mikkelsen said. “I’m not into the ‘hair falling in your eyes, be cute in a corner.’ Not me. The losers are fun. Because we know them. You might have been in that situation yourself sometimes.”Mikkelsen added that his string of villainous turns in blockbuster franchises like “Indiana Jones” and “Fantastic Beasts” affords him the creative freedom to take on more adventurous international projects.“If there’s nothing else, I’ll definitely do this, because it’s fun,” he said. “And then I can do whatever I want back in Europe.”Mikkelsen’s remarks echo similar comments that he made in a 2021 interview with IndieWire’s Anne Thompson. The actor said that he would like to eventually branch out and play more non-villains, but he still enjoys playing bad guys in iconic franchises.“I’m playing misunderstood people,” he said. “I’ve had a few non-villainous American roles that tend to be the baddies; I did an American film called ‘Arctic.’ He’s not a villain, so I’m grateful for that. Maybe times will turn a little, and people are watching a little more of the Danish stuff. Maybe they’ll accept a funny accent for an everyday-man character.  If that’s not the case, I’m happy with what I’m doing. I’m happy I’ve been invited into some great franchises, like the Bond, Marvel, and Indiana Jones. It’s a luxury, so if that’s what’s coming my way, I’ll take it any day. If they do want me to do something else, I’ll give it a shot!”",

        "title": "Anthony Mackie Recalls Harrison Ford’s Response to His Nerves on ‘Captain America 4’ Set: ‘Let’s Shoot This Piece of Sh*t’",
        "content": "“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” will be the last time Harrison Ford dons a fedora and bullwhip to play the iconic adventurer, but fans will still have plenty of opportunities to see him on the big screen.The actor is diving straight into another blockbuster Disney franchise by joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, the role previously played by the late William Hurt. Ford will make his debut as the character in next summer’s “Captain America: Brave New World” before suiting up again in “Thunderbolts” next December.Few Hollywood projects are bigger than a Marvel movie, but even Ford’s superhero co-stars found themselves intimidated by his movie star gravitas. In an interview with Inverse, Anthony Mackie recalled his nerves about working with Ford and the fittingly nonchalant way that the “Star Wars” legend put him at ease.“The first day was so intimidating,” Mackie said. “I was so fucking nervous I couldn’t remember my lines. He’s Harrison fucking Ford. There is this aura about him. But he dispels that really quickly because he’s such a cool guy. He’s everything a movie star should be. He would say, ‘Let’s shoot this piece of shit.’ And everybody was like, ‘Yeah, let’s shoot this shit.’”“Captain America: Brave New World” will be the first full movie with Mackie wielding the shield as Captain America since Chris Evans departed the franchise after “Avengers: Endgame.” The actor explained that Ford’s iteration of Thaddeus Ross plays a key role in the film and that the two men share multiple scenes together.“We spent a good bit of time together,” he said. “Ross and Cap have always had that relationship, where they were friends and they respected each other, but they always bumped heads. That’s their relationship in the storyline.”“Captain America: Brave New World” is directed by Julius Onah from a script written by Dalan Musson and Malcolm Spellman. In addition to Mackie and Ford, the film stars Danny Ramirez, Liv Tyler, Rosa Salazar, and Tim Blake Nelson. Disney is set to release the film in theaters on July 26, 2024.",

        "title": "‘Indiana Jones’ May Lose More Money Than ‘The Flash’ as Summer Now Lags Behind 2022",
        "content": "“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” (Disney), with a reported production budget close to $300 million, opened to $130 million worldwide. That includes the studio’s generous estimate of $60 million for the U.S./Canada.This weekend marks the midway point of the summer movie season, which began with expectations that it might achieve a 20 percent uptick against 2022. As of now, the season’s total gross sits slightly below last year.Add in marketing, including its Cannes Film Festival premiere, and the total investment for “Indiana” might total $450 million with no path to profit. It might lose as much as “The Flash” (Warner Bros. Discovery), which cost closer to $200 million and will see a worldwide gross around $250 million.Unless there’s a massive turnaround for “Indiana” (unlikely, given its initial trajectory and with “Mission: Impossible” opening July 12), it will get to between $300 million and $350 million worldwide. With somewhat more than half returned to Disney in film rental, that’s under $200 million versus its huge cost.Other summer releases have fallen short, but the total collapse of “Indiana” comes as something of a shock. The fifth film in the classic series that began in 1981 with “Raiders of the Lost Ark” has extraordinary precedents: The first four installments were all excellent performers, ranking as the first to third best of their respective years.True, the 2008 “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” wasn’t a favorite among critics or fans — but even so, it grossed $786 million worldwide (over $1 billion in current dollars). Star Harrison Ford is now 80 (when he shot the first “Indiana,” he was 38), but his energy and star power remains as a TV star with Paramount+ title “1923” and Apple TV’s “Shrinking.” Another shot at the franchise might have been one more reason that Disney acquired Lucasfilm for $4 billion in 2012.The durability of the “Indiana Jones” franchise is unusual, but it’s not unique; witness another Steven Spielberg property with the “Jurassic Park” films. However, there are a few key differences. “Jurrasic Park” produced six films in 30 years while “Indiana Jones” saw five films in 40 years. (Then again, “Top Gun: Maverick” waited 40 years for its first sequel, to no ill effect.) “Jurassic Park” also adjusted its casting, swapping Sam Neill for Chris Pratt. Of course, Ford is Indiana Jones and his age proved to be a publicity centerpiece.“Indiana Jones” also faced the Cannes misstep: Not only did the film falter with critics, but it also began the global PR response more than a month before its release. Here as well, it failed to follow in the footsteps of “Top Gun: Maverick.”“Indiana” overperformed with the older crowd, but not in sufficient numbers. A mediocre B+ Cinemascore (“Maverick” was A+, “The Flash” B) suggests weak word of mouth.It is noteworthy that Disney has four films in the Top 10 this week — five if you include #11, “The Boogeyman.” The studio deserves credit for making a huge commitment to theatrical. Combined, these five titles (which also include “Elemental,” “The Little Mermaid,” and “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3”) likely come to significantly over $1.5 billion in production and marketing costs.Disney had the confidence to do that because when these decisions were made, brands were the mantra. Now, it either needs to find new brands or figure out how to create original titles.For now, theaters rise and fall on Disney more than with any other studio. Its lineup was one reason for the bullish summer predictions, and its performance — “Guardians” decent but slightly below the standard for early-summer Marvel, “Mermaid” good domestically though faltering overseas, “Elemental” another big loss — contributed significantly to the season’s shortfall. (Still to come this month is “The Haunted Mansion” July 28. Compared to “Indiana” it’s a bargain with a $158 million reported production budget.)“Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken”Universal’s DreamWorks Animation title “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken” also opened this weekend, barely causing a ripple with a $5.2 million take against a reported cost of $70 million.It’s hard to imagine this summer’s results not having repercussions at Disney and other studios. WBD must contend with “The Flash” and Universal saw a real disappointment in “Fast X” — another very expensive franchise that might lose money. All of this happened before the ongoing WGA strike and the potential SAG strike, which could slow the pipeline even more.Through Sunday’s estimates, the summer take has been around $1.83 billion. Last year through July 3, it was $1.846 billion. This weekend should be one of the summer’s best of the summer, but it’s down 34 percent from last year’s $190 million. Year to date, the box office is still 18 percent ahead of 2022.There is hope for improvement with three major titles (besides “Mission,” “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie” the week after). Self-proclaimed theatrical saviors Christopher Nolan and Tom Cruise are still needed (with hopes that Greta Gerwig can join them).More of a problem is, for all of its disappointment, “Indiana” represented nearly half of the weekend’s gross. “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” held well at $11.5 million for #2, but it and “Elemental” ($11.3 million) were the only other films to gross more than $10 million. “Spider-Verse” should end up with a $400 million domestic, possibly the summer’s best.Like “Spider-Verse,” “Elemental” dropped gently at 39 percent. The Pixar film is at $89 million and will likely end up ahead of “The Flash.” It’s #8 this weekend, down 67 percent and has not yet grossed $100 million.At #5 is “No Hard Feelings” (Sony), which dropped 50 percent in its second week. It’s another disappointment. Wes Anderson’s “Asteroid City” dropped to #9, a 58 percent drop, but it grossed a healthy $18.1 million. With foreign, it’s close to $30 million.The per-theater average for “Asteroid,” now in 1,901 theaters, was $1,999. That compares to $1,708 for “Past Lives” (A24), which tripled its theater count to 906. The latter film still has a shot at $10 million, a decent result for a lower-budget indie film from a first-time director and no stars.New York’s Film Forum had a weekend that would have been great pre-COVID. Two terrific showings came from the reissue of Jean-Luc Godard’s “Contempt” (Rialto) with $15,000 and Cinema Guild’s documentary “Umberto Eco: Library of the World” with $9,152. “Every Body” (Focus), a documentary about intersexuality, managed only $145,000 in 255 theaters.1.

        "content": "Many great actors have filmed provocative scenes that they’d rather their families didn’t watch, but Ewan McGregor was thrilled to show his children the grossest scene of his career.Addressing press at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival (via Variety), the “Obi-Wan Kenobi” star opened up about the joys of introducing his kids to his filmography. He took particular pleasure in showing his daughter the infamous scene in “Trainspotting” where he plunges into the aptly nicknamed “worst toilet in Scotland” to retrieve some heroin.“I wasn’t there when [my daughter] Clara watched ‘Trainspotting’ for the first time,” McGregor said. “But I did used to show my kids the toilet scene. Just for a laugh. It’s a unique situation, perhaps, for a father to be able to show his children footage of him going down the toilet.”“Trainspotting” wasn’t the only movie from McGregor’s filmography that he used to traumatize his children. The actor also showed his daughter Baz Luhrmann’s “Moulin Rouge!” at a young age, recalling that she enjoyed the film despite some of the suggestive content.“I have a memory of showing Clara ‘Moulin Rouge!,’ however,” he said. “I think she was nine years old. I put it on, and then I hear this wailing and crying. I rushed in, asking if I should switch it off and she went ‘Nooo!’”The shock value that the “Trainspotting” scene still offers in 2023 is a testament to the film’s enduring quality. Danny Boyle’s cult classic, which spawned a well-received 2017 sequel, is still considered one of the most entertaining movies about addiction ever made. Boyle has said he attributes that to his decision to portray the effects of heroin use as something considerably different than what people experience in real life.“I think if you’re being honest, the first film resembled more MDMA drug abuse than actual heroin abuse,” Boyle said in a 2017 interview with IndieWire. “The adrenaline of the film was much greater, whereas heroin abuse is obviously a very dull subject to actually look at – not much happens. People just stall in the corner, really, or go fairly soporific.”",

        "content": "Russell Crowe wants to make something extremely clear: He is not in “Gladiator 2.”Ridley Scott‘s upcoming sequel, which picks up two decades after the events of the Oscar-winning classic, is set to star Paul Mescal as a rising member of the Roman ruling class. Crowe will not be reprising his iconic role as Maximus, who died at the end of the first film. But that hasn’t stopped people from asking him about the movie.At a press conference at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival (via Variety), Crowe complained about how much time he spends answering questions about a movie with which he has no involvement.“They should be fucking paying me for the amount of questions I am asked about a film I am not even in,” Crowe said. “It has nothing to do with me. In that world, I am dead. Six feet under. But I do admit to a certain tinge of jealousy, because it reminds me of when I was younger and what it meant for me, in my life.”He continued, “I don’t know anything about the cast, I don’t know anything about the plot. I am dead! But I know that if Ridley has decided to do a second part of the story, over 20 years later, he must have had very strong reasons. I can’t think of this movie being anything other than spectacular.”This isn’t the first time Crowe has publicly distanced himself from “Gladiator 2.” In another recent interview, he wished the cast and creative team good luck but explained that the film does not involve his character.“I’m sure at some point in time they’ll want to ask me about something, but they haven’t brought anything up in a while,” Crowe said. “It’s an extension of the narrative, but it is long beyond Maximus’ passing, so it doesn’t really involve me at all. I hear that young fella Paul is a good dude and I wish him the best of luck with it. I think where they’re picking the story up from, a young Lucius, stepping into the role of emperor. I think that’s a very smart idea within the world of the film that we created.”",

        "content": "“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” director James Mangold is already plotting a reunion with Lucasfilm on an upcoming original “Star Wars” movie. But it won’t mark his first time writing scripts set in a galaxy far, far away.Mangold previously tried to develop a Boba Fett spin-off movie that would have taken the franchise in a dramatically different direction than what ultimately materialized in “The Book of Boba Fett.” In a new appearance on Happy Sad Confused, Mangold recalled writing a script that would have pushed the boundaries of what’s acceptable in the “Star Wars” universe.“At the point I was doing it I was probably scaring the shit out of everyone,” Mangold said. “I was making much more of a borderline R-rated, single-planet spaghetti Western. They probably would never be able to embrace Baby Yoda if I had made that. It didn’t really belong in the world I was kind of envisioning.”The director lamented that his plans for the movie were ultimately scrapped after Lucasfilm pivoted to focusing on television.“In a moment of corporate realignment or whatever happened with the Han Solo movie, they just suddenly decided they weren’t making pictures like that, and the opportunities in streaming presented themselves,” he said. “I was just listening to Ennio Morricone all day, all night, and typing away. I’m not sure it ever would have happened. I’m not sure it was in anyone’s plans, what I was thinking.”While making a “Star Wars” movie would be a daunting challenge for any filmmaker, Mangold is no stranger to playing in big sandboxes. In a recent interview with IndieWire’s Anne Thompson, he recalled overcoming his initial hesitation about directing “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” because he wanted to work with his heroes.“I had admired all these cool potential collaborators all my life. And despite warning signs of this kind of a movie being a bear to manage and to launch, and expectations would run in all sorts of directions, and not all of them could ever be met, the thing that was most seductive was the personal opportunity to work with Harrison, Steven, Kathy, George, and John Williams,” he said. “It was impossible to say ‘no’ to what was essentially the personal opportunity of a lifetime because you don’t ever get close to people unless you do something together.”",

        "content": "James Cameron‘s decision to blow up the premise of his “Terminator” franchise led to one of the most successful sequels of all time. Arnold Schwarzenegger‘s eponymous cyborg was portrayed as a cold blooded villain in the first film, but returned as a hero protecting the very family he was originally sent to destroy in “Terminator 2: Judgement Day.”The change produced many of the most iconic moments of Schwarzenegger’s film career — but the actor wasn’t convinced it was going to work.At a panel discussion held at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures before a screening of “Terminator 2” on Wednesday night, Schwarzenegger heaped praise on Cameron’s writing abilities before recalling his initial skepticism about the shakeup.“The reason why it became a big hit was, number one, Jim Cameron. Jim Cameron is a genius writer. He came up with this brilliant idea, even though at the beginning I was suspicious,” Schwarzenegger said. “He said ‘I want to make you a good Terminator.'” Schwarzenegger says that he tried to convince Cameron to double down on the brutality of the first film, but the action icon admitted that his desire for violence was partially motivated by his box office rivalry with Sylvester Stallone.“I said ‘What do you mean a good Terminator?’ I was killing 68 people in the first one,” he said. “In the second one I have to kill 150. We go up! Cut their throats and shoot them with a cannon and run them over with a car.’ I had to outdo Stallone. I said that my whole mission was being number one at killing amounts of people on screen.”Cameron was unconcerned about Schwarzenegger’s feud with Stallone and decided to move ahead with his initial plan. If anything, his pleas prompted Cameron to remove even more violence from the script.“He said ‘Arnold, stop it. You’re a very sick guy. I am gonna make sure that in ‘Terminator 2,’ you’re not gonna kill one single person,'” Schwarzenegger said. “I said that’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard. How can this be ‘Terminator 2’ without me killing anyone? At least throw a few token bodies in there.”",

        "content": "The recent slew of high profile layoffs at Turner Classic Movies sent shockwaves through the film community. Many saw the ousting of longtime executives who shaped TCM into a beloved resource for movie buffs as a sign that Warner Bros. Discovery was planning to neglect or even eliminate the network. News of the shakeup led to increased attention on TCM, with many prominent voices advocating for its role in the current cinema landscape.While the studio was able to tamp down the outrage by announcing that Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, and Paul Thomas Anderson would be involved in the network’s new programming efforts, TCM’s long term health is a topic of concern for cinephiles around the world.While gutting a beloved network to save on costs sounds like something Logan Roy might pull on “Succession,” Brian Cox counts himself among TCM’s most ardent supporters. In a new interview with Above the Line, Cox voiced his support for Turner Classic Movies and the work that the network does to keep film history alive.“I’ve just written a thing for Facebook because I’m horrified,” Cox said. “The head of Warner Brothers, once they get rid of TCM/Turner Classic Movies, which I think is one of the most vital resources — and certainly Robert Osborne set that up, and the five gals who run it now. I mean, who’s an expert on film? I just love that sense of who we are, where we’ve come from, and our history. It’s vital to me that we see that and live it.”Cox explained that he doesn’t just see the network as a history lesson — he uses the timeless acting in classic films as inspiration for his own craft.“For me, the history of cinema, the watching of it, and the way that TCM presents it are incredible resources because they really make me understand how far we’ve traveled,” he said. “But also how far we haven’t traveled. You know, we’ve traveled technically, but in terms of the truth of acting, there are no more true players than Spencer Tracy or Katherine Hepburn. And you see them together in what they create, so the cinema has always been vital to me. Absolutely vital.”",

        "title": "‘Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken’ Turns the Sea Monster Into DreamWorks’ First Female Warrior",
        "content": "“Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken,” which marks DreamWorks Animation’s first female-led feature, adds a new twist to the coming-of-age/monster transformation story (Pixar’s “Luca” and “Turning Red”). It turns the legendary sea monster into a clan of heroic female warriors that protect the Seven Seas as part of a mother-daughter conflict spanning three generations.There’s the titular teen sea beast (Lana Condor), living as a human in the small town of Oceanside with her family, unaware that she’s secretly a giant kraken underwater; her overprotective mom (Toni Collette), who hides their secret identity; and her grandmamah (Jane Fonda), who proudly serves as the Warrior Queen of the Seven Seas.Director Kirk DeMicco (“Vivo,” “The Croods”) joined the project when it was already in production. He was a fan of high school comedies (represented by Ruby awkwardly navigating her way through high school as a misfit) and was intrigued about animating kraken. “But the big thing really was that mother-daughter story and the three generations of women that really appealed to me,” he told IndieWire. “Focusing on Ruby and her mom, and her grandmother being a mentor trying to get her to embrace her powers.”But there’s another dimension to this female-led story: Ruby’s friendship with Chelsea (Emmy winner Annie Murphy of “Schitt’s Creek”), the outgoing and popular new student who confides that she’s secretly a mermaid so they can explore their powers together.“It’s really this girl caught between all of these strong women who have ideas how she should live her life,” DeMicco said. “I think that was the exciting part of this coming-of-age story about Ruby finding her own path. And it’s a very teenage moment, I think, when you feel alone in high school and you meet that [new BFF] and you just hope that it’s the right voice that’s leading you down the path.”In terms of animation, the colorful kraken were inspired by a combination of octopi and the pioneering work of Max Fleischer (Betty Boop and Popeye). The bodies of the Gillmans were very elastic and specially rigged for fluid bend-and-stretch (overseen by head of animation Carlos Fernandez Puertolas). Ruby, as an awkward teen, stands out in her own twisty way, and then, as she practices being a giant kraken underwater, slowly develops confidence in the way she swims and asserts her superpowers with the help of her grandmother.“It was fun to see sort of this rubber hose animation that could give you lots of opportunity,” said DeMicco. “It’s in the DNA of animation history, but it was organic to who they were as octopus characters and those kind of silhouettes, and the way we could shape them was really inspiring.“And the one place I thought was really nice to watch is just how it tracks,” he continued. “Both in the opening sequence when you get to meet every single one of the characters just through their animation style, and then on the giant kraken side, where we’re watching them swim. In their element, they’re elegant and balletic, and the way their tentacles moved added some grace and beauty that we haven’t seen before.”Production designer Pierre Olivier Vincent (the “How to Train Your Dragon” franchise) embraced a colorful, tubular, hand-crafted environment for the small town of Oceanside where the Gillmans live. “It was very much inspired by an octopus with this organic curviness,” DeMicco said. “It’s also a place where a girl that just happens to be blue might fit in. It’s a quirky, pushed world that feels relatable to us.”The Gillman house has nostalgic reminders of their former underwater existence, with oceanic blues and other complementary colors, while Ruby’s bedroom is inside a tower shaped like a Martha’s Vineyard lighthouse.Meanwhile, the opulent kraken castle of the family’s royal matriarch evokes a place of power. There are no straight lines, and it’s filled with glass and jade for refracting light. Both ancient and modern, it’s a home intended to be alluring to Ruby.“We wanted to make that kingdom and the characters something that could be aspirational,” added DeMicco. “And also a world befitting of a royal queen like Jane Fonda’s grandmamah. Bringing that deep sea bioluminescence jellyfish sort of vibe to the krakens was a big win.”",

        "title": "The Secret Power of SAG: How 160,000 Actors Can Help Save Hollywood by Forcing Studios to Break Rank",
        "content": "Kohn’s Corner is a weekly column about the challenges and opportunities of sustaining American film culture.Suspense hovers around whether SAG-AFTRA could reach a deal with studios this week, as the union has flown past the June 30 expiration of its contract and extended negotiations to July 12. The next few days could determine the future of the business, but the situation only intensified over the past week with an unexpected update.The last thing that SAG-AFTRA’s 160,000 members needed to see was Fran Drescher’s smiling face. When the SAG president and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland circulated a giddy update June 23 about an impending deal — one without specifics, beyond offering that it would be “seminal” — it didn’t catalyze the reaction they wanted. Rather than see the membership cheer its efforts, the union leaders received an urgent open letter signed by the group’s A-list members.“We are prepared to strike if it comes to that,” they wrote in a letter signed by over 300 people in fewer than 72 hours, including Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep, and Ben Stiller. “We feel that our wages, our craft, our creative freedom, and the power of our union has been undermined in the last decade. We need to reserve those trajectories… This is not a moment to meet in the middle.”In other words: Quit mugging for the camera and get to work. SAG members are ready to strike not only to make a point, but also because they know that it could yield results that the current WGA strike can’t do on its own.“I really think that video was the impetus for the letter,” one actor who signed it, speaking on condition of anonymity, told me this week. “I think everyone’s feeling the heat. We should at least show that we’re willing to go on strike for the leverage. What will the directors direct if there’s nobody to write or act?”SAG’s decision, whether it’s a strike, a transformative deal that upends the system, or one that sees only modest gains, may impact the next decade or more. The union has the power to rewrite the economics of Hollywood through severe disruption — or, to settle for an outcome that puts them at extreme disadvantage as residuals fade into the streaming ether.There are genuine concerns around AI, too — how actors can maintain the rights to their likeness, now that technology exists to keep them performing after they die — but most SAG members I know say they’re less invested in those conversations; they want a deal that helps them maintain a stable profession. “A strike will suck, sure,” one prominent actor texted me this week, “but it’s remarkable how many films I’ve had on streamers, and I don’t get a dime for any of it.”As I asked around this week, the word “existential” came up more than once. Another signatory of the open letter, an actor who has been in studio movies since the ‘80s, wrote me: “It’s at a crisis point. If the deal isn’t good, a lot of people will be forced out of the business. I see it as a national labor crisis, not just about our business. It’s the collision of big tech and oligarchs dismantling equal pay and protections.”In previous negotiations, SAG has been badly burned. In August 2020, at the height of the pandemic, the SAG-AFTRA healthcare plan suddenly cut out anyone over the age of 65, eliminating thousands of older performers.“I know actors in their 70s who are retired and make their living off their residuals because they’ve been working for 50 years or more, but they don’t have health insurance anymore,” one actor told me. “I had friends on the negotiating committee who defended themselves by saying, ‘Well, the AMPTP doesn’t want to give us health insurance because they’re bullies!’ Which is completely the case, but I’m sorry, you just can’t let them. You don’t get up from the table until they agree to pay this stuff.”A strike would put a lot of people out of work, but it also stands a good shot at splintering the studios’ resolve. Consider what happened when the WGA went after agencies for intrusive packaging fees in 2020. Rather than rely on a single negotiating body like the AMPTP, the writers guild had to work through each of the big three talent agencies — WME, CAA and UTA — to arrive at an agreement that eliminated packaging fees. It was a messy, piecemeal operation that left a lot open to interpretation — and agents still seek workarounds that line their pockets. But it happened.Since we can’t discern the specifics of what studios and actors want, let’s assume that one major disruptive streamer — cough, Netflix — may have less investment in an immediate deal than any other studio.Apple and Amazon, the biggest companies in the world, could certainly pony up to a new financial reality around residuals that makes the actors happy without feeling destablizing the bottom line. Only Netflix has suggested that it could limp along more or less intact in the midst of a debilitating strike. And it’s true: Netflix can build a pipeline of low-cost unscripted and library content, doubling down on acquisitions, docuseries, and international productions.Legacy studios aren’t built that way; they were forced into the streaming game to keep up with competition. They need the talent business and don’t want to lose that foothold.So… maybe other studios could break rank and talk directly to SAG to sort out their needs. The outcome may not please all contingencies, but it would allow for some semblance of forward momentum. A few actors told me they would be happier with this scattered result than fighting against a single entity indifferent to their needs.“I don’t think Netflix should’ve joined the AMPTP,” a SAG member told me. “They want to influence everyone to do what they’re doing because they’re on top of the world.”And it could stay that way, no matter what deals come out of the current negotiations. If traditional Hollywood turned its back on the streamer, this cinephile would certainly embrace a new economic reality that forced Netflix to become the preeminent distributor for international storytelling. Buy up all the festival hits. Invest in auteurs worldwide. Everybody wins!OK, too idealistic — but there are no rules mandating that SAG can only finalize a deal through the AMPTP. The WGA’s negotiating tactics have obscured this reality because its demands remain hard for any studio to get behind, particularly as it pertains to the minimum number of writers they want in a writers room. I would bet more studios want to reach a deal for streaming residuals than the AMPTP as a whole, and eliminating it from the equation would almost certainly yield better results.There’s no guarantee something like that will happen if SAG goes on strike. However, it’s the kind of possibility that makes a strike feasible if the actors can’t make a good deal now.Then again, consider the sunniest possibility. Perhaps Drescher and Crabtree-Ireland projected confidence in their video update because real progress is being made. “The Nanny” star might be close to negotiating a deal that sets the acting profession on a positive track for the next decade or more.Such an outcome could at the very least create a roadmap for the WGA to see a way through its own conundrum in the foreseeable future. Nobody should hold their breath on that front, but one thing is clear: These negotiations will end not with a video, but a vision. If SAG leadership doesn’t provide that, then its membership will have to fill in the gaps.As usual, I invite feedback to this weekly column: eric@indiewire.comLast week, I wrote about the changing of the guard at TCM and its perilous situation at WarnerMedia Discovery. Here are a few of the responses I received:Seems to me that with all the creative people who treasure TCM we should be be able to come up with a way to save it from the every day monetization pressures suffered by all networks. … TCM has been an integral part of the maintaining the history of America through the eyes of film. It’s almost like PBS — and perhaps should be funded in an alternative way where it is not subject to the whims of studio executives who are strictly interested in the bottom line. I see TCM as a cultural treasure. I imagine with the monetary support of directors actors and philanthropists as well as a structure that removes TCM from the competitive market — and perhaps looks at it more as an educational channel — TCM can be saved without being chopped down.Your article is a perfect distillation of what our future needs. You speaking up on TCM’s behalf means the world to all of us.",

        "title": "SAG-AFTRA and Studios Extend Contract Negotiations Until July 12",
        "content": "A potential actors strike is being put on hold. SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP have yet to reach a tentative deal on a new minimum bargaining agreement ahead of their current contract expiring on June 30, but the two sides have agreed to extend the current contract and continue negotiations past the deadline.Both organizations representing the actors and studios announced Friday that the contract that was meant to expire at midnight tonight will now expire July 12 at 11:59 PM PT.So while SAG-AFTRA currently has the power to call for a strike, the guild’s leaders for now will remain at the negotiating table in an attempt to reach a new deal. The guild and AMPTP will continue operating under a media black out until then.“In order to exhaust every opportunity to achieve the righteous contract we all demand and deserve, after thorough deliberation it was unanimously decided to allow additional time to negotiate by extending the contract,” the members of the SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee said in an open letter. “No one should mistake this extension for weakness. We see you. We hear you. We are you.”Negotiations between SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP began on June 7. Before negotiations began, members approved a strike authorization vote with nearly 98 percent of members who participated saying they’d be willing to hit the picket lines, which gave SAG-AFTRA added leverage heading into talks. More recently, over 2000 actors signed a letter aimed at SAG leadership saying they were both willing to strike and willing to “make sacrifices that leadership is not” in order to get a transformative deal.While many items on the negotiating agenda have not been disclosed, the guild is fighting for improved residuals, higher minimum wages, and regulations around self-taped auditions, as well as guardrails around the use of AI.The actors last went on strike against the studios back in 1980 for three months and three days in a fight over home video residuals, one that shut down film and TV production and even saw actors boycotting the Emmys.Striking writers as part of the WGA will have to wait a little longer to see if SAG-AFTRA does join them on the picket lines. The Writers Guild has been on strike for two months since May 1, in which development has halted, production on many new shows and movies has been either temporarily or indefinitely put on hold until a strike is over, and many writers and showrunners have seen their overall deals with studios suspended.The DGA, or the Directors Guild of America, reached their own tentative deal with the studios back on June 4, and despite some vocal dissent from some hyphenate writers-directors, DGA membership officially ratified the new deal on June 23 with 87 percent of the 6,728 members who voted choosing to ratify it.",

Now, in a new behind-the-scenes featurette for the upcoming Paramount film, Cruise shares how he learned how to speed-fly.“It’s a very beautiful and delicate sport,” Cruise said of the intense sport he spent years training for. “We’re gonna do spirals, and we’re landing at an incredibly high speed, over 80 kilometers an hour.”“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning” director Christopher McQuarrie noted that speed-flying is “one of the most dangerous sports in the world.” While visually similar to paragliding, speed-flying occurs closer to cliffs to achieve more acceleration; however, there is also a higher probability of crashing.“While it may look similar, speed-flying is not skydiving,” McQuarrie said. “Skydiving is fairly predictable. Speed-flying is very unpredictable. Behind the scenes, we were all in absolute terror.”McQuarrie added, “With Tom, there are no limits.”Lead star Cruise admitted earlier this year that with his motorcycle stunt, he was worried it was “not going to end well” if he didn’t pull the parachute in time.“I had about six seconds once I departed the ramp to pull the chute and I don’t want to get tangled in the bike,” Cruise said. “If I do, that’s not going to end well.”The “Eyes Wide Shut” actor previously shared that his favorite element of filmmaking is the practical stunts.“I am a very physical actor and I love doing them. I study and train and take a lot of time figuring it all out,” Cruise said in 2021. “I have broken a lot of bones! The first time of any stunt is nerve-wracking, but it’s also exhilarating. I have been told a few times during shooting a stunt to stop smiling.”With a burgeoning stunt category rumored to be recognized by the Academy Awards, it seems like Cruise’s chances of an Oscar just might prove to be true.“Dead Reckoning Part One” opens July 12 from Paramount Pictures.",

        "title": "Netflix’s Animated ‘Nimona’ Mixes ‘Sleeping Beauty’ with ‘Blade Runner’",
        "content": "[Editor’s note: The following interview contains spoilers for “Nimona.”]Netflix‘s “Nimona” (now streaming) represents the latest post “Spider-Verse” animated breakthrough in handmade-looking 2D stylization. The twist here was creating a futuristic medieval fantasy that mixes “Sleeping Beauty” with “Blade Runner.” Fortunately, DNEG Animation (“Entergalactic”) answered the SOS after the trouble-plagued adaptation of ND Stevenson’s queer graphic novel about the titular teen shapeshifter (Chloë Grace Moretz) came back from the dead. That’s because Annapurna Animation and the streamer rescued the Blue Sky feature after Disney shuttered the Fox-owned animation studio in 2021.“We obviously followed it really closely, what happened to Blue Sky,” DNEG VFX supervisor Archie Donato told IndieWire. “We knew that they were shutting down. It was all over media and everything, so it was incredibly heartbreaking because we had many, many friends working there. We actually hired a lot of their animators and people in lighting and compositing and other departments. So we managed to save some jobs by bringing them to us and working remotely from Canada.”But DNEG was very busy juggling various projects, including Netflix’s “Entergalactic,” another breakthrough in creating a graphically illustrated look. In fact, DNEG revamped its pipeline for the Emmy hopeful, which spanned animation, shading, lighting, compositing, and rendering.While DNEG leveraged many of these new tools for “Nimona,” it also created several new ones for trickier lighting on characters and environments and for compositing hundreds of motion graphics to help punctuate Nimona’s emotional outbursts.Directed by Nick Bruno and Troy Quane (“Spies in Disguise”), the film concerns rebellious Nimona teaming up with legendary knight Lord Ballister (Riz Ahmed), who’s falsely accused of murder. However, their xenophobic society also targets Nimona because of her shapeshifting abilities.In translating the look of Stevenson’s graphic novel, production designer Aidan Sugano drew on Stevenson’s basic shape language for the curvy and chunky Nimona and the square-looking Ballister. He also took inspiration from two mid-century illustrators: Disney background artist Eyvind Earle (“Sleeping Beauty”) and wildlife artist Charley Harper, borrowing the elegant fluidity of the former and the geometric minimalism of the latter. But Sugano made sure the world building had modern appeal with billboards, holograms, and “Blade Runner”-like neon lighting.“There were some sequences that were worked on at Blue Sky, but the actual look of the film in translating the designer’s vision had not gone too far,” Donato said. “So we wanted to do justice to that. But Nick and Troy wanted to also make use of this opportunity to push it further because we were basically starting from scratch.”In essence, DNEG became animated shapeshifters by taking Blue Sky’s designs and assets (mostly still in layout form) and crafting the film to fit their pipeline. The directors wanted a flatter 2D look than “Entergalactic,” which was achieved by breaking up the character lighting into layers. DNEG removed all ambient occlusion lighting and added sharp lines everywhere to make clear separations between the layers of lights. This particularly came in handy for the densely-packed, medieval metropolis.“I’ve done different styles,” Donato added, “but the way Nick and Troy wanted it is how they would paint it as an illustration, not how the light would really disperse. So we designed a different way of doing it. Basically, we gave it very short fall-off, so instead of having the larger glows around the characters and environment, they were more like soft glows. We designed hard graphical glows but used them more like graphical overlays on top.”An early test in the lair where Nimona and Ballister are hiding helped lock in this technique. The place is cluttered and they wanted to overload the frame, particularly on Nimona’s “murder wall” containing drawings of her hit list. It was important to have that stand out as a fixture behind them.“What I wanted to do is to put together an image and then deconstruct that and understand what it would take to do this movie, “Donata said, “because the idea was that we had to use heavy, heavy compositing in the show, more so than in many other animated films. And the reason why was because we needed to treat elements separately from each other.“The other thing was matte paintings,” he continued. So instead of using depth of field or haze and stuff like that, we reduced the detail the farther you go. We call it depth desktop detail. It gives you the sense of depth, even though it’s a completely flat image.”Meanwhile, a lot of animation was devoted to Nimona’s shapeshifting characters, which included a rhino, cat, gorilla, wolf, and whale. These were given the signature pink, curvy, and chunky look but some were more fantastical with giant proportions.However, there’s a darker, villainous shadow creature, which required a lot more complexity. After much experimentation, they settled on a hard body character with a smoke effect composited on top. “So basically we rigged the character like we normally would rig a hard-body character,” said Donato. “We did all of the gray-shaded animation that was approved by Nick and Troy. But they took a major chance. They knew the components worked well separately, but they didn’t know if they were gonna work together. And they didn’t know what it was gonna look like at the end. So we put together one shot of the creature coming through the city. We did the full test like it was a final delivery.”It was nerve-wracking for the animation and VFX teams. But it worked because of the base character underneath. “So we got rid of the actual hard body and instead replaced that with the smokey elements in there,” Donato said. “That was supposed to react to the motion of the creature, so that’s why it was incredibly critical for the animation to be good. The velocity of the smoke, how the creature swings its arms, how the smoke would trail off, everything was based on the actual speed and movement of the creature.”Yet the sequence took place at night, and it was important not to lose track of the shadow creature. “So we started bright and dropped it off gradually as the city expanded,” added Donato. “That drove the audience’s eye to stay on the creature. Nick and Troy really wanted to make sure that it was really impactful.”",

        "title": "‘Tron: Ares’ Adds ‘Past Lives’ Star Greta Lee and Jodie Turner-Smith",
        "content": "“Tron: Ares,” the third “Tron” movie that will star Jared Leto, has added some serious indie cred.Greta Lee, the breakout of A24’s critical darling “Past Lives,” and “Queen & Slim” and “After Yang” actress Jodie Turner-Smith, have both joined the cast of the sci-fi film at Disney, an individual with knowledge of the project told IndieWire.Lee and Turner-Smith join a cast that includes Leto and Evan Peters. The film will be directed by Joachim Rønning (“Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,” “Kon-Tiki”).Lee will play the female lead in the project, a brilliant video game programmer and co-CEO of one of the world’s most successful technology companies. Turner-Smith has a significant role in the project, but her part is being kept under wraps.Plot details haven’t been unveiled, either, but THR is reporting that the film follows Leto as Ares, the manifestation of an all-powerful, sentient computer program, who makes his way into the real world. The first two “Tron” movies, including the original from 1982 and the rebooted sequel from 2010, follow how someone manages to get sucked into the computerized world of a video game.Jesse Wigutow and Jack Thorne wrote the script for “Tron: Ares.”The original “Tron” has become a cult classic and a groundbreaking early example of computer-generated imagery and animation on screen. The sequel “Tron: Legacy,” which brought back the original’s star Jeff Bridges and was directed by “Top Gun: Maverick” filmmaker Joseph Kosinski, brought in a respectable $400 million at the global box office, but a third film that would’ve brought back some of the cast from that film never got off the ground. “Tron: Legacy” is also famous for its score by Daft Punk.Lee broke out in a big way in Celine Song’s “Past Lives,” which IndieWire considers one of the finest movies of the year so far. But she’s also lent her voice to both of the “Spider-Verse” movies and is known for parts in “Russian Doll” and “The Morning Show.”Turner-Smith will next be seen in the Disney+ Star Wars series “The Acolyte” and was recently seen in “Murder Mystery 2” and in “White Noise.”Turner-Smith is represented by UTA, 111 Media, the Lede Company and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole. Lee is represented by UTA, Anonymous Content, and Jackoway Tyerman.THR first reported the news of Lee’s casting, and Turner-Smith’s casting was first reported by Variety.",

        "title": "Victor Nunez May Be the Best Director Most People Never Heard of — but Stanley Kubrick and Ava DuVernay Have",
        "content": "“I remember seeing a film that became really formative for me called ‘Ruby in Paradise.’ It was a film about a young woman finding herself. It’s a simple film. A beautiful film. And I thought, ‘Wow. I didn’t know a film could be like this.’ I’d never seen anything like this before.”That was director Ava DuVernay in the documentary “Only in Theaters” talking about “Ruby in Paradise,” winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 1993 Sundance Film Festival and one of several exquisitely crafted dramas from Florida writer-director Victor Nunez. Since his feature debut “Gal Young Un” in 1979, Nunez has slowly, quietly, and consistently built one of the American independent cinema’s most vital bodies of work, one centered around complex regional character studies like “Ruby” and its follow-up “Ulee’s Gold,” for which Peter Fonda was nominated for an Oscar.These films, along with Nunez’s 1984 masterpiece “A Flash of Green,” will be screened at the American Cinematheque in Los Angeles on July 8 and 9 as part of a long overdue tribute to Nunez, who will appear in person along with actors from his films including Ashley Judd, Ed Harris, Todd Field, and Lori Singer, the star of Nunez’s new film “Rachel Hendrix.” That film, in which Singer’s character struggles to let others into her life following the death of her husband, will have its L.A. premiere at the retrospective.DuVernay is hardly the only important director moved by Nunez’s work. “Within the first 30 seconds of meeting Stanley Kubrick for the first time, he said, ‘Tell me about Victor Nunez,'” Todd Field told IndieWire. “I said, ‘Well, from what I understand he works a lot like you. It’s just him and the actors with the tiniest amount of technical support. He operates his own camera and it’s a very different manner of working than normal industrial filmmaking.’ Stanley seemed really pleased to hear that, but of course when I told Victor he said, ‘Me and Stanley Kubrick? We couldn’t be more different.’ But they’re actually very, very similar. The aim is different, but the methodology has a relationship in terms of priorities of process.”The fact that Nunez does prioritize character and performance is probably why so many actors have done some of their best work in his films; Ashley Judd in “Ruby in Paradise,” Peter Fonda in “Ulee’s Gold,” and Ed Harris in “A Flash of Green” are just a few examples. Operating himself and often working in the super-16mm format with high-speed film stocks, Nunez creates an intimate style filled with visual texture that comes from the unusual properties of his grain and the way it interacts with light as well as his dedication to photographing parts of America not often seen on screen — and photographing them with the same love with which he approaches his characters.For Judd, shooting on location with Nunez in Panama City, Florida, was an integral part of her process. “The immediacy of real life was just very present,” she told IndieWire. “There was no distance between reality and the film set.” The sensitivity toward the locations and their residents in Nunez’s films that is easily felt by the viewer was just as obvious on set, according to Harris. “He has such strong feelings for Florida and its people and the local environment,” Harris told IndieWire. “His love for where he lives and the way that he cares about it creates a great environment full of detail, and it just gives you that much more as an actor.”Field added that it wasn’t just the immersion into the world of “Ruby in Paradise” that helped his performance, it was Nunez’s guidance through that world. “Actors love research, but typically that work is self-directed,” he said. “But with Victor, you had someone guiding you very specifically and saying, ‘Welcome to my world.’ That was a very powerful experience.” Josh Brolin, who worked with Nunez on “Coastlines,” felt the same way about that film’s St. George Island location. “I took a lot of pictures around there and I got to know a lot of people,” he told IndieWire. “I hung out with a lot of cops, which Victor helped set up. I hung out with a lot of fishermen in the area. It was a great vibe — I don’t think a typical movie would have shot there.”Brolin learned just how atypical Nunez’s process was early on in the shoot, when he forgot a line and called out for it. “I called out for a line and nobody said anything,” Brolin said, “and Victor came up to me and said, ‘We’re not doing the Hollywood thing. We’re not a typical crew, we’ve created our own paradigm. We don’t have a script supervisor.’ And I was like, ‘The one job you chose not to have is the script supervisor? To me that’s the most important job on the set!'” After that slightly combative start, Brolin came to appreciate Nunez’s approach and tight-knit team. “He created an incredible crew, and they were undyingly loyal to him.”Harris, who had one of his first leading roles in “A Flash of Green,” said that the environment Nunez created on set immediately put him at ease. “Victor has worked with a lot of the same people over the years, and it’s like joining a family,” Harris said. “It’s a very warm, embracing environment. There are no big egos involved and Victor is very generous and very humble.” Nunez’s generosity often extends to inviting his collaborators into parts of the process they might otherwise be excluded from. Harris recalled being welcome in the editing room, and Field said that as soon as Nunez learned he was about to study directing at the AFI, the first thing that he did was invite Field to look through the camera. “That was very much like Stanley too,” Field said. “Someone who was confident enough in what they were doing to not have any arbitrary boundaries in terms of disciplines.”The democratizing impulse that Nunez’s collaborators describe is clearly felt in the work, in which there’s a deep empathy for characters across a wide variety of economic and racial backgrounds. There’s also a deeply personal dedication to exploring social issues, but as Judd pointed out, these are not message movies. “Victor’s films are incredibly intelligent, but it’s instinctive and organic,” she said. “‘Ruby in Paradise’ is a feminist film, with Ruby dealing with all the things you would read about in feminist texts and theory or learn about in consciousness-raising groups. The movie is about sexual violence, poverty, the lack of educational opportunities through class, but Victor doesn’t tell you. He shows you, and he does it so beautifully that no one realizes he’s doing it.”“Victor was also at the forefront of inclusive filmmaking,” Judd added, noting that many of his films focused on women and people of color at a time when few other American filmmakers did so. “There are so many astute observations about daily life, expressed in the most subtle ways.”This intersection between the personal and the political and the visual poetry with which Nunez explores it makes his work essential viewing for anyone who cares about American independent cinema and how it reflects the culture — which in turn makes the Cinematheque retrospective and the arrival of a new Nunez film cause for celebration. “There’s a kind of arbitrariness to who’s involved in the conversation about the canon of the American cinema and who isn’t — there are winners and losers,” Field said. “But I also think the pursuit of a kind of cinema that isn’t on everyone’s lips is super exciting. Victor Nunez is standing right under our noses and we can’t even see him. If you like a cinema that’s thoughtful and caring and you haven’t heard of Victor Nunez, then it’s important that you see his work.”",

        "content": "This summer movie season hasn’t been without its mainstream success stories, from “The Little Mermaid” to “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.” But duds like “The Flash” are a reminder that even the biggest, loudest releases aren’t guaranteed hits.Now, internet buzz is centered around a pop culture matchup for the ages, as “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” open head-to-head on July 21. Early box office tracking, however, suggests that neither movie is poised to generate huge numbers. And with “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” tracking at a low $65 million for its opening this weekend (on a budget of around $250 million), it doesn’t seem that a busier post-pandemic summer movie season is the same thing as a profitable one.What gives?While audiences return to movie theaters, not every demographic is such an easy draw. In this week’s episode of Screen Talk, Eric Kohn and Anne Thompson break down those challenges and how they may play out in the coming weeks. Thompson also shares some initial thoughts on “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” another summer blockbuster that seems poised to do well — but will get bumped from IMAX screens once “Oppenheimer” takes them over.This week’s episode includes some additional discussion of the potential strike by SAG-AFTRA and why the negotiation could end up taking longer than originally planned. The hosts also share some viewing suggestions for July 4.Screen Talk will return after next week.Watch the full episode above or listen to it below.Screen Talk is produced by Azwan Badruzaman and available on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, and Spotify, and hosted by Megaphone.

        "title": "Jonathan Majors’ Lawyers Say ‘Method Acting’ Accounts for Alleged ‘Violent’ Behavior on ‘Magazine Dreams’ Set",
        "content": "Jonathan Majors is being accused of taking Method acting to the extreme.The “Creed III” actor, who was arrested on March 25 for allegedly assaulting, strangling, and harassing a romantic partner, is now being accused of acting “violently” on the set of “Magazine Dreams” and abusing crew members on “Devotion.”A Rolling Stone investigative report noted that Majors was “physically intimidating” a “Devotion” crew member by screaming at them. In the film, Majors portrays the U.S. Navy’s first Black aviator Jesse Brown.For Sundance film “Magazine Dreams,” producers allegedly warned production members to stay away from Majors due to his “Method acting” techniques.“I’ve heard of different Method actors and how their behavior is, but none of them are violent or rude toward their crew,” one production source said, noting that Majors was “was completely disrespectful and kind of violent toward everybody” and crew members were afraid they were “going to get hurt.”Majors’ attorney Dustin Pusch issued a statement to IndieWire in response to the additional accusations.“Jonathan Majors vehemently denies Rolling Stone’s false allegations that he physically, verbally, or emotionally abused anyone, let alone any of his past romantic partners…The allegations that Mr. Majors got physical with or physically intimidated anyone on any movie set are downright false,” Pusch said. “Everyone who has worked with Mr. Majors knows that he employs an immersive Method acting style, and while that can be misconstrued as rudeness at times, those who know Mr. Majors and work in the industry have attested to his dedication to his craft as well as his kindness.”Multiple other women in the Rolling Stone report who previously were romantically involved with Majors claimed he enlisted “emotional torture” and would get “filled with rage” to the point he needed to “hit something or punch something.”For the March 2023 arrest, Majors’ criminal defense lawyer Priya Chaudhry stated at the time, “All the evidence proves that Mr. Majors is entirely innocent and did not assault her whatsoever. Unfortunately, this incident came about because this woman was having an emotional crisis, for which she was taken to a hospital yesterday.  The NYPD is required to make an arrest in these situations, and this is the only reason Mr. Majors was arrested. We expect these charges to be dropped soon.”Majors’ accuser was granted a restraining order. The “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” actor, whose Kang the Conqueror character was the crux of the next Marvel phase, has been dropped by his manager and PR teams as of April 2023.",

        "title": "Sylvester Stallone’s Legacy Is Captured in Netflix’s ‘Sly’ — Watch the Teaser",
        "content": "A deep dive into Sylvester Stallone‘s life and legacy is coming soon.Netflix announced that documentary “Sly” will debut this November from director Thom Zimny (“Springsteen on Broadway”). The film will capture the decades-long career of the Oscar-nominated actor-writer-director-producer Stallone, whose works span from the “Rocky” franchise to new Paramount+ reality series “The Family Stallone.”The official Netflix synopsis reads: For nearly 50 years, Sylvester Stallone has entertained millions with iconic characters and blockbuster franchises, from “Rocky” to “Rambo” to “The Expendables.” This retrospective documentary offers an intimate look at the Oscar-nominated actor-writer-director-producer, paralleling his inspirational underdog-story with the indelible characters he has brought to life.“Sly” is produced by Sean Stuart, with co-producers Maren Domzalski and Adrienne Gerard. Stallone executive produces the docuseries, alongside Bill Zanker, Sam Delcanto, Braden Aftergood, Jon Beyer, Tom Forman, and Jenny Daly.Stallone has been outspoken about his current role in the “Rocky” franchise as a producer and also hinted that his current hit series “Tulsa King” may be among his final acting roles. Stallone confirmed he is writing and potentially directing the “Tenderloin” TV show, developed alongside “Yellowstone” director and executive producer Stephen Kay, plus an Edgar Allen Poe biopic titled “Poe.”“But I doubt the acting aspect of it,” Stallone told IndieWire of his roles in either project. “I think this might be my swan song,” in reference to Taylor Sheridan’s “Tulsa King.”“Sly” comes on the heels of the Netflix three-part docuseries “Arnold” about Stallone’s competitor and acting counterpart, Arnold Schwarzenegger.“We really disliked each other immensely because we were… this may sound a little vain, but I think we were pioneering a kind of genre at that time and it hasn’t been seen since really,” Stallone said of Schwarzenegger in the 1980s. “So the competition, because it’s his nature, he is very competitive and so am I… and I just thought it actually helped, but off-screen we were still competitive and that was not a healthy thing at all, but we’ve become really good friends.”The duo starred in “The Expendables” and “Escape Plan” together, with Stallone recently admitting that Schwarzenegger may have been the “superior” action star.“I had to get my ass kicked constantly, whereas Arnold, he never got hurt much,” Stallone said. “And I’m going, ‘Arnold, you could go out and fight a dragon and you’d come back with a Band-Aid.'”“Sly” premieres in November on Netflix.

        "title": "Barbie: Impossible and Indiana Oppenheimer: July Box Office Needs a Hero",
        "content": "July, the season of fireworks, vacations, and light-hearted blockbusters, represents this summer’s last shot at a $100 million opening. It will also determine if box office has a shot at improving on last year’s $3.4 billion total.“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” (Disney) opens tomorrow, “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” (Paramount) is July 12, and “Barbie” (Warner Bros. Discovery) and “Oppenheimer” (Universal) are July 19. All are expected to open to at least $50 million; $100 million is not entirely unrealistic, but it may be unlikely. All told, the month could represent anywhere from $1 billion to as much as $1.4 billion.Going in, the hope was a $4 billion summer — an 18 percent improvement above the 2022 total of just under $3.4 billion. So far, the improvement is 3.5 percent, on track for $3.5 billion. Even that isn’t guaranteed, although there’s hope that August will represent a significant improvement over a very weak 2022.The June estimate is slightly over $1 billion, a four percent uptick from last year. “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” (Sony) contributed about a third of this, followed at some distance by “The Little Mermaid” (Disney) and “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” (Paramount), both of which grossed over $100 million in June. “The Flash” (WBD) and “Elemental” (Disney) will both reach $100 million, but their sluggish trajectories hurt the month’s performance.Opening-day grosses for “Indiana Jones” will go on the June ledger, with the bulk of its run in July. At this point, opening projections are no better than $70 million. That would be disappointing: Its production budget is $100 million more than “The Flash,” which opened to an underwhelming $55 million.“Mission: Impossible” should be the month’s best performer as well as the best long-term bet. However, current tracking places its opening under $100 million. At this point, it may not challenge “Spider-Verse” for the summer’s #1 title; it’s headed toward $400 million domestic.“Oppenheimer” will not open to $100 million and “Barbie” is a longshot, but they’re non-franchise titles without clear multi-quadrant appeal; it’s more important to consider their longer-term prospects.Both have intense interest, although “Oppenheimer” could suffer from the same premium-screen syndrome that depressed initial grosses for “Avatar: The Way of Water” last December. Marketing emphasizes the superiority of the biggest-possible screens, particularly IMAX. That limits seating, as does three-hour running time.“Barbie” has particularly strong female appeal, perhaps skewing a bit older. It’s unclear what it will offer other audiences, although its marketing promises that “If you love Barbie, this movie is for you… if you hate Barbie, this movie is for you.” (No word on what it does for those who don’t have strong feelings either way.)The guess is “Barbie” will have the bigger opening that is more likely to top $50 million. Both films have budgets around $100 million, far below “Mission: Impossible” — yet another pegged around $300 million.Other wide openings include “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken” (Universal) tomorrow, “Insidious: The Red Door” (Sony) and “Joy Ride” (Lionsgate) July 7, then at the end of the month Disney’s “Haunted Mansion” and A24’s horror title “Talk to Me,” both July 28.We figure the holdovers will add $225 million to the month’s total; all other new films, perhaps another $75 million. July last year took in $1.133 billion, the best month post-COVID. There’s a strong chance this July won’t improve on that, although the potential should be there for at least $1.2 billion. That would be only six percent over 2022 and raise the season to about five percent ahead.It’s a tall order to hope that the top titles and other new releases will gross reach $900 million in July. It will take everything working at full tilt for this to happen.With the prospects of production delays due to the WGA and potential SAG strikes, a summer release schedule that has fallen short, and general concern around the viability of comic-book movies, a lot is at stake. At this point, we know theaters are central to achieving all-platform success; what’s in question is whether the high expense of making and launching these titles makes financial sense.",

        "title": "Alan Arkin Dead at 89: Actor Was a Comic Great from ‘The Russians Are Coming’ to ‘Argo’",
        "content": "Acting legend Alan Arkin is dead at age 89. His publicist confirmed the news to IndieWire.The Oscar, Tony, Emmy, BAFTA, SAG, and Golden Globe winner passed away at his home.Perhaps best known for his roles in “Glengarry Glen Ross” and “Little Miss Sunshine,” for which he won a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award, Arkin began his acting career in 1957 — and ended up with a body of work of startling range. Arkin was an early member of the Second City comedy troupe and starred on Broadway with his Tony-winning turn in 1963’s “Enter Laughing.”His film breakout was via comedy as well: in his first major onscreen role in Norman Jewison’s 1967 Cold War caper “The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming” he plays the “political officer” on a Soviet submarine that runs aground on a small New England island of only 200 residents. The sub’s captain, too embarrassed to radio the motherland for help, sends a nine-person away-team to the island to try to get help there: a trawler, perhaps, that can dislodge them from the rocks. Arkin plays his political officer character, a fanatic, with true borscht-and-balalaika relish. When a little boy behind a screendoor at his house thinks Arkin is not to be trusted, Arkin menacingly slides two fingers down the screen in a failed attempt to act fatherly — think Sacha Baron Cohen as Erran Morad. Arkin received his first Oscar nomination for Best Actor for the role.Arkin leveraged that menace outright in “Wait Until Dark” as a black-leather clad drug dealer who’s convinced that Audrey Hepburn, who plays a blind woman, has his extremely valuable stash of drugs in her possession. Based on a play, it’s a one-room thriller that Arkin lords over with god-like villainy.By 1968, Arkin replaced Peter Sellers as Inspector Jacques Clouseau in the “Pink Panther” films and showed his dramatic chops in an Oscar-nominated performance for “The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter.” The role earned Arkin a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor.Arkin frequently collaborated with director Mike Nichols, both for play “Luv” and later film “Catch-22.” Arkin’s comedic side was central in his directorial debut “Little Murders” starring Elliott Gould. Arkin went on to direct the Broadway production of Neil Simon’s “The Sunshine Boys” for which he received a Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play nomination.Arkin’s TV career included roles in “St. Elsewhere” and “The Muppet Show” across the 1980s. He later received two Emmy wins for “The Kominsky Method” in 2018 and 2019 (and his final appearance on screens big or small was in a 2021 “Kominsky” episode), as well as lent his voice to “BoJack Horseman.”Famous film roles additionally include cult favorite “Gattaca,” “America’s Sweethearts,” “Grosse Point Blank,” “Mother Night,” and “The Pentagon Papers.”Arguably, Arkin’s greatest career highlight was his 2006 turn as a wise-cracking grandfather in indie film “Little Miss Sunshine” co-starring Abigail Breslin, Toni Collette, Steve Carell, and Paul Dano. Arkin made history as the then-sixth oldest winner of the Best Supporting Actor Oscar at age 72. It had been 37 years since his previous nomination. He said during his Oscar acceptance speech that he was “deeply moved by the open-hearted appreciation our small film has received, which in these fragmented times speaks so openly of the possibility of innocence, growth, and connection.”Arkin went on to receive his fourth Oscar nomination with Ben Affleck’s “Argo.” Arkin also published multiple novels and memoirs.",

        "title": "‘Nimona’ Review: This Shapeshifting Queer Love Story Hates Authoritarianism in All Its Forms",
        "content": "Medieval fiefdoms and dystopian surveillance states have never been known as bastions of civil liberties. So when someone had the bright idea to combine the two, it was only a matter of time before an innocent man got framed.“Nimona” begins with an accolade ceremony that Chaucer could have written. Ballister Boldheart (Riz Ahmed) is the first solider in his kingdom’s history to achieve knighthood without having descended from noble blood. Everyone agrees that he earned the position through merit and hard work — especially his dreamy boyfriend Ambrosius Goldenloin (Eugene Lee Yang).But this isn’t your grandfather’s feudal state — Nick Bruno and Troy Quane’s animated fantasy takes place in a world that splits the difference between “The Canterbury Tales” and “Tron.” Steel swords and suits of armor coexist alongside smartphones and flying cars, and the city-state is governed by medieval customs despite everyone having access to YouTube. One modern practice that hasn’t made its way inside the city walls? Laser safety protocols.When Ballister kneels before the Queen to be knighted, a laser gun that was inexplicably planted on him goes off and kills her. Our hero goes from the toast of the kingdom to a criminal pariah before he even has time to realize what happened. And that’s just the prologue!Left without a title or a boyfriend, Ballister can barely muster the motivation to clear his good name. That’s where Nimona (Chloë Grace Moretz) comes in. The rebellious pink shapeshifter — don’t you dare call her a monster — has been waiting her entire life for an adventure. When she hears that the kingdom’s golden boy has suffered a fall from grace, she suspects that he might need a sidekick to help him get his mojo back.While Nimona usually takes the form of a pink-haired pre-teen girl who looks like she’s gonna be in for a treat when she discovers pop punk, she can turn herself into just about anything. Need a giant pink rhinoceros to bust you out of prison? She’s the girl you call. Does the situation call for a more nuanced impression of a real person? She can do that, too.The two unlikely friends team up to prove Ballister’s innocence, but her burn-it-all-down ethos clashes with his institutionalist sensibilities. Even when evidence reveals who framed him, the knight won’t go public with it out of fear that it could hamper public trust in the government. He’s determined to rebuild his life by playing by the old rules, while she’s convinced that the only way to happiness is starting from scratch.The fictional authoritarian government touches on a multitude of contemporary issues with varying skillfulness. (Homophobia doesn’t appear to be a major problem in this kingdom, but the regime’s treatment of shapeshifters stands in as a convenient allegory for it.) But no matter what arguments Ballister makes in favor of law and order, Nimona persuasively refutes him with her calls to look out for the little guy.Ballister isn’t the only knight beginning to question the system. Ambrosius is still doing his duty as a loyal servant of the crown — which primarily consists of hunting down his former boyfriend and trying to throw him back in jail. But he just can’t wrap his mind around the idea that the gentle soul he fell in love with would kill a queen. As Nimona’s fieriness pushes the city’s guardrails to their breaking point, the two knights appear well-positioned to decide the fate of the monarchy.“Nimona” unfolds in a storybook animation style that blends the ancient and futuristic influences into a singular story. The film is never afraid to follow its characters into dark places, eschewing convenient answers in favor of the bittersweet realities of life. And rather than force fans to read between the lines, the gay romance that forms its emotional core is given room to flourish in plain sight.What could have been a generic piece of standard Netflix fare in less skillful hands ends up being a nuanced story of belonging that’s slightly less cliche-ridden than you might expect. Ballister’s romance with Ambrosius and his platonic friendship with Nimona unfold concurrently, but they build towards a single point: each individual soul is worth exploring, and no amount of law and order can justify giving that up.“Nimona” is now streaming on Netflix.",

        "title": "Margot Robbie’s Favorite Movies: 6 Films That Inspired the Actress’ Early Career",
        "content": "From Australian soap operas to working with some of the biggest names in the industry, Margot Robbie’s rise to stardom has only accelerated since her American film debut, “About Time,” in 2013. After three years of playing teenager “Donna Freedman” on the television show “Neighbours,” Robbie packed her bags and headed for Los Angeles where she would work on the ABC series “Pan Am,” playing a 1960s stewardess. The period dramedy was not renewed for a second season, but would mark Robbie’s final TV role pre-movie stardom.The actress grew up with admiration for actors Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio, and has since shared the big screen with both of them. Robbie first gained serious industry attention playing Naomi Lapaglia — the bombastic wife to DiCaprio’s scammy stockbroker character in Martin Scorsese’s “The Wolf of Wall Street.” Only a few years later, Robbie would receive Oscar nominations for her work playing other unmissable women, as Tonya Harding in “I, Tonya” and a Fox news correspondent in “Bombshell.” (Robbie is still on the hunt for her first Oscar win).Knowing she wanted to make a career in front of the camera early on, Robbie was inspired by film at a young age, often reenacting movies in front of her parents as a kid. Growing up in a rural Dalby, Queensland community, her family never imagined a career in acting. “My family has no connection to the entertainment industry whatsoever, so when I started acting, everyone was like, ‘that’s fun, but when are you going to actually get a real job?’” Robbie said to British Vogue.In honor of Robbie’s starring and producing role in the upcoming “Barbie,” below are movies she has publicly praised — listed in no particular order. An adventure-filled parody, “Robin Hood: Men in Tights” is one of Robbie’s childhood favorites. With a star-studded cast, including one of the earliest performances from Dave Chappelle, the actress couldn’t get enough of it, remembering the days she watched the movie on repeat.“Upon reflection, it was just filled with innuendo and it was probably quite inappropriate for a five-year-old to be quoting,” Robbie said to BAFTA. A spoof on the noble thief legend of Robin Hood, the idea for the film stems from a pitch Beverly Hills dentist, Evan Chandler, made to his client, screenwriter J. David Shapiro. Shapiro went on to recruit and co-author a screenplay for “Men in Tights” with Chandler, which was directed by comedian Mel Brooks. No matter how high you reach in the ranks of Hollywood, fangirling over Brad Pitt will never go out of style. That is no different for Robbie, whose admiration for Pitt’s character Floyd in “True Romance” has not died down despite having worked with him on three films so far. The actress has noted the movie among her favorites of all time; its influence was even felt at Robbie’s wedding.“I walked down the aisle to the ‘True Romance’ music,” Robbie said to MTV News. She was still a toddler when Quentin Tarantino made his cinematic debut with “Reservoir Dogs,” but 28 years later Robbie came full circle, starring in his ninth and (supposedly) penultimate film “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.” A lifelong fan of his work, Robbie approached the director during her time on “Birds of Prey,” asking permission to use “Fox Force Five” as a working title for the film — a “Pulp Fiction” reference. Tarantino said yes, and the all-female group of superheroes organized by Harley Quinn used the “Fox Force Five” monicker during production.A comedic love story of a divorced woman who rekindles her relationship with her ex-husband after playing the field, “The Philadelphia Story” is Robbie’s favorite old Hollywood film. It was initially scripted as a Broadway play, and revived Katherine Hepburn’s career after she acquired the film rights from producer Howard Hughes. Action, comedy, drama, adventure. The diversity of “The Fifth Element” was fine tuned over the nine years it took to process and shoot. Set in the 23rd century, the movie brought unimaginable gadgets and artificial intelligence to life with no shortage of vibrant colors or novelty costumes to eye. Racking up a sizable $90 million budget during production, “The Fifth Element” was the most expensive European film in history at the time. What would have likely been an even heftier price tag for producers, the film was initially set to cast Prince in the role of Ruby Rhod before Chris Tucker was hired. One of Milla Jovovich’s earliest action performances, Robbie was captivated by her performance as Leeloo, remembering how influential the Leeloo was on her younger self. “I was just obsessed with ‘The Fifth Element’ and that character in particular,” Robbie said, reciting a scene from the movie to BAFTA.The first film Robbie ever saw in theaters, “George of the Jungle” was a childhood favorite for the fledgling actress — who is still a fan of the King of Swing decades later. Raised by apes in an African jungle, George finds a love that leads him to San Francisco. Though it received mixed reviews from critics, Disney greenlit a sequel without Brendan Fraser years later in addition to the 2007 animated series. “I watched it a lot as a kid, I loved that film,” Robbie said to BAFTA. “I’ve been a Brendan Fraser fan ever since. I haven’t watched it in quite a few years though, I should revisit it.”",

        "title": "A Brief History of Hollywood Writers’ Strikes",
        "content": "The ongoing Writers Guild of America strike, which brought Hollywood to a screeching halt in May, comes at a once-in-a-generation inflection point for the entertainment industry.A decade of changes in viewing habits has resulted in a consumer base that wants to watch more content, but pay for less of it — and do so primarily on their own schedules without leaving the house. Hollywood’s pivot to streaming created a brief gold rush as legacy brands attempted to build up these subscriber bases with massive quantities of content. But the past year has slowly seen studios and networks come to the collective realization that their business model isn’t viable as it stands.The artists who actually make the content that fuels the Streaming Wars face an equally frustrating predicament. Streaming may have created more jobs in the short term, but it has eroded the residuals that once formed the bedrock of a writer’s income. Screenwriters are working more, earning less, and being asked to come to terms with the idea that their work can be removed from streaming circulation at any moment — and for any reason. The WGA went on strike with the intention of not just securing more resources for its members, but reaching a new understanding about the ways in which studios and artists can coexist in this unfamiliar and fraught era.In some ways, the current situation is unprecedented. But the story of Hollywood writers striking when technological innovations threaten their established income sources is not new. The WGA has gone on strike eight times since forming in 1933, most recently in 2007. Many of the strikes were tied to emerging technologies that threatened to fundamentally alter the way Hollywood distributes entertainment — and were ultimately resolved once the guild felt that writers had been assured an appropriately-sized slice of the new pie.Anyone looking for clarity about the current ambiguity facing Hollywood would be well advised to study the history of writers strikes. While streaming profitability (or the lack thereof) and artificial intelligence are uniquely 21st century problems, many of the previous strikes unfolded in similar ways. Keep reading for a chronological history of WGA strikes, including the ways that Hollywood resolved the first seven work stoppages — running alongside photos of the current actions still playing out in New York and Los Angeles.What was at stake: The very concept of residuals. The Screen Writers Guild — which would later split and become the bifurcated east/west coast Writers Guild of America in 1954 — joined powers with the Authors League of America two years earlier to demand royalties (later known as residuals) and secure better ownership over their work. The unions went on strike against the Alliance of Television Film Producers for 14 weeks, and fought for residuals based on a percentage of overall project earnings; as well as to retain rights to their work in an evolving landscape of reruns, remakes, and sequels.What was the outcome: The agreement that ended the 1952 strike gave writers unprecedented ownership over their stories and scripts; in some instances, capping studio ownership of writers’ work (renewal notwithstanding). Together, the two unions made history by establishing residuals for TV writers. But they were forced to concede to a percentage of the original price paid: a flat-fee not adjusted for project success. —AFWhat was at stake: Employment benefits, and residuals for theatrical projects rereleased on TV. At the same time that Ronald Reagan was leading the 1960 Screen Actors Guild strike, the WGA went up against the ATFP for a second time on pay — this time focusing on the pipeline from theaterical showings to televised reruns. The union also sought better job benefits for writers, proposing independent pension and health care plans.What was the outcome: The WGA won residuals for films rereleased on television, as well as established a writers’ pension fund. Studios also agreed to participation in an industry health care system. —AFWhat was at stake: Compensation from the still-emerging home video market. VHS players weren’t even in homes when the WGA struck the Association of Motion Picture and Television Producers over the emerging technology in 1973. Writers demanded compensation for video cassettes and paid TV in the first of numerous WGA actions about the distribution issues of this era.What was the outcome: The writers successfully secured residuals on video cassettes and paid television, as well as established an independent health fund for the guild and set up incremental salary increases for writers on longer projects. —AFWhat was at stake: Everything the 1973 strike predicted. Actors walked off the job in the summer of 1980, when SAG and AFTRA combined forced to demands performers receive increased pay and a better kickback from video cassettes and paid television. Those same issues would inspire the WGA to strike for 13 weeks the following year, with a focus on residuals from cable television.What was the outcome: The cascading industry walkoffs between 1980 and 1981 significantly delayed television. And while the WGA secured some of what it sought (with a fixed percentage of the distributor’s gross earnings from rereuns going to writers), the 1981 strike would portend a decade of back-and-forth between writers and studios. —AFWhat was at stake: As Hollywood began to wrap its arms around the windfall created by home video sales, writers went on strike in an attempt to obtain a larger percentage of the profits. The key dispute revolved around where the money was coming from: a film’s screenwriters typically received a percentage of producers’ royalties, but the guild went on strike in an attempt to wet its beak from the much larger pool of VHS revenue that distributors received.What was the outcome: The strike was resolved within two weeks, with the WGA quickly agreeing to drop the VHS issue in favor of a fairly standard 6% raise in wages and increased health benefits. The controversial outcome was seen by many as a Band-Aid on a larger dispute that remained unsolved. —CZWhat was at stake: When the three year collective bargaining agreement reached in 1985 expired, the WGA embarked on a strike aimed at securing larger residuals for syndicated television shows. Growing domestic and international markets created new demand for reruns of existing shows, but studios compensated writers via a percentage-based system that many felt was susceptible to dishonest accounting practices. The guild sought to replace the sliding scale with a fixed method of compensation.What was the outcome: The strike lasted from March 7 through August 7 and resulted in $500 million in lost revenue for studios. Writers and studios eventually compromised on syndication royalties, with the percentage-based compensation system remaining in place while writers received higher fees for reruns in international markets. The four year deal also gave new creative protections to writers who sold original film scripts. However, the strike was credited with significantly decreasing TV audiences, as many popular shows were unable to rebuild fan enthusiasm after long hiatuses. —CZWhat was at stake: Revenue from the internet. While streaming was still in its infancy 2007 — Netflix launched its online viewing platform less than a year before the WGA strike — writers and studios were beginning to fight about profits from the next frontier in film distribution. Savvy writers also saw the writing on the wall about the direct-to-streaming content that would eventually be produced, and sought to have standard union rules followed on what was then referred to as “new media.”What was the outcome: After a 100 day strike that lasted from November 2007 to February 2008, the WGA and AMPTP laid the groundwork for the existing Internet distribution landscape. The new collective bargaining agreement found a mutually acceptable revenue sharing system for online movie rentals and ad-supported streaming of existing shows on network websites. More importantly, the union gained jurisdiction over shows produced for streaming services, ensuring that Netflix and Amazon original series followed the same production and compensation procedures as shows on cable. —CZWhat was at stake: The viability of TV writing as a career in the streaming age. With royalties dwindling, artificial intelligence threatening to replace (or at least supplement) human writers, and streaming services rapidly purging their content libraries and occasionally preventing completed projects from being released, the WGA launched a strike with the hope of creating a “new normal” that would allow writers to continue to earn a living. Many expected the strike to be tied to similar work stoppages from Hollywood directors and actors, but the Directors Guild of America recently reached a new deal to avert a strike. SAG-AFTRA has until June 30 to reach a deal of its own before actors begin striking.What was the outcome: The Writers Guild of America authorized a strike on May 3, 2023. As of this writing, it has yet to be resolved. Virtually all major TV series have halted production — some attempted to continue shooting with scripts written before the strike, but complications involving producing duties performed by WGA members rendered that virtually impossible. —CZ",

        "content": "Arnold Schwarzenegger is crediting James Cameron with seeing the future.During a recent Q&A with Arnold Schwarzenegger (via People magazine), he applauded Cameron’s 1984 film “Terminator” for predicting the rise of artificial intelligence. The actor shared that the plot of “Terminator” has essentially “become a reality” thanks to modern technology.“Today, everyone is frightened of it, of where this is going to go,” Schwarzenegger said. “And in this movie, in ‘Terminator,’ we talk about the machines becoming self-aware and they take over.”The “Fubar” star continued, “Now over the course of decades, it has become a reality. So it’s not any more fantasy or kind of futuristic. It is here today. And so this is the extraordinary writing of Jim Cameron.”Schwarzenegger added of the “Titanic” Oscar winner, “He’s just such an extraordinary writer and he’s such an unbelievable director, this is again, one of those things that I wish I could take credit for this movie. I can only take credit of the character that I played and the way I played it. But I mean, he has created this character. He has written it so well, he’s written the movie so well, and that’s why he is, you know, the number one director in the world.”Schwarzenegger, who has appeared in six of the “Terminator” franchise films, revealed earlier this year that he will not be back as the titular assassin. His final appearance in the role was for 2019’s “Terminator: Dark Fate.”“The franchise is not done. I’m done,” Schwarzenegger said. “I got the message loud and clear that the world wants to move on with a different theme when it comes to ‘The Terminator.’ Someone has to come up with a great idea…The first three movies were great. Number four [‘Salvation’] I was not in because I was governor. Then five [‘Genisys’] and six [‘Dark Fate’] didn’t close the deal as far as I’m concerned. We knew that ahead of time because they were just not well-written.”",

The Directors Guild reached a deal with the AMPTP to avoid a strike; however, SAG contract negotiations are still underway.The “Trading Places” director continued, “The sentiment really is the sorrow for the pathetic state the business is in. You know, between streaming and the pandemic, it was like a stake through the heart. It really hurts the business and continues to do so. And there’s the strike now. The streamers really are the bad guys.”Landis added that streaming platforms take away from the overall film experience.“Motion pictures are meant to be seen in a large house, cinema, a big theater, on a big screen, with good sound and as many people as possible because it’s a communal experience,” the “Animal House” filmmaker said.Due to the current WGA strike, “everything is in sort of limbo” with Landis’ personal upcoming projects despite him being “desperate to work.” Landis confirmed an upcoming Broadway show, plus two feature films and a TV series in the works.",

        "title": "President Trump’s Muslim Ban Cost Golshifteh Farahani Her Role in ‘After Yang’",
        "content": "If only “After Yang” were made after Donald Trump‘s presidency.The Kogonada film, which was critically ranked as one of the best movies of 2022, debuted at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival before playing in the Spotlight section at Sundance. The film centers on family’s android Yang (Justin H. Min), whose malfunctions lead to a philosophical debate as the parents, played by Colin Farrell and Jodie Turner-Smith, reconnect with their own humanity.Iranian-French “Extraction” actress Golshifteh Farahani revealed during a TikTok video for Elle that she was originally cast in the female lead role, but due to President Trump’s travel ban, Turner-Smith replaced her.When asked by Elle if she had ever been “disappointed” to lose a role, Farahani responded, “Yes, I have lost two roles that both of them, they hurt me really badly. One of them was ‘Prince of Persia.’ It was when the government of Iran took my passport and they didn’t let me leave and that led to my exile. It was the most traumatic time of my life. And then the second one, again, it was another movie with Colin Farrell that I was supposed to do.”She added, “I was so looking forward to working with him and because of President Trump. I have a French passport but my visa took much longer than it used to take because I am born in Iran and I also couldn’t make it to that shooting. So two times for political reasons, I lost two roles. Maybe I’m not attached to those stories but the fact that I couldn’t go because of politics hurt me very badly.”“After Yang” director Kogonada told IndieWire that the subject of race was key to the portrayal of AI Yang.“This robot was a construct of Asian-ness. I could deeply relate to this idea that he wasn’t really Asian, but he existed as an Asian and wanted that as well,” Kogonada said. “And maybe he was too, you know, maybe he was like just getting to the essence of what that even means. It was such a short, lovely, well-told story, but I could see the promise of it being the kind of film that I would want to watch. It had that sort of seed and promise of something that felt like it could be cinematic. And I also loved a sci-fi world that was domestic. The stakes weren’t about saving the world, but it was about getting through a day, and getting through weeks and months.”",

        "title": "Gotham Lays Off Longtime Awards Staff and Cancels Project Market",
        "content": "The Gotham Film and Media Institute laid off two key staffers this week after canceling the Project Market, where seminal indie breakouts from “Clerks” to “Moonlight” have gathered early financial resources, for the first time in its 45-year history. The Project Market, formerly known as the Independent Feature Film Market, was called off after the Gotham was informed by the WGA that writers would be in violation of their contract with the union if they participated in the event. Senior programming director Milton Tabbot, who has worked at the organization since 1996, was let go along with director of narrative programming Zach Mandinach. Tabbot and Mandinach were the core staff responsible for managing the Project Market, while Tabbot more recently oversaw the juries for the nominees of the organization’s signature event, the Gotham Awards. In a statement scheduled to go out to Gotham members Friday, the organization said Tabbot and Mandinach “have built a lasting legacy as ardent supporters of independent creators in the film and media industry which they will continue to do in future endeavors.” Over the course of his nearly 30-year history with the Gotham, Tabbot has been one of the most visible figures of the organization, leading initiatives such as the Documentary Feature Labs and Gotham Fiscal Sponsorship in addition to his oversight of the Gotham Awards.Gotham executive director Jeff Sharp had no further comment, but sources tell IndieWire that planning for the Gotham Awards has been distributed to other members of its 14-person staff, as the organization maps out contingency plans for the show in light of the WGA strike. (Tabbot is in talks to remain involved with the awards planning in a part-time capacity.) The 2023 ceremony is currently scheduled for Monday, November 27, taking its usual spot as the first awards show of Oscar season. While the critics and journalists involved in the nominating process sometimes select low-budget or otherwise marginalized work that could have a harder time resonating at other awards shows, the ceremony can also provide an early boost for outside-the-box awards season hopefuls, as it did last year for Best Film winner “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” (Disclosure: I participated in several of these committees over the years, but not since 2019.)While the WGA strike will impact many awards shows if it continues through the season, as the first one on the calendar the Gothams are most vulnerable to repercussions if the strike continues into the fall. That scenario grows even more complicated if SAG-AFTRA strikes. In 2021, the Gotham Awards delayed the ceremony until January due to the pandemic, and sources tell IndieWire that such a scenario has been discussed if the strike continues.  Regardless of what happens in awards season, however, filmmakers are still attempting to raise financing for new projects of various sizes. IndieWire learned that the Gotham received a record 1,000 projects submitted to the market this year, and provided a refund on submission fees in excess of $50,000 after the Institute canceled the event. The Gotham will still host a series of panel discussions and screenings with IndieWire sister brand Variety for the Variety Gotham Week on October 2-6. Corporate sponsors such as Amazon and Netflix that have previously supported the market are now involved in the new event (the organization receives 90 percent of its support from corporate sponsorship). This outcome raises questions about the status of other U.S. market events, including AFM, which runs October 31 – November 5, and Film Independent’s Fast Track Film Finance event, set to take place in November.Meanwhile, the Gotham layoffs coincided with this week’s news that the Sundance Institute has laid off six percent of its staff. While international market such as Berlin’s EFM and the Marché du Film in Cannes receive government subsidies, U.S. market events have no such government support — and, unlike during the pandemic, there will be no PPE loans anytime soon.

        "content": "Filmmaker Nicole Holofcener understands why women-focused film panels are still needed, due to the continued under-representation of women behind the camera —  which she herself alluded to on just such a panel at the Nantucket Film Festival this past weekend — but she still hopes that the day will come when women-focused film panels can stop.“I’m very grateful to be here,” Holofcener said during the panel, titled “Women Behind the Words,” and which also included Allison Williams and Michaela Watkins as fellow panelists. “And I’m very proud to be a woman, but I feel like that has to stop. We have to stop this. We’re just actors and writers and performers.”Those remarks were prompted by the panel’s moderator, Ophira Eisenberg, saying that, in the industry, “There’s this feeling that you’re going to be judged first as a woman and second as a writer or director or artist.”Holofcener later added, “It’s like, we wouldn’t say ‘Jews Behind the Words,’ right? That would be offensive.” (Holofcener herself is Jewish, as is Eisenberg, who immediately quipped about that panel title suggestion, “Maybe for Yom Kippur or something.”)When asked about what gravity she feels regarding the representation of women onscreen, Holofcener said, “I don’t think like that because I would probably be paralyzed if I had that kind of feeling of responsibility. No, I’m just writing stuff that I enjoy and about characters that inspire me and interest me and I think are making a story good.”Holofcener is sensitive to the dismissive ways with which women directors have been treated in the industry, though, recalling an incident in her life when a prominent industry insider told her to give up writing.“I made a short film that was bad and we saw it and he said, ‘Maybe quit the directing thing.’ Or actually, ‘Do the directing thing, quit the writing.’ I could tell you his name. I mean, we remember these people for the rest of our lives,” she said. “And I was an usher or whatever at the New York Film Festival. So I was backstage with Jim Jarmusch, who was a huge inspiration to me and an idol, and I then went to him and I said, ‘Do you have any advice?’ And he said, ‘Don’t give up.’ That was it. And I didn’t.”She does think there was a turning point regarding women-focused storytelling, however. “The moment that I feel like things really changed for women in entertainment was with the movie ‘Bridesmaids,'” she said. “And I remember sitting in the audience at [SXSW] and watching it with an audience and thinking, ‘This is going to be huge.’ And after that movie, the question of, ‘Can women be as funny as men?’ — which I got a lot — that question was eviscerated and nobody ever asked it again. And I don’t know why it was ever asked in the first place. It’s so stupid. But it was, a lot. But I think that movie, after that, it just stopped. Nobody asked that anymore.”",

        "title": "‘Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken’ Review: ‘Turning Red’ Takes to the Seas for Familiar Monster Adventure",
        "content": "Audiences might bemoan the lack of original thinking at the movies these days — all those sequels, remakes, and reboots! — but even new ideas can feel suddenly played out when faced with the horrifying specter of parallel thinking. Consider everything from “Deep Impact” and “Armageddon” to “Dante’s Peak” and “Volcano,” “Capote” and “Infamous” to “No Strings Attached” and “Friends with Benefits,” and those are just contemporary examples of the phenomenon. If you’ve got an idea for a movie — hopefully, a good one to boot — chances are, someone else has it, too. And they may even have it at the exact same time.Such is the case with Kirk DeMicco and Faryn Pearl’s “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken,” which arrives on the heels (fins? paws?) of some very similar other animated adventures, like Pixar’s superior “Turning Red” and the studio’s less thrilling entry “Luca,” both of which use monstrous imagery to explore puberty and coming-of-age. No, literally monstrous: In “Turning Red,” a young girl’s maturation turns her into a giant panda (adorable, terrifying), while “Luca” follows a pair of young boys who discover they’re both sea monsters (in sun-drenched Italy, no less).For the DreamWorks-backed entry into the “whoa, puberty is nuts!” animated movie Mad Libs arena, those ideas get mashed up into something funny, sweet, and all-too-familiar. This time around, we’re following a delightful young girl (voiced by the winning Lana Condor) who can’t shake the feeling she’s different, only to discover on the eve of a key teenage experience that she very, very much is (she, too, is a sea monster). And while this concept, from writers DeMicco, Pam Brady, Elliott DiGuiseppi, and Brian C. Brown, might have felt fresh five years ago, in 2023, it’s just another example of parallel thinking damning even the cutest of ideas.And “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken” is cute.DeMicco and Pearl open with some splashy exposition, telling us that kraken, despite their bad reputations and terrifying name, are actually protectors of the ocean. Being a kraken? It’s a good thing! But that hasn’t stopped even the most lauded of kraken — like Ruby’s mom Agatha (voiced by Toni Collette, in just one of many excellent pieces of voice casting) — from sweeping her family onto dry shores (like their small town of Oceanside) and keeping everyone very much out of the ocean and away from their legacy as massive, butt-kicking sea monsters.Ruby (voiced by Condor) has always known she’s different — perhaps her blue skin and gilled ears are a tip-off — but even she doesn’t know just how different she is. That’s a tough load for any teenager to carry, but one that’s particularly hard for Ruby, who already feels torn between her love of order (she’s into math and rules) and her spunky and fun personality. While “Turning Red” was explicitly coded to be about puberty and periods and “Luca” has been viewed as a story about sexual and gender identity, “Ruby Gillman” flits between all these possible readings. In short, it’s about discovering who you are (be it physically, sexually, mentally, emotionally) and harnessing the bravery to embrace it. A classic tale in sea monster form.One thing Ruby has always understood: She can’t go in the ocean, ever. (Then why did they move to Oceanside, you may wonder? As Agatha tells us in one of the film‘s most clever and amusing moments, they do still need to remain moist, obviously.) Ruby is just fine with that request until Oceanside High goes ahead and schedules their annual prom on a party boat, and all of Ruby’s best pals (rendered mostly in tropes: the wacky one, the gothic one, the dude one) can’t wait to literally splash out on the luxe vessel. But what about Ruby?Before you can say “promposal,” Ruby has tumbled into the ocean in an attempt to save her sweet crush Connor (voiced by Jaboukie Young-White) after he goes into the drink. It’s there that she discovers — care of some colorful animation, amusing character design, and a healthy dose of pop music — that she’s actually a massive kraken, and everything Agatha has told her is, well, kind of a massive lie.Much like “Turning Red,” the real heart of “Ruby Gillman” lies in the complicated bond between mother and daughter, one built on both very good intentions and totally traumatic deceptions. And when Ruby’s transformational news travels to both her Grandmamah (voiced by Jane Fonda) and the rest of the ocean’s many other inhabitants, that bond is going to be mightily tested. Who else in the ocean, you may ask? Her funny uncle Brill (voiced by Sam Richardson), who arrives at the Gillman home, along with hip new girl at school Chelsea Van Der Zee (voiced by Annie Murphy), who soon reveals herself to be an Ariel-styled mermaid who is thrilled to have a new water-logged pal (maybe).Partially spurred on by Chelsea and her instant popularity but mostly driven by her own desire to break free, Ruby starts spending more time in the ocean (read: more time as a kraken), where Grandmamah teaches her a ton about their heritage and lineage. Kraken? Sure, there’s plenty of them, but Grandmamah and Agatha and Ruby are the only giant kraken, fierce fighters and beloved royalty who are tasked with protecting the ocean from all the bad stuff, including (dramatic pause) mermaids, who are the real monsters. Oh, so what about Chelsea?Exposition and information dumps abound, but despite the seemingly overstuffed nature of the plot, “Ruby Gillman” skews a bit younger than similar cinematic options. It really soars (swims?) when it’s leaning into the lighter, literally more colorful stuff, like when Ruby goes full kraken and explores a lush, bright ocean alongside her grandmother or new best frenemy. The pop songs blare, the montages zip by, and the water setting is turned into something bright and fresh (sorry, new “Little Mermaid”), all setting the perfect stage for a warm and good-hearted story about self-acceptance.This may all seem familiar, and that’s both comforting and disappointing. Kids are always in need of gracious tales about the power of being yourself in a world not necessarily built to embrace differences (of all sizes, of all kinds) and stories like “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken” can do that, with fun to spare. But why not get more splashy, why not take more risks, why not get bigger and weirder, when that’s also the aim of the very story you’re telling? Audiences of all ages deserve those leaps, the more giant, the better.Universal Pictures will release “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken” in theaters on Friday, June 30.",

        "title": "We Know Where You Go After the Movies",
        "content": "I ate so much movie popcorn, I’m gonna explode — quick, where’s the nearest burger joint?Dinner and a movie — or more commonly, movie and a dinner — is alive and well. In a 2022 study of 1,000 U.S. moviegoers, movie-theater advertising company Screenvision Media and data analytics firm Screen Engine/ASI study found that 79 percent of respondents visited a restaurant or bar immediately before or after seeing a film in theaters.Like all good data, it gets more granular than that. Those companies also have a pretty good idea of where you’re eating and drinking — and the answer dovetails nicely with those ubiquitous ads that force-feed your attention before the previews. They may be long and loud, but you can’t say they don’t work.The tracking is easy, relatively speaking: Third-party companies like cloud-based location technology platform Foursquare data-mine your mobile ID, and if you’ve double opted-in to location-tracking on certain smartphone apps you’re their newest data point. (GasBuddy or certain weather apps are particular favorites.) Screenvision also works with M4, which gets its data from a panel that is arguably more aware of the location-based information being compiled and sold.Beyond where you are, what advertisers really want to do is influence why you go there. And the more you see an ad during Screenvision pre-feature show “Screenvision Front + Center” or NCM’s “Noovie,” the more you’re likely to visit one of the establishments advertised.Theatergoers may complain about being a captive audience for big-screen ads, but captive often translates to being engaged. When the screen is massive and the sound is inescapable, the theatergoer is often invested beyond their price of admission.Most moviegoers buy their tickets a day or more ahead of the showtime and travel an average of 11 miles from home to the theater, according to industry data. This is an audience “begging the screen to entertain them,” Jennifer Friedlander, VP of insights and measurement at Screenvision, told IndieWire. The result is high attention levels and recall rates.“There’s something that happens when you sit down, because you know you’re not going to be interrupted for two-plus hours,” Friedlander said. “You have a 40-foot screen in front of you, you’re ready to be entertained and engaged. And that’s where our advertising lives.”During the pre-show, including the ads, a movie-theater audiences’ eyes are on the big screen for about 23 seconds out of 30 seconds, or roughly 75 percent of the time, per an April 2023 Amplified Intelligence study. Compare that with the TV medium, in which eyes are only on the screen for 11 seconds (36 percent of the time for linear TV; 34 percent on streaming) of each half-minute commercial.The disparity in recall, or the ability to remember seeing a certain ad, is even wider. Over the past four years, movie-theater audiences had an average ad-recall rate of 72 percent, according to Screenvision data. The general consensus is TV ads have less than 20 percent recall.“We probably do push a little bit of activity,” Screenvision CEO John Partilla told IndieWire. While his ads likely “won’t make you run out and buy a car,” you will “go to the local margarita place” that was advertised ahead of the feature presentation.Movie ads also work on promoting major chains. Years ago, Friedlander said she worked with Applebees to place a theatrical ad targeted to its menu changes; the brand saw a 50 percent lift. More recently she worked with Starbucks; it found that after audiences were exposed to an ad for the coffee chain, those moviegoers went to a Starbucks 3 percent more often over the following four weeks.“For a brand like Starbucks that’s so well-penetrated, that’s huge,” Friedlander said.NCM, which is Screenvision’s chief rival and the larger of the two movie-theater advertising-sales companies, did not respond to IndieWire’s request for participation in this story.Movie theaters are happy to have the advertising revenue, which is split with an NCM or Screenvision, but they’d be even happier if those ads didn’t work. Exhibitors would love to be the ones that relieved you of your entire evening’s budget.According to Cinemark chief marketing and content officer Wanda Gierhart, 80 percent of their theaters have food and beverage options beyond standard concessions and 60 percent of them serve alcohol. AMC, the only theater chain larger than Cinemark in the U.S., did not immediately respond to our request for comparable statistics.“We’re big data people,” Gierhart said. “And we use all of that data to end up influencing all of our food and beverage offerings [and] our cocktail offerings.”",

        "content": "Timothée Chalamet is ready for war.The Oscar-nominated actor goes head-to-head with “Elvis” Academy Award-nominated breakout Austin Butler in Denis Villeneuve‘s “Dune: Part Two.” The epic ensemble cast also includes Zendaya reprising her role of Chani, along with Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Charlotte Rampling, and Javier Bardem.New cast members include Butler, Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken, Léa Seydoux, Souheila Yacoub, and Tim Blake Nelson — many of whom get a first or second look with this new trailer, below.Chalamet is back as Paul as he looks to lead the Fremen of Arrakis through war seeking vengeance for the death of his father. Director Villeneuve teased Butler’s key villain character at 2023 CinemaCon, calling him an “Olympic sword master crossed with a psychotic serial killer.” Butler is almost unrecognizable as a bald assassin boasting twin spears in the latest trailer.Villeneuve co-wrote the script with Jon Spaihts, adapting the second half of Frank Herbert’s sci-fi novel. “The Last of Us” showrunner Craig Mazin has a writing credit on “Dune: Part Two” after spending a month assisting on the script.Filming for the Warner Bros./Legendary sequel wrapped in December 2022. “Dune: Part Two” was shot entirely in IMAX by cinematographer Greig Fraser, who won the 2022 Oscar for “Dune: Part One.” The first film additionally took home Academy Awards for Best Sound, Visual Effects, Production Design, and Original Score. “Part Two” features entirely new sets for the city of Arrakis with practical elements.Unlike “Dune: Part One,” the sequel will solely have a theatrical release well ahead of PVOD and streaming. “Part One” had a day-and-date debut on Warner Bros. Pictures’ streamer HBO Max during its release amid the COVID-19 pandemic.“Dune: Part Two” premieres in theaters November 3. Check out the new trailer below.

        "title": "‘Scrapper’ Trailer: Harris Dickinson Shines in Charlotte Regan’s Sundance Breakout Debut",
        "content": "When it comes to adulthood (and parenthood), it’s hard not to just scrape by.Sundance breakout feature debut “Scrapper” centers on young father Jason, played by “Triangle of Sadness” star Harris Dickinson, who returns to London to reunite with his estranged 12-year-old daughter Georgie (Lola Campbell) following her mother’s (Olivia Brady) death. The film marks director Charlotte Regan’s feature debut.The father-daughter comedy follows Georgie (Campbell), a resourceful 12-year-old girl who secretly lives alone in her flat in a working-class suburb of London following the death of her mother. She makes money stealing bikes with her best friend Ali (Alin Uzun) and keeps the social workers off her back by pretending to live with an uncle. Out of nowhere, her estranged father Jason (Dickinson) arrives and forces her to confront reality. Uninterested in this sudden new parental figure, Georgie is stubbornly resistant to his efforts. As they adjust to their new circumstances, Georgie and Jason find that they both still have a lot of growing up to do.“Scrapper” was ranked among the best films out of 2023 Sundance in IndieWire’s critics survey, won the Grand Jury Prize at the festival, and landed U.S. distribution with Kino Lorber. The IndieWire review praised director Regan’s vision for having a certain “timelessness” when capturing the coming-of-age story between a father and daughter.“Although ‘Scrapper’ — and Georgie — have some rough edges, Regan’s film is remarkably gentle, without being schmaltzy,” the review reads. “Its wry observations are more effective than the big emotional swings ‘Scrapper’ sometimes, but not often, chooses to take. Because it’s a British debut by female director about a father-daughter relationship, ‘Scrapper’ has already been compared with Charlotte Wells’ terrific ‘Aftersun’ (mostly, of course, by those trying to sell the movie; almost any film should be so lucky). In truth, it’s almost nothing like it. Where ‘Aftersun’ uncomfortably probes emotional depths, ‘Scrapper’ stays wisely light of touch.”The review continues, “The softness of ‘Scrapper’ shouldn’t be mistaken for a lack of ambition on Regan’s part. Georgie and Jason just have a little less to worry about. Dickinson is wonderfully natural as a simple man with little to hide. Though it doesn’t strive for the dramatic highs and lows its actors could probably pull off, ‘Scrapper’ is a smart, sensitive debut and a promising arrival for its talented director.”“Scrapper” premieres August 25 via Kino Lorber in New York City at the IFC Center.

        "title": "Self-Taped Auditions Are Expensive, Controversial, and They Aren’t Going Anywhere",
        "content": "Vanessa Chester got a self-tape audition request for a role that sounded perfect. She asked an actress friend to run lines as she recorded herself, only to discover that her friend believed she’d just booked the same role. Through Chester, not the casting office, she learned that the production decided to go in another direction.Unhappy coincidence? Sure. It’s also one of the many reasons why the new standard of self-taping is more complicated and often more stressful than actors running between castings, LA traffic be damned.Self-tapes have their advantages: greater accessibility, wider pools of candidates, and chances for actors to edit and reset their performances. But while they were once an occasional ask, the pandemic made self-tapes the norm. Today, in-person auditions are the exception.Agents, managers, and actors have long used platforms like Breakdown Services and Talent Systems to find auditions. Today, those platforms are key hubs to upload self-tapes and have attracted major investors like RedBird Capital. Self-tapes have become an essential part of the Hollywood talent supply chain.It’s led to casting offices receiving many more submissions, and offering slightly more auditions for the same number of roles. Actors are sometimes asked to film themselves from multiple angles with expensive gear, or while driving, or Rollerblading.What actors might save on gas and parking tickets now goes toward the cottage industry of pop-up studios, or editing software. Actors also find they receive less feedback and must accommodate new demands.“The scale, volume, and the frequency in which actors are now being requested to audition is unsustainable,” said Chester, an actress best known for her roles in “The Lost World: Jurassic Park” and “Harriet the Spy.”“Sometimes I’m in my room yelling and screaming [for a self-tape] and I’m like, ‘My neighbors think I’m in a domestic violence situation right now.’ I don’t want to think about that when I’m supposed to be fully in the moment.”Days away from the expiration of its current contract, SAG-AFTRA is fighting for regulations around self-tape auditions as part of its AMPTP negotiations.“We’re not looking to go back to a world where self-tapes don’t exist,” SAG-AFTRA lead negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland told IndieWire prior to the start of the guild’s negotiations. (SAG-AFTRA agreed with the AMPTP to a media blackout). “To the contrary, self-tapes, when done correctly, can be a real advantage to our members in terms of access, accessibility, and opportunities for underrepresented groups.”That said, self tapes have also led to a rise in what Crabtree-Ireland called “abusive practices.” He wants “rules and regulations around how self-tapes are used to ensure that members aren’t asked to do things that are inappropriate, that self-tapes aren’t the only method being considered for projects, and that there is still a place in the industry for live auditions and for live virtual auditions where there’s real-time feedback.”In theory, it should be easier to audition from home. Candace Kita, an actress for over 30 years, says prior to Covid she spent “life in the car” and remembers the days of stopping in McDonald’s bathrooms in order to change outfits between auditions. Self-tapes allow her the chance to do multiple takes, edit, and adjust her performance within a time window rather than a one-and-done audition that could last all of 15 minutes.“You’re giving a performance of your overall capability,” Kita said. “I think we’re going on more auditions because casting directors have time to see more people. You’re up against more people, but I feel I can do a little better job, so I feel I have a little better opportunity.”And then there’s opportunity costs. Chester said she’s had to manage five different self-tapes due in a single day, along with an in-person audition across town, and juggling requests to dress for each role. Each self-tape means also finding someone to read with her for an hour or two, or pay for it at a studio, followed by editing each video before she can upload it.Since self-tapes operate without the boundaries of a casting office, or office hours, audition requests can arrive at 4 a.m. with a due date later that afternoon, or end-of-day Friday and due first thing Monday. For actors who can’t navigate the technology or child performers who still have to attend school, it can seem impossible.“Our hope was that this was a temporary fix to save the industry,” said a longtime SAG member who requested anonymity. “It was weird. We were going to tape from home, but everybody was going to do it because we were all navigating COVID together. Then it started to seem that a lot of those little temporary sacrifices really started to become permanent.”Others argue that these sorts of challenges are just part of the job and still beat paying for parking downtown or regretting not having your best moment when you’re in the room.“Auditions always come out of nowhere and they always scramble your life,” said Kevin Interdonato, an actor who has appeared on “The Sopranos” and the series “City on a Hill.” “That’s just par for the course whether it’s in-person or not. Sometimes you get a one-pager, sometimes you get nine pages.“I’m not going to complain about that stuff,” he said. “If the work is good and they like you, they’ll book you. You don’t need a fucking RED camera to book an audition.”While Chester is not on the current negotiating committee, she is on SAG-AFTRA’s LA local and national self-tape committees that provided some guidelines leading up to talks. One suggestion is page or scene limits on self-tapes. If a casting director can make up their mind within 30 seconds, why all the extra work?Barring that, actors want a minimum number of business days to turn around their tapes. The committees have also proposed software fixes to make sure actors’ tapes are being viewed, unskippable videos, no interns reviewing tapes, and viewing confirmations. Technology that marks something as played is already available for casting offices, but it could become viewable by agents and managers.The real fix might lie in a hybrid model that leans on self-tapes for smaller roles but mandates in-person auditions for larger ones. The anonymous actor described self-tapes as fine for finding “a barista who has five lines,” but in-person auditions establish a community and a relationship with casting directors.“There were these little chances of kismet that you would have by being in the room,” the actor said. “Especially when you’re a young actor, your job isn’t really to get the job; it’s to earn the trust of these casting directors. When you can feel that mechanism working for you in real time, it shows you what your job is. That is unquestionably something that is just missing from this.”Alexis Winter of AW Casting (“One Tree Hill,” “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”) said she is “hugely in favor” of regulations over things like page counts, adding that good casting directors don’t need (and won’t ask) you to spend money on elaborate equipment. She also recognizes that producers can make outsized asks that may need to be reigned in.“There’s very diplomatic conversations that we’re in control of with production,” Winter said. “That’s part of our job. Production doesn’t do casting. They don’t know. It’s our job to educate them and teach them, ‘This is a big ask, maybe we can do a little less.'”She insists that casting directors watch every tape that comes in (and knows most actors probably won’t believe her).“I’m very much on the actor’s side,” Winter said. “I want to make it as easy and as accessible for actors as possible, and I truly believe self-tapes are that. If we go back to a fully in-person model, it’s going to cut out a lot of developmental actors that already are probably more marginalized or have less access to the industry. The more actors can embrace technology moving forward, the easier it’s going to be for everyone.”Winter points to free services provided by the SAG-AFTRA Foundation and suggested tinkering with self-recorded audio tracks or even AI-readers. She’s surprised some actors lament not having the readers from the casting office because, in her experience, they’re not always the best scene partners.Winter fears some actors want casting directors to see fewer tapes and auditions to improve the odds. She may have a point — and so do the performers. Actor Thomas Ochoa said the game has changed, pointing to examples like Sony auditioning 700 actors for the co-lead opposite Jennifer Lawrence in “No Hard Feelings.”“None of the angst that is being expressed around how the process has changed is because we are upset that we’re competing against more performers,” they said. “The issue is that the amount of labor that we’re being asked to do as part of the process has increased, and… the chances of actually booking the role have decreased. It’s not that we’re trying to get a leg up on other actors. It’s just that the number of requests has increased so much, it’s turning what used to feel like part of the job into an actual lottery.”There’s another potential solution to self-tapes, one that SAG-AFTRA would rather not discuss: paying actors for auditions. Chester and Ochoa are founding members of Auditions Are Work (unaffiliated with SAG-AFTRA), a group of actors that is calling attention to language in the SAG-AFTRA contract dating back to 1947: It says actors should be paid half of a day rate for their auditions. The group formed in response to a statement the guild put out saying some prior interpretations of the language were ambiguous, outdated, and had a “lack of clarity.”Winter said she would love to see actors paid for auditions, but said that would come with an immediate downside.“I just don’t foresee that being beneficial to most actors,” she said. “Look, they’re trying to make it seem like every actor can all of a sudden get paid for auditions, and that’s just not what’s going to happen. It’ll be very few actors getting paid for auditions and less actors being seen, which harms the majority of actors. So the conversation I think is a bit immature where it is right now.”Chester acknowledged the controversy, but said it could eliminate the abuses of self-tapes, keep middle-class actors going, and even bring in ancillary revenue that boutique theatrical agencies need to stay afloat.“I would much rather be brought in 24 times a year and be paid for the ones that I didn’t book because I know that casting is saying, ‘We feel like you’re so viable and right for this role that we’re willing to pay you if we’re wrong,'” Chester said. “For me, audition pay being tied to scale is the only insurance right now that actors have for maintaining some type of economic viability in this business.”",

        "content": "Anthony Mackie is calling out Hollywood conglomerates amid a potential SAG-AFTRA strike on the heels of the WGA’s own.Since early May, the Writers Guild of America has placed a work-halt order for union members due to negotiations for fair wages and in response to the threat of A.I. entering writers’ rooms. The Directors Guild reached a deal with the AMPTP to avoid a strike; however, SAG contract negotiations in response to AI and streaming residuals are still underway.“It’s a shit show if we go on strike,” Mackie told Inverse, noting the only way to move forward is to find a fair deal between studios and the Guild. “They’re going to have to. Unless they get a bunch of fucking YouTubers to make ‘Avengers 5′!”The MCU actor continued, “Once the studios went public and were bought out by major companies, we were fucked. It’s no longer about art. It’s no longer about interesting, fun work. It’s about end-of-the-quarter profit sharing. It’s about shareholders. So you’re literally just raping and pillaging the industry. It’s cannibalism.”Mackie is starring in the next phase of the MCU, “Captain America: Brave New World,” which was formerly titled “Captain America: New World Order.” Mackie portrays Sam Wilson, the new Captain America after proving his heroism as Falcon.“There’s a huge amount of pressure,” Mackie said of leading the Marvel film. “You throw my dumb ass in the water, and you’re like, ‘Swim.’ I’m like, ‘Shit.’ But at the same time, it’s all in the state of mind. I’ve been given a great cast. I’ve been given a great group of people who I’ve worked with before.”Director Julius Onah helms “Brave New World,” which will have “all the flying, CGI, and all that shit,” Mackie promised. “That’s going to happen.”However, the star is still confused about the interconnected cinematic universe of Marvel.“I’m still trying to figure out the Marvel-verse, or whatever,” Mackie said about the MCU multiverse. “I don’t know. I don’t even know what the multiverse is. Dude, I have no idea what it is. I’m still trying to figure that shit out.”",

Glover was not initially among the announced cast list in September 2022 for the Peacock movie.“Donald’s coming back and that’s really important,” McHale said. “The fact that Donald’s going to do it, that was the big piece.

        "title": "Julian Sands and Not Believing in the Inevitable Until It Hits You in the Face ",
        "content": "The news that the remains of Julian Sands, an actor of extraordinary sensitivity and awareness, were identified in California’s San Gabriel mountains June 27 brings to a close a sad, uncertain chapter. Sands will have no date of death confirmed. He simply disappeared January 13 while hiking near Mt. Baldy amid severe storms, icy conditions, and possible avalanches. It took five days just to find his car. And yet, the location where he disappeared, a harsh wilderness, was only about 10 miles from Inland Empire urban sprawl. That’s California for you: the most densely populated areas abut what is truly “the wild.”The nature of his disappearance was such that many of Sands’ admirers, myself included, did not grieve his loss at the time. There was always hope, however much of a long shot, that he might be found. He was an expert and avid hiker, after all. Maybe he found some shelter or rigged his own, and was just cut off. By January 25, however, his brother Nick Sands told the BBC, “I have come to terms with the fact he’s gone and for me that’s how I’ve dealt with it.”Sands’ death is not just a tragedy, but a terrible loss for the arts. Though from Yorkshire, his long, thin face and lank build didn’t look strictly English. He easily played a Russian separatist character on the fifth season of “24” in 2006 — he was trying to assassinate the president of Russia, who in the universe of that show, was someone other than Vladimir Putin.Villains came easily to Sands. One of his last major roles was as a pedophile in the miserable-ist chic WWII drama “The Painted Bird,” considered one of the most brutal films of recent vintage. Though that was an arthouse film and Venice premiere, Sands spent a good part of his career in outright genre roles — especially horror movies such as “Warlock,” “Arachnophobia,” and Dario Argento’s “The Phantom of the Opera.” Whenever he wore his hair long, it underscored an absolute shock that he wasn’t cast in “Interview with the Vampire.”His genre work is one thing. It’s his romantic, mercurial turn in his breakout film, “A Room with a View,” that most people will picture immediately when they think of Sands. As George Emerson, an English youth from an upwardly mobile middle-class family (“I’m on the railways” George simply says of his profession), he’s coiled, tense, naïve, energetic — and given to unique responses like, in one fluid motion, falling to his knees in a simulation of prayer when accosted by a peddler in a Florentine cathedral. Sands’ George is a character whose inner life emanates from his pores, and it’s not hard to understand why young Englishwoman abroad Lucy Honeychurch would be attracted to him and confounded by him on a tour of Italy given for English travelers. He’ll barely say a word at dinner at the pensione, but the next day climbs a cypress tree overlooking a paradise-like Tuscan field to shout “Beauty! L’Espoir!” That’s him “reciting his creed” and invoking “the eternal Yes” his father says.That moment, an eruption of unbridled naivety at the world and at nature, is so pure, even if, or especially if, it’s a little goofy. (Imagine something quite that strange happening in almost any other comfort-food, period costume drama with rom-com overtones since.) But all expressions of genuine wonder are, to an extent. That moment has left its imprint on my heart, and I have even been known, when driving across a particular high-rise bridge to the beach near my home to say, when reaching the top and being overcome with the staggering gorgeousness of the water, sand, and sky revealed below, to say “Beauty! L’Espoir!” also. But I’m not sure I would be so bold as to shout that literally from the treetops to a crowd as Sands’ George does. That is a model of guilelessness and emotional purity worth aspiring to.It’s that openness to the universe and all that it might throw at you that I’d like to think Sands brought to his own way of communing with nature through his hiking — and to the way he met his end. He died doing what he loved.For my part, though, it was hard to believe at the time his disappearance was announced that he really was gone. My IndieWire colleagues and I first heard the news that he was missing while having dinner in Park City, Utah, on the night before the first day of Sundance. With hindsight, we could have run an obit right then. But much like the four days of international news media obsession over the Titan submersible, where everyone imagined that the five travelers to the bottom of the North Atlantic might still be alive and at risk of running out of oxygen, this story had ended at the very beginning. We just didn’t realize it — or want to realize it. Of course, with hindsight, the most obvious explanation was that the submersible simply imploded at the start of its journey, its passengers also losing their lives doing what they loved doing. Of course, with hindsight, Sands was lost immediately.Perhaps our collective denial of the tragedy of these incidents until there’s incontrovertible proof that these were tragedies is a kind of George Emerson guilelessness of its own. In his own way, Sands, with his unforgettable performance, one of cinema’s greatest expressions of optimism, had set the stage for how we’d approach his death.",

        "title": "‘Prisoner’s Daughter’ Review: Brian Cox Continues to Play Problematic Patriarchs in Predictable Feel-Good Drama",
        "content": "It’s almost impossible for Brian Cox to be in a bad movie because, well, he’s giving a Brian Cox performance every time. Simply put, Cox is the saving grace of his latest feature, “Prisoner’s Daughter,” a predictable family drama that has heart thanks to grounding performances by Cox, Ernie Hudson, and breakout child star Christopher Convery. The rest, however, leaves a lot to be desired.However, there are still other pleasures to be found in the final product. Catherine Hardwicke (“Twilight,” “Thirteen”) is building out the perfect frothy cinematic universe where “Prisoner’s Daughter” and her recent Toni Collette vehicle “Mafia Mamma” could beautifully coexist — and make for an enjoyable wild ride.Hardwicke previously spoke with IndieWire’s Kate Erbland about her wide-ranging tastes when it comes to picking scripts, and “Prisoner’s Daughter” is no exception. Written by Mark Bacci and premiering at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival, the family drama centers on criminal Max (Cox) who is released from prison after a 12-year sentence due to a different life sentence: He only has five months to left to live, thanks to a brutal cancer diagnosis.Max moves in with his estranged daughter Maxine (Kate Beckinsale) and her middle school-aged son Ezra (Convery). Enter the adorably touching relationship between Max and Ezra, as the duo bond over boxing and defeating schoolyard bullies who make fun of Ezra’s epilepsy. Cox and Convery’s onscreen chemistry is the crux of the film; scenes flounder when it’s Beckinsale and Cox sharing the screen, while each sequence solely with Beckinsale stands neatly on its own.Basically, it’s hard to go head-to-head with Cox’s acting ability in his post-“Succession” glory. And yet, Convery still commands.In every millennial’s dream casting, Tyson Ritter of All-American Rejects (and, you know, a wide-ranging acting career beginning with “The House Bunny” and including Hardwicke’s “Miss You Already”) plays Ezra’s deadbeat father Tyler, who’s better at drumming and doing drugs than parenting. The central conflict -— which comes too late in the script — is between Tyler and Max battling it out for who should be the rightful male influence for Ezra.Ernie Hudson as Max’s confidante, boxing gym owner, and later, Ezra’s mentor, proves why the older generation onscreen just are better actors. “Castle” and “This Is Us” actor Jon Huertas has a notable cameo, but it’s Hudson and Cox who school their counterparts with their effortless performances. And we mean effortless: Cox wears a fedora and pops on trendy sunglasses while charming his way out of handcuffs in a later mix-up.Cox as former criminal and seedy Las Vegas networker Max is essentially, “what if Logan Roy actually went to jail for the cruise ship SEC scandal?” “Your father,” Max tells grandson Ezra, “is…a loser,” and the line carries as much gravitas as the “Succession” final season breakout quote about his children not being “serious people.”Sure, a grandfather teaching his grandson how to box is pretty cliché. But would Logan Roy be doing the same with Shiv’s future child? Is this the trajectory that Logan Roy would be following in a different “Succession” universe: being a better and gentler grandparent than father?“Prisoner’s Daughter” doesn’t dive as deeply into the father-daughter relationship the title teases, and nor is Maxine the main character of this story. It’s difficult to deduce whether this is because of the plot itself, or just how audiences inherently will immediately pay more attention to the charismatic Cox than Beckinsale’s decent, but not entirely memorable performance.During one particularly emotional exchange where Maxine confronts her dad about abandoning her with an abusive alcoholic and suicidal mother, Beckinsale stumbles with the necessary conviction, whereas Cox casts paragraphs of dialect in just one glance. And while the film’s conclusion feels rushed, the sacrifices made by Max do not go unnoticed. Too bad this film most likely will be.Vertical Entertainment releases “Prisoner’s Daughter” in theaters on Friday, June 30.",

        "title": "Tom Cruise Encourages ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ Double Feature to Support Theaters",
        "content": "Tom Cruise is continuing to save movie theaters.Earlier this year, the “Top Gun: Maverick” star was praised by Steven Spielberg for having “saved Hollywood’s ass” at the box office. Now, Cruise has taken to Twitter to encourage audiences to see this year’s summer blockbusters on the big screen.“This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters,” Cruise tweeted. “Congratulations, Harrison Ford, on 40 years of Indy and one of the most iconic characters in history. I love a double feature, and it doesn’t get more explosive (or more pink) than one with ‘Oppenheimer‘ and ‘Barbie.'”Cruise allegedly also applauded DC tentpole film “The Flash” ahead of its premiere. His own summer action film “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” has already received positive critical reactions ahead of its July 12 debut in theaters.The next month sees the summer movie season ramping up. Harrison Ford’s presumed final appearance as Indy in “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” hits theaters June 30. “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” are set to battle it out at the box office with a shared July 21 release date.“Vanilla Sky” and “Eyes Wide Shut” actor Cruise’s expansive Hollywood career has seen him become a advocate for the sanctity of theaters. Cruise allegedly convinced Paramount to give “Dead Reckoning” a theatrical release without undercutting the box office with a 30-day streaming window premiere on Paramount+.A recent Puck report also claimed that Cruise has personally called rival studio executives and exhibitors in hopes of convincing them to relinquish PLF (premium large-format) screens for “Dead Reckoning” screenings. PLF screens come with an upcharge fee. “Oppenheimer” is already confirmed to be taking over all IMAX screens in North America for three weeks, which could kick out “Dead Reckoning” screenings.An IMAX representative told IndieWire that IMAX will still house a three-week “Oppenheimer” plan for 1,550 out of IMAX’s total 1,700 venues worldwide while the Christopher Nolan film premieres later in China and Japan. “Oppenheimer” was entirely shot in IMAX.This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters.\n\nCongratulations, Harrison Ford, on 40 years of Indy and one of the most iconic characters in history.\n\nI love a double feature, and it doesn't get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Oppenheimer and Barbie. pic.twitter.com/udWHHj4fAe",

        "content": "The first world premiere for the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) has been announced, with Taika Waititi‘s “Next Goal Wins” debuting at this year’s festival.The long-awaited sports comedy is directed and co-written by Waititi. “Next Goal Wins” will make its world premiere at the 48th annual film festival, which runs September 7 through 17.“We’re thrilled to welcome Taika back to the festival and share his audacious take on the most popular sport in the world,” Cameron Bailey, CEO of TIFF, said in a press statement. “‘Next Goal Wins’ is perfect for TIFF fans of the beautiful game looking for their football fix…”“Next Goal Wins” is based on the 2014 documentary of the same name and follows the American Samoa soccer team, infamous for their brutal 31-0 FIFA loss in 2001. With the World Cup Qualifiers approaching, the team hires down-on-his-luck, maverick coach Thomas Rongen (Michael Fassbender), hoping he will turn the world’s worst soccer team around.Will Arnett and Elisabeth Moss also star in the Searchlight Pictures release, along with Oscar Knightley, Kaimana, David Fane, Rachel House, Beulah Koale, Uli Latukefu, Semu Filipo, and Lehi Falepapalangi.To note, Arnett replaced Armie Hammer in the role of a soccer executive. Moss portrays coach Rongen’s wife. Samoan-New Zealand actor Knightley is the head of American Samoa’s soccer federation. Actor Kamaina plays the trans football player Jaiyah Saelua, whose relationship with Coach Rongen is a large part of the film, as writer-director Waititi previously teased.This marks Waititi’s return to TIFF after the 2019 premiere of Oscar-winning “Jojo Rabbit,” for which he won TIFF People’s Choice Award. Waititi has also been bestowed the TIFF Ebert Director Award.Waititi compared “Next Goal Wins” to being the “‘Cool Runnings’ of soccer,” telling Entertainment Weekly earlier this year, “I’d never made a sports film before, and I really wanted to try that out. It’s about a sport I don’t know that much about. Rugby is the national sport in New Zealand, but it’s about underdogs, and I just love underdog stories. Most of my films are about people who live on the margins, or are a little bit left out, and it just fit right in for me.”“Next Goal Wins” is produced by Waititi, Jonathan Cavendish, Garrett Basch, Mike Brett, and Steve Jamison. The film will be released by Searchlight Pictures November 17.",

        "content": "Idris Elba is opening up about the “off-putting” backlash to the decade-long rumor that he will play James Bond.Elba, who has even been fan-cast as 007 by fellow actors like Tom Hanks, admitted during the “SmartLess” podcast that he found it to be a “huge compliment” until discussions over his race tainted it.“The truth is, I was super complimented for a long time about this. I was like, ‘This is crazy!’ James Bond,” Elba said. “We’re all actors and we understand that role. It’s one of those coveted [roles]. Being asked to be James Bond was like, ‘Ok, you’ve sort of reached the pinnacle’. That’s one of those things the whole world has a vote in.”The “Hijack” star continued, “Essentially, it was a huge compliment that every corner of the world except from some corners, which we will not talk about, were really happy about the idea that I could be considered. Those that weren’t happy about the idea made the whole thing disgusting and off-putting, because it became about race. It became about nonsense and I got the brunt of it.”In September 2022, Elba clarified that it is “not a goal for my career” to portray Bond onscreen. “I don’t think that, you know, playing Bond will satisfy some of my personal goals,” the “Wire” alum said at the time. It will definitely satisfy the will of a nation. I’m not gonna lie, every corner of the world I go, and I’m talking about different cultures, they always go ‘Bond,’ and I feel it is beyond me at this junction. It’s beyond me. You know, it’s not a question of, should I, do I, will I. It is what the will of the nation dictates sometimes.”He added of being the first Black Bond, “I’m not that guy, but in everyone’s world I might be. And that — job done, because the truth is, you know, a lot of people are really seeing Idris playing Bond as the ‘alternative Bond.’ And as long as that alternative is existing, that’s great for the growth of fucking casting.”Bond producer Barbara Broccoli confirmed Elba has been “part of the conversation” for casting but later revealed that the replacement for Daniel Craig’s Bond will be a younger actor in his 30s.",

        "title": "Cannes Sales So Far: Wim Wenders’ 3D Doc ‘Anselm’ Lands at Sideshow and Janus Films",
        "content": "The 2023 Cannes Market is behind us, and like clockwork, Neon managed to buy the winner of the Palme d’Or for the fourth straight year, Justine Triet’s “Anatomy of a Fall.”But that wasn’t the only major sale. This year’s Marché du Film netted major domestic deals for some of the buzziest competition titles such as Todd Haynes’ “May December” and Aki Kaurismäki’s “Fallen Leaves,” as well as hot packages like “Paddington 3.” But uncertainty over the writers strike still loomed large, and distributors favored completed projects over packages.Below are some of the deals we’ve tracked out of Cannes so far, and we’ll be updating this space with more sales as they come in.Title: “Anselm”\nSection: Special Screenings\nDistributor: Sideshow and Janus Films Wim Wenders had not one but two separate films play at this year’s Cannes, and now each have found a home. The latest after Neon bought “Perfect Days” is Wenders’ “Anselm,” which sees the German auteur once again playing with 3-D. Sideshow and Janus Films acquired the U.S. rights (now their third pickup) to the title and are planning a theatrical release later this year after the fall festivals.  “Anselm” follows artist Anselm Kiefer and explores his fascination with myth and history. Wenders weaves the past and present and the line between film and painting to immerse audiences in Kiefer’s art, all in 3-D and a stunning 6K resolution.  It is produced by Karsten Brünig for Road Movies and executive produced by Jeremy Thomas.  The deal was negotiated by HanWay on behalf of the filmmakers with Sideshow and Janus Films. Title: “Omen”\nSection: Un Certain Regard\nDistributor: Utopia Indie distributor Utopia won the rights to this year’s Un Certain Regard winner, acquiring North American distribution rights for “Omen” from artist and musician turned film director Baloji, according to Variety.  “Omen” follows a young man from the Congo who after spending years in Belgium returns home to be confronted by his past and culture at a family gathering. The film grapples with themes of ancestry, belief, wrestling, witchcraft, and sorcery across Africa and is described as a psychedelic fairy tale.  Marc Zinga stars in the film alongside Lucie Debay, Elaine Umuhire, Yves-Marina Gnahoua, and Marcel Otete Kabeya. Baloji co-wrote the script with Thomas van Zulen. “Omen” was produced by Benoit Roland for Wrong Men and was co-produced by Sander Verdonck for New Amsterdam and Emmanuel Lupia for Tosala Films. This deal was negotiated by DiGiacomo on behalf of Utopia and Mathieu Delaunay of Memento International on behalf of the filmmakers. Title: “The Feeling That The Time For Doing Something Has Passed”\nSection: Directors Fortnight\nDistributor: MagnoliaMagnolia Pictures acquired the North American rights to Joanna Arnow’s comedy “The Feeling That The Time For Doing Something Has Passed,” which played in Directors’ Fortnight and is executive produced by “Tangerine” filmmaker Sean Baker.Arnow also wrote, edited, and stars in the film as a 30-something New York woman as time passes in her long-term casual BDSM relationship, low-level corporate job, and quarrelsome Jewish family. The deadpan and self-deprecating film is Arnow’s directorial debut following her shorts “Bad Dancing” that won a prize at Berlin and the feature documentary “I hate myself.”The film is produced by Pierce Varous and Graham Swon. The film is executive produced by Sean Baker,  Adam Mirels, and Robbie Mirels and also stars Scott Cohen (“Gilmore Girls”), Babak Tafti (“Billions,” “Succession”), and Alysia Reiner (“Fig,” “Orange is the New Black”), Michael Cyril Creighton (“Only Murders in the Building”).The deal was negotiated by Magnolia SVP of Acquisitions John Von Thaden, and by Graham Swon, producer of the film.Title: “The Pot-Au-Feu”\nSection: Competition\nDistributor: Sapan Studios and IFC FilmsWhile questions have circulated about the new look IFC Films, the indie distributor has now acquired a movie from the competition slate of movies at Cannes, partnering with Sapan Studios (the first in a new output deal) to acquire the North American rights to “The Pot-Au-Feu.” The film is a French romance starring two of France’s bigger stars, Juliette Binoche and Benoît Magimel.Director Trần Anh Hùng (“The Scent of Green Papaya”) won the Best Director prize in the official competition at Cannes this year, and IndieWire in its review said it’s a delightful movie because of its great attention to detail with food, with the director calling on Culinary Director Pierre Gagnaire to not use any fake dishes on set. “This is a story about love and food, which it presents as the same thing.”Set in France in the late 19th century, the film follows a chef living with his personal cook and lover, restraining their emotions but not their gastronomy, leading the chef to do something he has never done before: cook for her.The film was produced by Olivier Delbosc and is adapted from a novel by Marcel Rouff called “La Vie et la Passion de Dodin-Bouffant, gourmet.” However, the film veers from the book, which is set after Bionche’s character has died.The deal for the film was negotiated by IFC and Sapan Studios with Scott Shooman, Adam Koehler and Josh Sapan leading discussions with Alexis Cassanet and Sarah Keo Kosal of Gaumont.  Title: “Jeanne du Barry”\nSection: Out of Competition\nDistributor: VerticalDespite controversy following both director Maïwenn’s and star Johnny Depp, “Jeanne du Barry,” the opening night movie at this year’s Cannes, landed a North American distribution deal from Vertical. No specific release plans were unveiled.The film stars Depp as the French King Louis XV in a supporting role and primarily follows Maïwenn as Jeanne Vaubernier, an 18th Century French working class woman who became King Louis XV’s lover. Maïwenn co-wrote, directed, stars, and produced “Jeanne du Barry.” The co-writers are Teddy Lussi-Modeste and Nicolas Livecchi and the film’s producers are Pascal Caucheteux and Grégoire Sorlat.“Jeanne du Barry” has already opened in French cinemas and has made $4.1 million in its first two weeks of release.CAA and Goodfellas handled the North American sale.Title: “Last Summer”\nSection: Competition\nDistributor: Sideshow and Janus Films There goes another competition title off the market. Sideshow and Janus Films, in their second acquisition this week, acquired “Last Summer,” which is the first film from French director Catherine Breillat (“Bluebeard”) in a decade. The distributors are planning a theatrical release after playing the fall festivals.  “Last Summer” is produced by Saïd Ben Saïd and is an adaptation of the 2019 Danish film “Queen of Hearts.” The film follows a lawyer living a harmonious suburban life in Paris with her family until her husband’s son from a previous marriage comes to live with them, threatening her career, her relationship, and putting her family’s life in danger.  The film stars Léa Drucker, Samuel Kircher, and Olivier Rabourdin and was written by Breillat with the collaboration of Pascal Bonitzer. “Last Summer” is an SBS production.  The deal was negotiated by Pyramide International on behalf of the filmmakers with Sideshow and Janus Films. Title: “Monster”\nSection: Competition\nDistributor: Well Go USAJapanese master Hirokazu Kore-eda’s latest film “Monster” has landed a North American theatrical distribution deal from Well Go USA. It will hit theaters either in late 2023 or early 2024.Kore-eda’s melodramatic film is a riff of sorts on “Rashomon” that emotionally has the complexity of a Christopher Nolan movie, as IndieWire’s review describes it, looking from multiple different perspectives about why a boy at school begins displaying strange and unusual behavior.The film returns Kore-eda to his native Japan for the first time since he won the Palme for “Shoplifters” in 2018, and “Monster” came away with the Screenplay prize from Ruben Östlund’s jury for writer Yuji Sakamoto.The deal was negotiated by Goodfellas and CAA Media Finance.Title: “About Dry Grasses”\nSection: Competition\nDistributor: Sideshow and Janus Films“About Dry Grasses,” the latest film from Turkish auteur Nuri Bilge Ceylan, was acquired for U.S. distribution by Sideshow and Janus Films. The film won the Best Actress prize for star Merve Dizdar from the jury led by Ruben Östlund. Sideshow and Janus plan to release the movie in theaters following further debuts at fall festivals.In “About Dry Grasses,” Samet, a young art teacher, is finishing his fourth year of compulsory service in a remote village in Anatolia. After a turn of events he can hardly make sense of, he loses his hopes of escaping the grim life he seems to be stuck in. Will his encounter with Nuray, herself a teacher, help him overcome his angst?The movie is an NBC Film, Memento Production and Komplizen Film Production. The screenplay was written by Akin Aksu, Ebru Ceylan and Nuri Bilge Ceylan and stars Deniz Celiloglu, Merve Dizdar, Musab Ekici and Eve Bagci. Sideshow and Janus’ “About Dry Grasses” acquisition is their first acquisition out of the festival after they last year bought Jerzy Skolimowski’s “EO” and the year before that acquired the Best Picture nominee Ryusuke Hamaguchi’s “Drive My Car.”The deal was negotiated by Playtime on behalf of the filmmakers with Sideshow and Janus Films.Title: “Hot Mess”\nSection: Package\nDistributor: VerticalIn a package sale out of the Cannes market, Vertical secured North American rights to an Emma Roberts comedy called “Hot Mess” with an eye to begin shooting the project in early 2024. The film is currently in pre-production.“Hot Mess” is the directorial debut of Katie Locke O’Brien and is written by Gabrielle D’Amico. It follows Roberts as a woman who implodes and fails to find love on a wildly popular dating show and finds herself moving back home to her parents’ basement, all while bumping into her ex-boyfriend around town.Debbie Liebling, Maggie Malina, and Laura Lewis are producing the project. Mister Smith Entertainment is handling international sales.Title: “Perfect Days”\nSection: Competition\nDistributor: NeonAfter already buying Palme winner “Anatomy of a Fall” and the out-of-competition “Robot Dreams” earlier in the fest, the distributor has closed a deal to acquire North American rights to Wim Wenders’ latest film “Perfect Days” in the mid-to-high seven figure range, an individual with knowledge told IndieWire.Seller The Match Factory also sold out other international rights for the film, including MUBI taking rights to the UK, Ireland, Latin America, and Turkey.“Perfect Days” is a Japanese film from the German auteur and follows a man content with his simple life of cleaning toilets, only for a series of chance encounters to break him out of his tranquil routine and slowly reveal more about the man’s past.The film stars Koji Yakusho, Arisa Nakano, Tokio Emoto, Yumi Aso, Sayuri Ishikawa, Tomokazu Miura, Aoi Yamada, and Min Tanaka. Wenders directed and co-wrote the script with Takuma Takasaki. Wenders and Takasaki are also producers along with Koji Yanai.Title: “Fallen Leaves”\nSection: Competition\nDistributor: MUBIMUBI will not stop. The distributor has now picked up “Fallen Leaves,” the 20th film from Finnish auteur Aki Kaurismäki that is playing in the main competition and is already earning early raves as a potential contender for the Palme d’Or.MUBI acquired the North American rights, as well as UK, Ireland, Latin America, and Turkey, in a bidding war out of Cannes following its premiere Monday. Kaurismäki’s tragicomedy will be released theatrically and release plans will be announced soon.The film tells the story of two lonely people who meet each other by chance in the Helsinki night and try to find the first, only, and ultimate love of their lives. Their path towards this honorable goal is clouded by the man’s alcoholism, lost phone numbers, not knowing each other’s names or addresses, and life’s general tendency to place obstacles in the way of those seeking their happiness.The film was produced by Sputnik Oy and Bufo and co-produced by Pandora Film. Written and directed by Aki Kaurismäki, “Fallen Leaves” stars Alma Pöysti, Jussi Vatanen, Janne Hyytiäinen, and Nuppu Koivu. The film was made with the support of the Finnish Film Foundation, Yle, the Finnish Broadcasting Company, ZDF/ARTE, ARTE G.E.I.E, Filmförderungsanstalt, and Film-und Medienstiftung NRW.The Match Factory is handling international sales. Check out IndieWire’s review here.Title: “The Settlers”\nSection: Un Certain Regard\nDistributor: MUBIFor MUBI’s third acquisition out of Cannes, the distributor and art house streamer acquired North American rights (and other territories) to Un Certain Regard title “The Settlers.” The film will be released theatrically, and release plans will be announced soon.Felipe Gálvez directs the Chilean period drama set at the beginning of the 20th century and is about a wealthy landowner who hires three horsemen to mark out the perimeter of his extensive property and open a route to the Atlantic Ocean across vast Patagonia. The expedition, composed of a young Chilean mestizo, an American mercenary, and led by a reckless British lieutenant, soon turns into a “civilizing” raid.

        "title": "Catherine Hardwicke Says ‘Twilight’ TV Show Should Keep Vampire Romance ‘More Grounded’",
        "content": "“Twilight” director Catherine Hardwicke hopes the upcoming TV series adaptation sinks its teeth deeper into the forbidden romance at the center of the teen vampire saga.Hardwicke helmed the first film that was released in 2008 and starred Kristen Stewart as high schooler Bella and Robert Pattinson as undead bloodsucker Edward. The director stepped away from the franchise after the initial film’s mixed reception and was replaced by Chris Weitz. Lionsgate recently announced a TV series adaptation in early development over a decade since the film series concluded in 2012.“I think it’s exciting,” Hardwicke told MovieWeb of the upcoming show. “I think we see that it’s an enduring story that people keep engaging with. You know, the TikTok world loves it, the internet generations, everybody keeps finding it. I was talking to a girl the other day, she was born the year we made the first ‘Twilight’ film, and she was very passionate about it.”Hardwicke continued, “So I think, if anything, in the first one, we were able to keep it a little bit more grounded, just a little bit. You felt like there was some kind of reality to it, and you really felt the connection between Bella and Edward. So that might be a fun way to think about it, but also the chemistry between Edward and Bella is so important.”“Twilight” author Stephanie Meyer is expected to be involved in the TV series, and film franchise producers Wyck Godfrey and Erik Feig will executive produce. Sinead Daly is attached to write the show.Hardwicke told IndieWire earlier this year that she was skeptical whether author Meyer will sign off on more iterations of the novels.“I don’t know if Stephenie [Meyer] will go for it, that’s the only thing,” Hardwicke said, noting that more “Twilight” content “would be fun.”“There’ve been a million things like, ‘Can we do a TV series?’ There’s been a million funny parodies,” the “Mafia Mamma” director said. “Seeing a whole new crowd of people playing those parts, that could be quite interesting. Why not? Do a twist on it! Let’s do ‘Twilight’ in outer space, that would be fun. Or set it in the past. Let’s do it back in the Wild West! We could do that Oregon Trail or something like that. The Oregon Trail wasn’t hard enough! You’re dying of dysentery, or you could be bit by a vampire.”Hardwicke also reflected on the creative decision to show Edward (Pattinson) biting Bella (Stewart) onscreen, which was never featured in the first book.“I’m like, ‘No, we’re going to see it.’ We’re going to get visual. We’re going to make physical the things that are mental in the books, like the treetop scene,” she said. “Every chance for an action sequence where you can express character through action, I love that. Let’s make it physical if we can.”The “Prisoner’s Daughter” director concluded, “We have all those dumb things that people think: ‘A woman can’t direct action. A woman doesn’t understand visual effects.’ All these annoying things, no matter how many times you say, ‘OK, well, look at Kathryn Bigelow or look at this or look at this.’ My first jobs were in visual effects when I came to L.A., so I do understand them very well. It’s kind of annoying. You get told, ‘This isn’t really the kind of movie for you.’ Even after I had ‘Twilight,’ I was told that same kind of thing.”",

        "title": "25 Movies and TV Shows Stephen King Doesn’t Like, from ‘Succession’ to ‘Kill Bill’",
        "content": "Stephen King is among history’s most frequently adapted writers, up there with Charles Dickens, the Brothers Grimm, and William Shakespeare for inspiring the most successful page-to-picture creations. From Rob Reiner and David Cronenberg to Mike Flanagan and Andy Muschietti, genre filmmakers have clamored to take on King’s words for decades.There’s no shortage of material to go around, of course. Horror’s reigning titan of literary terror has written more than 60 books and 200 short stories: many of them rooted in King’s signature strangeness and the believable humanity that turned 2017’s “It” into a global sensation. King has teamed up with his son Joe Hill to produce even more cinematic fodder in recent years. The pair’s “In the Tall Grass” novella became a Netflix movie in 2019, and Hill enjoyed his own success with Scott Derrickson’s 2022 “The Black Phone” adaptation.Almost all of King’s titles boast the imaginative nightmares for which the author is renowned: a perverse pull for audiences that for good or bad is now tried and true. King has found reasonable success in adapting his own work; see the screenplays for George A. Romero’s “Creepshow” (1982) and Mary Lambert’s “Pet Sematary” (1989). But these days, he mainly contributes to Hollywood through carefully crafted books and snide little tweets.Outspoken as ever, King regularly takes to social media to share his thoughts on politics and the state of pop culture. The Maine-born writer slips in his film opinions from time to time, typically reacting to onscreen interpretations of his work but occasionally taking aim at whatever he’s seen latest. King has brutally picked apart the merits of Quentin Tarantino’s “Kill Bill” and Michael Bay’s “Transformers,” even calling Tim Burton’s “Mars Attacks!” a “benchmark of awfulness.” They’re harsh words, sure. But does the “if you can’t say something nice” adage really apply to the guy who dreamed up “Misery”?Listed in no particular order, here are 24 films and one TV show that Stephen King has disliked or given a bad review. These include the author’s criticisms of King adaptations, from Stanley Kubrick’s “The Shining” to Mark L. Lester’s “Firestarter” and Brett Leonard’s “The Lawnmower Man.”For four seasons, “Succession” gripped TV lovers (or, at least, TV lovers on Twitter), becoming the most talked about and universally acclaimed series in recent HBO memory. But King doesn’t count himself as a fan of Jesse Armstrong’s generational tragicomedy, and appeared to take a swipe at the press’ breathless coverage of the series after it ended.  “NYTimes headline: ”Succession’ is over. Why did we care?'” King tweeted in May 2023, two days after the series finale aired. “Here’s a newsflash for you: A lot of us didn’t.”One of the goofiest monster movies imaginable, 1972’s “Night of the Lepus” stars Stuart Whitman and Janet Leigh as a married couple forced to contend with a dangerous unexpected threat: giant mutated rabbits. Unsurprisingly, the adaptation of Russell Braddon’s 1964 novel “The Year of the Angry Rabbit” was critically panned upon release for its poor execution and laughably unscary antagonists. On Twitter in May 2023, King shared his hopes for Turner Classic Movies to do a “giant animal” programming block, suggeting films like “Them,” “Tarantula,” “Willard,” and “Empire of the Ants.” In a follow-up tweet, he explicitly requested “Night of the Lepus” be left off the lineup. “Giant bunny rabbits? Get out of here,” he tweeted. Sure, it’s a stretch to say that King has outright declared his hate for “Raging Bull.” But the author doesn’t seem to be fond of Martin Scorsese’s well-loved biopic of boxer Jake LaMotta either. In April 2023, after fellow writer Megan Abbott declared on Twitter that the 1980 flick is “still the best movie of all time,” King quote tweeted her with a blunt “Sorry, no.” Hopefully he’ll explain his reservations some other time, preferably in a knock out fight with Scorsese. Many of the films King has publicly denounced are adaptations of his work, but the author is actually a fan of the original 1984 “Children of the Corn.” Based on his short story about a cult of murderous children in a remote Nebraskan town, the original film was helmed by Fritz Kiersch, and King “thought they did a pretty good job on that,” as he put it in a 2016 Deadline interview. The original film spawned a whole franchise, with 10 additional movies being made; the latest was released this March. King has no defense for the original’s followup. “I could do without all of the ‘Children of the Corn’ sequels,” he said. “Graveyard Shift” is one of King’s more imaginative short stories, focusing on a textile mill infested by a rat empire cut off from the rest of nature, causing them to develop and evolve into frightening, gigantic creatures. That imagination didn’t really translate to the 1990 film adaptation from Ralph S. Singleton, which holds an impressive 0 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes (off of only seven reviews, but still). In his interview with Deadline, King named the feature one of his least favorite adaptations of his work, calling it a “kind of a quick exploitation picture.” One of King’s best known novels is “Salem’s Lot,” his 1975 sophomore book about a Maine town getting invaded by powerful vampire Kurt Barlow. The book was adapted in 1979 into a positively reviewed TV miniseries, which earned three Emmy nominations. Eight years latter, a theatrical film sequel to the limited series was produced, focusing on a completely new protagonist and featuring no original cast members. The movie, which baffingly premiered at Cannes Film Festival, was panned, and in a 2007 interview with Time Magazine, King lumped it in with the “Children of the Corn” films as a stinker. In a 2007 interview with Stephen King fansite “Liija’s Library,” King labeled 1993’s “Needful Things” as a “disappointment” among the various adaptations of his work that have been produced. Directed by Fraser C. Heston, the film adapts King’s novel about Leland Gaunt: a mysterious antique store proprieter who sows discord in a small town by forcing his customers to engage in pranks in exchange for his items.   Despite a solid cast — including Max Von Sydow as Gaunt, with Ed Harris, Bonnie Bedelia, and Amanda Plummer in supporting roles — the film was panned by critics. A three-hour extended cut later aired on TBS in 1996  to moderately better reception.  Give King credit for this; he’s just as willing to trash his own work as he is other people’s. Case in point is “Maximum Overdrive,” King’s first and only feature directorial effort. Based on the author’s short story “Trucks,” the rickety horror comedy follows a machine uprising, as trucks, arcade games, ATMs, and so on become sentinent and attempt to wipe out humanity. The campy film opened to negative reviews and gained King a Golden Rasberry nom for Worst Director, and in the years since King has made it clear he’s not proud of it. He’s admitted he didn’t know what he was doing and was “coked out of his mind” during production, and has referred to the final product as a “moron movie.” “Blood Feast” is considered by some the first ever “splatter” film, with its high level of onscreen gore paving the way for “Cannibal Holocaust” and the comtemporary “Terrifier.” In spite of that historical significance, Herschell Gordon Lewis’ flick about a Miami waiter who murders women and steals their body parts to resurrect the goddess Ishtar was widely panned by critics at the time, and its hokey acting and obvious special effects haven’t helped it hold up in the modern day. King doesn’t go against the grain with this one, and tweeted that it was the worst horror movie he’d ever seen in 2021.Kicking off a (particularly pointed) Twitter thread, King asked his followers which movies they had walked out of mid-showing. His answer? “I have walked out of only one movie as an adult: ‘Transformers.’”Michael Bay’s 2007 take on the popular Hasbro toy line was an unquestionable success at the box office, appealing to a wide range of ages thanks to its PG-13 rating. It was heavily praised for its then groundbreaking visual effects, but remains unpopular among critics who argue its characters and storyline were underdeveloped — and remained thin for much of the franchise. Bay hasn’t spoken out against his first “Transformers” outing. However, the filmmaker admitted he “made too many of them” in a March 2022 interview with Unilad.Yes, you read that right: Stephen King took serious issue with “Kill Bill.” He disliked it so much the horror author reviewed it for Entertainment Weekly in February 2007, calling it “tepid” and “a film that doesn’t matter.”“You probably saw some good reviews of it, possibly even in this magazine,” King wrote. “Steve says don’t you believe it. Steve says you should remember that movie critics see movies free. Also, they don’t have to pay the babysitter or spring ten bucks for the parking. They’re thus apt to rhapsodize over narcissistic stuff like ‘Kill Bill,’ which announces itself as Quentin Tarantino’s Fourth Film, ain’t we la-di-da.”King goes on to criticize Tarantino’s use of over-the-top violence, rockstar director “vanities,” and Uma Thurman: “stuck playing a woman who’s a label instead of a human being.”Speaking with Entertainment Tonight, Tarantino responded to King’s review and said, “Stephen King took a dig at me for starting off ‘Kill Bill’ with ‘Quentin Tarantino’s fourth film,’ you know, ‘la-di-da!’ I can imagine someone taking a cynical view like that. But to me, I meant it, and not in some airy-fairy way. This is my fourth movie and I haven’t done anything in a long time. It’s telling you who I am today, and the fifth will tell you something else.”To make his point about “Kill Bill Vol. 1,” King compared Tarantino’s kung fu epic to a number of other films. He most notably drew contrast with Clint Eastwood’s “Mystic River,” a film he regards as technically masterful and hugely important to the history of cinema. On the other end of the spectrum, King described two movies as the “benchmark of awfulness.” First up? Tim Burton’s “Mars Attacks!”Infused with the questionable sensibilities of Ed Wood and more B movie auteurs, this 1996 sci-fi horror comedy is on par with “Killer Klowns from Outerspace.” Its at once notoriously despised and contemporarily beloved for its intense camp. (Audiences still returning to the film tend to be more positive.)“It was a bomb in America,” Burton said in 2021 anniversary retrospective for Inverse. “It was the first movie I did where it was more successful internationally. It seemed to be much more well-received and more ‘got,’ in a way, by other countries.”Another of King’s benchmarks for awfulness is “Mommie Dearest”: an indisputably terrible 1981 drama that’s since gained a cult following for its unintended comedic charms, akin to Tommy Wiseau’s “The Room” (albeit with fewer technical issues).It’s directed by the late Academy Award nominee Frank Perry, and chronicles the sordid personal life of Hollywood icon Joan Crawford and her daughter Christina, who first alleged her mother’s abuse in a memoir of the same name. Winner of Worst Picture at that year’s Razzies — the second ever — “Mommie Dearest” is best known for Faye Dunaway’s extreme portrayal of Joan. The “Network” actress reportedly blamed the flop for her subsequent decline in castings.“Mars Attacks!” and “Mommie Dearest” may be King’s touchstones for mediocre movie-making, but it was “The Godfather: Part III” that drew most of his ire in the aforementioned “Kill Bill” analysis. He first praised Francis Ford Coppola’s “Dementia 13”: a low-budget project filmed in just nine days that properly launched the director’s career.“Many years later, Coppola spent at least a thousand times what he spent on ‘Dementia 13’ to make the last of the ‘Godfather’ movies,” King wrote of the contrast between the projects. “The film is opulent, incoherent, and boring. ‘The Godfather Part III’ is a movie that doesn’t matter. The difference? One has heart, soul, and the crazy enthusiasm of youth. The other is the work of a talented man who has either used all his talent up or is saving what’s left for another day.”Kate Erbland called the first adaptation attempt for King’s eight-book magnum opus a “disaster of a film,” giving 2017’s “The Dark Tower” a dismal D+ in her review for IndieWire. The Nikolaj Arcel-directed film, starring Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey, had heaps of problems. But for King (via Entertainment Weekly), it boils down to its PG-13 rating — a decision he said “lost a lot of the toughness” in his gunslinging sci-fi source material — and the overstuffed nature of fitting 4,000 pages into a tidy running time.“I thought to myself, ‘Well, people are going to be really puzzled by this,’ and they were,” King said of the script, which begins roughly halfway through the books. “So there was some of that problem, too.” Horror heavyweight Mike Flanagan will attempt an adaptation next in a TV series in development at Netflix.“The Shining” is easily King’s most famous adaptation disappointment, in no small part because Stanley Kubrick’s take on the Overlook Hotel is widely regarded as a masterpiece — and by default, remains the best known telling of King’s story. The author has complained about everything from Jack Nicholson’s performance to the misogynistic tweaks made to the character of Wendy Torrance (played by Shelley Duvall under infamously bad working conditions). “I think ‘The Shining’ is a beautiful film and it looks terrific and as I’ve said before, it’s like a big, beautiful Cadillac with no engine inside it,” King once told Deadline. “In that sense, when it opened, a lot of the reviews weren’t very favorable and I was one of those reviewers. I kept my mouth shut at the time, but I didn’t care for it much.” Asked broadly about filmmakers’ varying takes on his work by American Film Magazine in 1986 (via Slash Film), King called out the Drew Barrymore-starring commercial success “Firestarter.” “‘Firestarter’ is one of the worst of the bunch, even though in terms of story it’s very close to the original,” King said. “But it’s flavorless; it’s like cafeteria mashed potatoes. There are things that happen in terms of special effects in that movie that make no sense to me whatsoever. Why this kid’s hair blows every time she starts fires is totally beyond my understanding. I never got a satisfactory answer when I saw the rough cut. By that time, [producer Dino De Laurentis] was regularly asking me for input. Sometimes he’d take it.”King continued to complain about lead David Keith (“My wife said that he has stupid eyes…”) and noted that Martin Sheen had repeated his performance from “The Dead Zone,” perhaps unwittingly. “That’s all there is; it’s the same character exactly,” he said.Speaking with The Guardian in 2013 (aka the afterglow of the Twilight craze), King took swings at three of his literary contemporaries. He first critiqued Stephenie Meyer’s ability to craft a fantasy world rooted in human emotion. “I read ‘Twilight’ and didn’t feel any urge to go on with her,” King said of the seminal Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson work. He continued, arguing the love story should’ve been deeper before describing the film as “tweenager porn.” (Intriguing words from the man behind the infamous “It” orgy, to be sure.) In the same 2013 interview, King shared his distate for Suzanne Collins’ dystopian YA series. The author likened Collins’ work to his own, noting the similarities between “The Hunger Games” and 1982’s “The Running Man.” “I read ‘The Hunger Games’ and didn’t feel an urge to go on,” King said. “It’s not unlike ‘The Running Man,’ which is about a game where people are actually killed and people are watching: a satire on reality TV.”Notably, King had previously complimented Collins’ work in a 2008 piece written for Entertainment Weekly. Some of his comments were cheekily disparaging (“Gale is smoldering. Says so right on page 14.”) But overall, the author praised Collins’ writing and said he was eager for new installments. Evidently, that enthusiasm did not last.Rounding out King’s comments on popular 2013 authors, the novelist told The Guardian he was not a fan of E. L. James’ “Fifty Shades of Grey.” The film adaptation, starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, was still in production at the time. But considering the faithful nature of the major movie franchise, it’s probably safe to say King hasn’t ever — and won’t ever — see it. “I read ‘Fifty Shades Of Grey’ and felt no urge to go on,” King repeated, before expanding on his confusion about the book’s reputation in popular culture. “They call it ‘mommy porn,’ but it’s not really ‘mommy porn.’ It is highly charged, sexually driven fiction for women who are, say, between 18 and 25.” A critic true to his high standards, King has freely shared which of his own books he’s soured on over the years. Although it’s a miniseries (clocking in at just over three hours), 1993’s “The Tommyknockers” joins King’s list of vexing adaptations: written at the height of his battle with addiction.“‘The Tommyknockers’ is an awful book,” King told Rolling Stone in 2014. “That was the last one I wrote before I cleaned up my act. And I’ve thought about it a lot lately and said to myself, ‘There’s really a good book in here, underneath all the sort of spurious energy that cocaine provides, and I ought to go back.’ The book is about 700 pages long, and I’m thinking, ‘There’s probably a good 350-page novel in there.'” ABC’s TV adaptation was panned upon release.Another of King’s self-disappointments is “Dreamcatcher”: the novel he wrote following a devastating accident that nearly lost the author his leg in 1999. (King was struck from behind by an out-of-control vehicle, which he later purchased and had destroyed reportedly out of concern that fans would want it.) “I don’t like ‘Dreamcatcher’ very much,” King told Rolling Stone in the same 2014 interview discussing “The Tommyknockers.” “‘Dreamcatcher’ was written after the accident. I was using a lot of Oxycontin for pain. And I couldn’t work on a computer back then because it hurt too much to sit in that position. So I wrote the whole thing longhand. And I was pretty stoned when I wrote it, because of the Oxy, and that’s another book that shows the drugs at work.” The work was soon adapted by director Lawrence Kasdan in a 2003 film starring Damian Lewis, Thomas Jane, Morgan Freeman, Jason Lee, Timothy Olyphant, and more. It was ridiculed upon release and barely made back its budget at the box office. Does Brett Leonard’s “The Lawnmower Man” even count as a King adaptation? The author didn’t think so, and neither did the judge who awarded him $2.5 million in damages as part of a 1993 settlement related to the film’s marketing. King argued the Pierce Brosnan-starring sci-fi horror was so derivative from his short story that the author should be allowed to pull his name from the title. Aside from an unauthorized home release of “Stephen King’s Lawnmower Man” by New Line — a spectacularly bad move that landed the studio in even more hot water — the 1992 sci-fi flick now bears only one (understated) credit for King.Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, “The Running Man” is another so-called adaptation that wildly deviates from King’s words. Yes, it still involves the central concept of disenfranchised people entering a “Most Dangerous Game”-style survival competition to better their lives in a dystopian future. But pretty much everything else about this action flick, from the plot points to the overly slick visual effects, is wrong for King’s intent. In “On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft” (h/t SlashFilm), King specifically called out Schwarzenegger’s casting as a bizarre misstep. “Baby Driver” director Edgar Wright will attempt to adapt the material next.In a ranking of his favorite films from 2009 for Entertainment Weekly, King praised director Dennis Iliadis’s remake of “The Last House on the Left.” He soundly rejected the Wes Craven original in his commentary, describing the filmmaker’s controversial directorial debut as a “crapfest.” The 1972 rape revenge exploitation flick is notorious for its intense violence and cruel bursts of humor, as well as the alleged abuse faced by starring actress Sandra Peabody on set.",

        "title": "The ‘Indiana Jones’ Films, Ranked",
        "content": "It’s only fitting that the “Indiana Jones” franchise — a film series (plus a TV show, books, comic books, video games, and more) literally built on a hearty love of history — be the subject of so much mythologizing. George Lucas sold Steven Spielberg on it by deeming it “better than James Bond”! The second film is so much darker than the filmmakers’ previous efforts because they were both going through tough breakups! At one point, Indy had a big dog! But beyond the franchise’s storied origins, there’s at least one facet of the series that we can go ahead and clear up right now: which film is the best. Oh, no? That’s also up for debate? Sounds about right, and is surely worthy of more exploration and deep-digging.Five films and more than four decades since its inception, Spielberg and Lucas’ dashing action-adventures franchise about an archeologist (an actual nerd and an alluring hero) and his globe-trotting exploits — heavy on the otherworldly, with plenty of indelible human characters to also keep it down to earth — is coming to an ostensible close with one last entry.Since “Raiders of the Lost Ark” hit theaters in 1981, the Harrison Ford-starring series has made a staggering amount of box office bucks (nearly 2 billion worldwide) and proven to be one of American cinema’s most reliably entertaining franchises. Built on everything from a serious affection for the rootin’-tootin’ movie serials of its creators’ youth to a deep affection for killing Nazis (something we truly hope never goes out of style) and grand adventures that can hinge on everything from intelligent animals to slippery diamonds, Indy’s jaunts are also just plain fun. What else is the multiplex for, other than standing up and cheering over beat-back bad guys, high-flying adventures, epic love stories, and “X” (sometimes) marking the spot? With the fifth (and allegedly final) film in the series, “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” arriving in theaters this week, we take on our own mission steeped in legend, lore, fortune, glory, and a love for one of cinema’s greatest adventurers: ranking the Indiana Jones films.The first film in the franchise — simply “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” not “Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark,” please — isn’t just the perfect prototype for an Indy adventure, it’s also a winning example of how to kick off any new film franchise. Director Steven Spielberg and creator and co-writer George Lucas had signed a five-picture deal with Paramount Pictures before making this feature, and it’s thrilling to see what information they give us about our fedora-ed hero, knowing this is their best attempt to get the audience on board with his whole deal.We meet Indy (much later, of course, we’ll learn his real name) in the middle of a daring adventure to capture a priceless relic. And while that’s thrilling enough, what we learn next — that he’s actually an archaeologist, not a treasure-hunter, and that he’s about to set out on yet another adventure that involves perma-obsessions (like star-crossed love Marion Ravenwood and beating Nazis at every turn) — helps chart a course for Indy and his franchise that has endured for decades.The adventure that follows provides the framework for a series that still delights with its globe-trotting missions, soaring John Williams tracks, hat-tipping grins from Indy, damn fine ingenuity, and a very healthy dose of both history and mysticism — all tied up into a package that is both satisfying and open-ended. It’s the first film in the series and the best: a mission statement and a promise, and the blueprint for everything to come. If “Raiders of the Lost Ark” laid the blueprint for what an Indy picture should look like, how it should move, and what it should tell us, “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade” upended that, sorta. The film’s opening sequence, in which the late River Phoenix plays young Indy, is chock-a-block with winks and nods to some of adult Indy’s most memorable personality traits.It’s the kind of fan service-y stuff that would later come to dominate this sort of cinematic franchise, but within the context of the third film, it’s delightfully silly and fun. How did Indy get his hat? Where did his chin scar come from? Why is he afraid of snakes? Who would possibly care about any of that? Spielberg doles all this info out with such giddiness that it’s impossible to enter the third film in the franchise without similar audience jubilation.And then they go and add Sean Connery to the mix. Sean Connery! As Indy’s dad! A wonderful bit of casting that adds new dimension both to Indy’s usual adventures, giving us Henry Jones Sr. helps recontextualize many of Indy’s bigger hang-ups, too. As the younger Jones goes on the run in hopes of saving his dear old dad (from Nazis, it’s always Nazis) and keeping nothing less than the Holy Grail from falling into the wrong hands (again, the Nazis), the third film in the franchise absolutely crackles with life. It all makes not just for an excellent Indiana Jones picture, but a sterling example of how franchises can continue to ideate and evolve, even when they opt for seemingly obvious additions (Sean Connery? As Indy’s dad?) to keep the storytelling going. Let it never be said that Lucas and Spielberg weren’t innovative when it came to their serialized storytelling. For the second film in the franchise, the duo actually opted for a prequel, zinging Indy back in time a year (“Raiders” opens in 1936, while “Temple of Doom” is set in 1935) to give us a fuller look at how our hero came to be. In this iteration, Indy is a bit more cocky, far more compelled by “fortune and glory” than in preserving historical items for their educational value (audiences would have to wait five years to hear the hero growl, “It belongs in a museum!” in the third film, an ethos that doesn’t make for the kickiest catchphrase).This Indiana Jones is indeed a bit rougher around the edges, and so too is Spielberg’s Asia-set adventure, which propels Indy (and adorable sidekick Short Round, played by eventual Oscar winner Ke Huy Quan) through glittering Shanghai and straight into the Indian countryside. All the hallmarks of an Indy adventure are still here, especially Indy’s eventual desire to save a kidnapped and enslaved group of young children from (as always!) an evil group of deranged baddies, even if some of the set-dressing (monkey brains?) feels a touch cheap.Tucked in alongside some truly dark imagery, however, are some incredible gags, many of them thanks to Kate Capshaw’s dizzy dame Willie Scott, whose performance only gets better with each subsequent re-watch. The bit in the jungle, with all the different animals “attacking” her, as Indy and Short Round basically sigh at her exploits? Genius.We may not see Willie or Short Round again after this throwback adventure, but they’re both indelible characters who, it seems clear, helped mold Indy into the man he came to be. What else can you ask for from a prequel?The fifth — and yes, final — film in the franchise has been dogged by all sorts of decidely unthrilling headlines: James Mangold taking over for Spielberg, an opening sequence that relies on de-aging Ford, questions about where other beloved (and not so beloved) characters fit in here, and a middling Cannes premiere. But, taken on its own merits, “Dial of Destiny” is a rollicking closing chapter for both Indy and the franchise he made his own.Mostly set in 1969 (more than a decade after the events of “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull”), Mangold’s film actually opens in 1944, at the height of Indy’s beating-back-Nazis campaign, this time accompanied by pal Basil Shaw (Toby Jones) as the duo attempt to wrest a (possibly magical) artifact from falling into the wrong hands (Nazis, of course, led by Mads Mikkelsen as a devious doctor with a twisted plan). More than two decades later, these players (and newbies) reunite for one more globe-trotting adventure.In the interest of not spoiling what’s to come — beyond a damn good time at the multiplex! — we will say that, while Mangold’s film takes a bit of time to get going, once it does, “Dial of Destiny” absolutely feels like a classic Indy-venture. There’s a new sidekick (a very good Phoebe Waller-Bridge), old friends (like John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, and maybe more…), exotic locales, thrilling action sequences, and one hell of a Macguffin pulling them all together. Purists might balk at some of the pieces — not directed by Spielberg? what even? — but “Dial of Destiny” is more than just those pieces, a warm, witting, and action-packed send-off that doesn’t skimp on anything and makes good on plenty of promises.A humble ask: watch “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” again. Divorce yourself from the “discourse,” give the fan service a break, and shake off any memories of flying monkeys (plus, yes, yes, a greaser Shia LaBeouf swinging alongside them). There’s good stuff here, from the return of Karen Allen to the fridge-nuking (which is really, actually, truly quite fun!) and Cate Blanchett getting seriously weird. And yes, there’s bad stuff, too, including (sigh) greaser Shia LaBeouf, that deranged monkey-swinging scene, and the most undercooked of MacGuffins in all of Indy lore.But it’s still an Indiana Jones film, and that has to count for something. Even in its weakest moments and silliest sequences, there’s still the joy of seeing our hero trying something new (gruff, tired, and confused as he might be) and attempting to resurrect his hero for a new generation.Enjoy the fun, forget the limp, and just remember: there’s another sequel after this one, and it’s worth the whiplash to get to it.",

        "content": "Joseph Fiennes quickly fell out of love with Miramax following 1998 Best Picture winner “Shakespeare in Love.”Fiennes, who allegedly beat out Daniel Day-Lewis to play the titular British playwright, recalled to The Guardian that producer Harvey Weinstein used a shocking “bullying tactic” after the film‘s release and subsequent Oscar wins. Fiennes was offered a five-picture deal with Miramax, which he turned down.“I have to be careful here,” Fiennes said, before explaining that Weinstein invited him to his hotel room to aggressively detail the proposed contract. According to Fiennes, Weinstein said “shocking” things and confirmed that he would be entirely in charge of Fiennes’ career going forward. If Fiennes refused, he would not work in Hollywood again.“It was a bullying tactic that didn’t sit well,” Fiennes said, noting he was unaware of the rape and sexual assault allegations against Weinstein at the time; the claims came to light in 2017. “The way he explained it was a shock to me. But I suddenly sat in the room very present, and happy and strong in myself to say, you know what, I’m not beholden to that. I’m stepping away.”Fiennes added that he does not believe parting ways with Weinstein hurt his career in the end.“I don’t think it helped me. Hurt? No, maybe not hurt. But he made it clear that he won’t support me,” the actor said. “He’ll make a very strong movement not to support me. I was out of the family. But I was very happy not to be in the family.”A representative for the incarcerated Weinstein issued a comment to The Independent denying Fiennes’ statement.“Miramax was not offering multi-picture deals and that is as simple as that,” the representative said. “Harvey considers Joe a great actor but believes he is either remembering incorrectly or trying to use Harvey’s name and current status to get this publicity.”Kevin Smith, James Gray, and M. Night Shyamalan have all spoken out about the “personal hell” of collaborating with Miramax.",

David Corenswet will play the lead of Clark Kent/Superman in Gunn’s “Superman: Legacy.” Rachel Brosnahan has been selected as Lois.Corenswet broke out in the A24 horror hit “Pearl.” He’s also known for Netflix’s “Look Both Ways” and HBO miniseries “We Own This City.” Corenswet also wrote, directed, and starred in the web sketch-comedy series “Moe & Jerryweather.” He will next be seen opposite Natalie Portman in the upcoming Apple TV+ limited series “The Lady in the Lake.”Brosnahan just ended her five-season run as the title star in “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.” Brosnahan earned an Emmy Award and two Golden Globes for “Maisel.” She was nominated for an 2015 Emmy for “House of Cards.” Brosnahan recently starred opposite Benedict Cumberbatch in Lionsgate’s “The Courier,” and alongside Christoph Waltz and Willem Dafoe in director Walter Hill’s 2022 western “Dead for a Dollar.”“Superman: Legacy” tells the story of Superman’s journey to reconcile his Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing as Clark Kent of Smallville, Kansas. He is the embodiment of truth, justice, and the American way, guided by human kindness in a world that sees kindness as old-fashioned. Gunn will direct from his screenplay based on characters from DC. The Superman character was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.The high-stakes film is being produced by Peter Safran (“Aquaman” and “The Conjuring”), Gunn’s co-chairman & CEO at DC Studios. “Superman: Legacy” is the first in Gunn and Safran’s new slate of interconnected movies as part of the DCU; it’s scheduled for release on July 11, 2025. A lot is riding on “Superman: Legacy.” This year’s “The Flash” and “Shazam! Fury of the Gods,” both of which were from the prior DC regime, struggled at the box office. To catch Marvel, DC needed a serious reset.As such, the search for a new Kal-El (Supe’s Kryptonian name) has been serious business, and the cap (but hopefully not the red briefs) has been passed around. THR reported on Monday that Gunn had conducted screen tests with other pairings, including Nicholas Hoult and Tom Brittney for Superman, and Emma Mackey and Phoebe Dynevor for Lois.For a while there it looked like there role wasn’t even up for grabs. “Superman: Legacy” follows the brief return of Henry Cavill to the role of Superman in a post-credits stinger following the “Black Adam” film with Dwayne Johnson. After Cavill had announced he would return, Gunn and Safran took the universe — and the gig — in a different direction.",

        "title": "How the Most Romantic Scene in ‘Past Lives’ Gets Past the Language Barrier",
        "content": "“Past Lives” opens with three people at a New York bar while the other patrons wonder who they are to each other. Celine Song’s film then spends most of its runtime unraveling that question. Nora (Greta Lee) and Hae Sung (Teo Yoo) were childhood sweethearts in Korea before Nora’s family immigrated to Canada. They reconnected online briefly in their 20s but work, ambition, and life pushed them apart. Now they’ve met for the first time in two decades, along with Nora’s husband, Arthur (John Magaro), who could be, by his own admission, an interloper standing in the way of a star-crossed romance. But Arthur is something else entirely, and what he and Hae Sung are to each other is where the A24 film derives much of its poignancy. It’s ultimately a film about how the places we’re in shape us, and as bittersweet as it is that Hae Sung and Nora are never in the right place to be together, their connection brings Hae Sung and Arthur together. Highlighting the magic of that connection led to Song and cinematographer Shabier Kirchner lighting the sequence between the two men like a cinematic cross between an Edward Hopper painting and an Ella Fitzgerald torch song; the romantic energy of the bar is accentuated as much by the shadows as by the warm orange lights when Nora excuses herself to use the restroom, and the two men face each other over the empty space left by the woman they both love. “Greta Lee was in the video village while that scene was being shot. And she was like, ‘This is the hottest thing I’ve ever seen.’ And I was like, ‘Exactly,’” Song told IndieWire’s Filmmaker Toolkit podcast. Song accentuates a sense of shared respect and loss between Arthur and Hae Sung, its own kind of intimacy, through the soundtrack. “They’re not friends. But they’re not really — you can’t really say that they’re rivals. That’s not how they’re treating each other. They’re kind of an acquaintance, but a little bit deeper than that because they both care for this woman and they know this woman differently. That’s why the song [in that scene] is John Cale’s ‘You Know More Than I Know.’” Song said. “[It’s] the perfect song for them because that’s what it is. Part of it is the mystery that they have for each other, and they’re actually making room for that mystery for each other and in each other.” Song wrote the film in both Korean and English but acknowledged that there’s a special magic when the film lives between languages, time zones, and cities. “This movie is actually about the difference in languages, and it’s about language gap. When Arthur says, ‘Hey, nice to meet you,’ in Korean and then when Hae Sung said, ‘Hey, nice to meet you,’ in English, when that moment happens, that’s where the movie lives.” Song uses changes in light and shot scale to reinforce, in the parlance of another deeply romantic film, that the problems of three people don’t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. The bar sequence between Hae Sung and Arthur is in many ways the exception that proves the rule: an intimate sequence where both men are equally matched. It is Hae Sung’s connection to Arthur, as much as his connection to Nora, that is the miracle. Their bond is also a kind of in-yun, which doesn’t have a direct counterpart in English but captures how both special and circumstantial it is to encounter the people who affect our lives. “It’s completely magic what they’re sharing in that moment, because for some reason [they both] ended up here, and now, ‘We’re going to talk about in-yun, because that’s who we are. We are in-yun to each other and how amazing that this woman that we both love in some deep way is able to connect us,’” Song said.Nothing is sexier than setting aside your feelings for the benefit of someone you love and someone else acknowledging that sacrifice. It’s not only why the scene is designed in the way that Song, Kirchner, and production designer Grace Yun lay it out, but it’s the final piece to understanding something important about both Arthur and Hae Sung. “To me, that’s what is so interesting about masculinity,” Song said. “The strength to set themselves aside, to care for another person, to tell the other person, ‘It’s OK. I’m OK and you’re OK and we’re good.’” ",

        "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Admits She Still Doesn’t Totally Understand ‘Mother!’",
        "content": "Jennifer Lawrence‘s advice to actors struggling to understand their own movies? Strike up a romantic relationship with your director.Lawrence dished on Darren Aronofsky‘s 2017 mind-bending film “Mother!” during a recent “Watch What Happens Live” with Andy Cohen appearance. The “No Hard Feelings” actress admitted that she still does not totally understand the film, despite her intimate background knowledge of the script.Host Cohen asked, “On a scale of one to totally confused, how much did you understand your film ‘Mother!’?”Lawrence replied, “I’m going to be honest. Well, I was sleeping with the director so I had CliffsNotes. So…five? Or a four. But if anybody needs any tips on understanding their films, you know what to do.”Cohen asked, “Fuck the director?” to which Lawrence quipped, “Yeah!”In Aronofsky’s fall 2017 Biblical parable, Lawrence starred as an unnamed pregnant woman married to an unnamed, godlike man played by Javier Bardem. She’s rapidly terrorized by an onslaught of house guests who descend upon the mansion they share and wreak havoc on their lives.Oscar-winner Lawrence recently reflected elsewhere on the physical toll of starring in Aronofsky’s box office bomb. Lawrence said during an appearance on the YouTube series “Hot Ones” that she still suffers from the on-set injuries.“I tore my diaphragm and cracked something in my chest,” she said. “My top rib, it still clicks to this day.”At the time of the film’s release, Lawrence opened up about going to a “darker place than I’ve ever been in my life,” saying, “I didn’t know if I’d be able to come out OK.”Lawrence also claimed during the “Mother!” press tour that Aronofsky wanted to keep filming during emotionally and physically toiling moments.“I have oxygen tubes in my nostrils, and Darren’s like, ‘It was out of focus; we’ve got to do it again,’” Lawrence said. “And I was just like, ‘Go fuck yourself.'”Jennifer Lawrence has seldom spoken publicly about her short-lived relationship with Aronofsky, though in 2018, she said she couldn’t make it through Paul Thomas Anderson’s “Phantom Thread” because the film may have hit too close to home: “Is [Reynolds Woodcock] kind of like a narcissistic sociopath and he’s an artist so every girl falls in love him because he makes her feel bad about herself and that’s the love story? I haven’t seen it, so I don’t know. I’ve been down that road, I know what that’s like, I don’t need to watch that movie.”",

        "content": "And you thought your work week was bad: Try surviving five nights at a Chuck E. Cheese-esque murder house.The beloved campy video game series “Five Nights at Freddy’s” has landed a live-action film, with Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lillard portraying unhinged security guards at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, where the animatronic corporate mascots come to life at night. Jim Henson’s Creature Shop is behind bringing the toys to life for the big screen.Based on the horror survival video game series of the same name, “Five Nights at Freddy’s” is directed by Emma Tammi (“The Wind,” “Into the Dark”). Tammi co-wrote the film with video game creator Scott Cawthon, who self-published the hit game in 2014. Seth Cuddeback also co-wrote the script.“Five Nights at Freddy’s” was filmed in New Orleans, with horror outfit Blumhouse producing along with Striker Entertainment. Creator Cawthon produces with Jason Blum and executive producer Russell Binder.“Five Nights at Freddy’s” has spurred nine sequels, multiple spinoff games, comic books, and a novel trilogy. The film adaptation comes on the heels of fellow toy-centric movie “Barbie” and viral video game adaptation series “The Last of Us.”Production company Blumhouse additionally announced a “horror-themed” video game branch in February 2023, with Zach Wood as president of Blumhouse Games and Dan Sechler as CFO. Per a press release, Blumhouse Games will partner with independent game developers on original games for console, PC, and mobile platforms. It will focus on indie-budget games (below $10 million), which fits with the company’s low-budget “spirit of its film business.”Also noted, Blumhouse and Atomic Monster are looking to merge; a deal is expected to be solidified this summer.“Five Nights at Freddy’s” premieres October 27 in theaters from Universal Pictures and on Peacock the same day.

        "content": "Is there such thing as a sympathetic cause for treason?Magnolia Pictures documentary “A Compassionate Spy,” directed by two-time Oscar nominee Steve James (“Hoop Dreams,” “Life Itself”), captures the controversial true story of Manhattan Project physicist Ted Hall. Part of the team behind J. Robert Oppenheimer’s atomic bomb, Hall shared nuclear secrets with the Soviet Union. The documentary is told through the perspective of Ted’s wife Joan Hall, who protected his secret across their 50-year marriage.The official “Compassionate Spy” synopsis reads: Recruited in 1944 as an 18-year-old Harvard undergraduate to help J. Robert Oppenheimer and his team create a bomb, Ted Hall was the youngest physicist on the Manhattan Project, and didn’t share his colleagues’ elation after the successful detonation of the world’s first atomic bomb. Concerned that a U.S. post-war monopoly on such a powerful weapon could lead to nuclear catastrophe, Hall began passing key information about the bomb’s construction to the Soviet Union. After the war, he met, fell in love with, and married Joan, a fellow student with whom he shared a passion for classical music and socialist causes — and the explosive secret of his espionage. The pair raised a family while living under a cloud of suspicion and years of FBI surveillance and intimidation.“A Compassionate Spy” premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival ahead of its North American launch at Telluride. The film is distributed by Magnolia Pictures and will be released on the heels of Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” which fictionalizes the creation of the bomb itself. “Oppenheimer” will be released in theaters July 21 and used real scientists in Los Alamos as extras.“We have to be really on our game, we have to be faithful to the history here, and really know what we’re up to,” director Christopher Nolan explained, citing that the first explosion of the atomic bomb in the Trinity test will be shown onscreen in the upcoming film sans CGI.IndieWire’s David Ehrlich wrote in the review for “A Compassionate Spy” that the harrowing true story is completely separate from “Oppenheimer.”“[Director] James doesn’t have access to the same toolkit on a low-budget documentary that someone like Christopher Nolan might have at his disposal while making an $100 million biopic about Robert Oppenheimer,” Ehrlich penned.He added that “A Compassionate Spy” is “extremely sympathetic toward Hall’s choice,” with director James classifying Ted Hall’s as the “lesser of two evils” when it comes to the international nuclear arms race today. Ehrlich wrote, “The rabid nationalism that might convince some modern viewers to see Hall as a villain is exactly what scared him into contacting the Soviets.”“A Compassionate Spy” is presented by Participant and is a Mitten Media and Kartemquin Films production produced by Mark Mitten p.g.a., Dave Lindorff, and Steve James.

        "title": "Can We Stop Talking About the Female Nudity in ‘No Hard Feelings’ and ‘The Idol’? (Opinion)",
        "content": "Last week’s new release “No Hard Feelings” has already stirred up some tough emotions for its audience — and not about the so-called “raunchy” and “offensive” comedy at the center of the Jennifer Lawrence-led feature. Instead — and predictably enough — the media narrative has centered on what is missing from the movie…namely, all of Lawrence’s clothes in a scene that sees skinny-dipping turned into a brawl.Why, in 2023, do audiences still care so much? Both Lawrence’s agency as an actress and producer, as well as her choice to be naked, are undermined by questioning the merits of going full frontal, and sadly, that’s what much of the criticism surrounding “No Hard Feelings” is focused on.In the film, Lawrence portrays down-on-her-luck Uber driver/bartender Maddie, who struggles to live in the wealthy beach town of Montauk after rapid gentrification. Maddie answers a Craigslist ad from a rich couple looking to hire a woman to give their 19-year-old son, Percy (Andrew Barth Feldman), more “experience” dating before he goes off to Princeton. During one of Maddie’s first attempts to seduce Percy, she invites him to go skinny-dipping. The only issue other than Percy not wanting to have sex is that their clothes are stolen by obnoxious teens, whom Maddie fights while naked at the beach at night.The brief (and hilarious) “No Hard Feelings” nude sequence has been debated on Twitter by critics calling Lawrence’s stripped-down battle with teens a “gratuitous” focus on her naked body. One journalist coming out of the film’s premiere screening last week wondered whether it was a deepfake or body double, though Lawrence has already addressed the choice as both an actress and a producer, telling People magazine that she “took a deep breath and then disrobed.”The Oscar winner told Variety that she even had to convince her own team that it was worth going fully nude.“Everyone in my life and my team is doing the right thing and going, ‘Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure?'” Lawrence said. “I didn’t even have a second thought. It was hilarious to me.”It feels important, albeit irrelevant, to point out that the full frontal scene is entirely sexless; there is no romance, no lingering camera gaze, and no ogling of Lawrence’s postpartum physique onscreen. Nope, that dialogue is all happening offscreen as various audience members and critics perpetuate the discourse around so-called excessive and unnecessary full-frontal nudity, especially when it comes to female stars.Sure, there was a brief, cutesy comic debate over the male nudity in the porn magazine comedy “Minx,” but it was all very PG. “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” has been thrust back into the conversation amid rom-com full frontal in “No Hard Feelings,” but in that film, Jason Segal’s penis was intended as a showcase of sexual vulnerability.Now, an R-rated coming-of-age comedy that has zero actual sex scenes is somehow being deemed “offensive” by its own stars in a seemingly defensive media tactic assuring us that no, the movie is not promoting sex work. The enhanced criticism and assumptions around the level of raunchiness for “No Hard Feelings” is due in part to the initial reception of an Academy Award winner’s choice to strip down for the sake of a laugh.And that choice could also be traced back to the infamous 2014 nude photo leak, which Lawrence called a “sex crime” as internet users could see her naked “without my consent, any time of the day” forever.“I was just so afraid, I didn’t know how this would affect my career,” Lawrence told Vanity Fair in 2021 reflecting on the hack. Lawrence’s decision to disrobe for “No Hard Feelings” is instead her own choice, and makes a statement on the ownership over her own body’s image.Lawrence additionally told Vogue last year amid the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision, “Get the government out of my snatch,” and honestly, same goes for film critics and Twitter users.“It’s too personal to a female’s existence to watch white men debate over uteruses when they from the bottom of their hearts can’t find a clitoris,” Lawrence said at the time.Does the disrespect for women’s bodies need to extend beyond politics, doctors’ offices, and religious debates and now into film criticism?“No Hard Feelings” is far from the only female-led project featuring female nudity that has recently been defended and explained by its lead actress. In a similar “strong yet messy female lead” saga, Lily-Rose Depp‘s star-making performance in the controversial HBO series “The Idol” is being overshadowed by labels that the show is pornographic amid media backlash.Depp leads the show as a down-on-her-luck pop star who, like “No Hard Feelings” lead Maddie, is grieving over the loss of her mother and clawing to find a way to maintain her lifestyle while staying true to her voice.Creators Sam Levinson and Abel “The Weeknd” Tesfaye have frequently responded to claims of an allegedly predatory vision involving Depp; meanwhile, the actress stood by the series throughout its marketing campaign and denied feeling pressured to bare more.“There are many women who have felt exploited by the nudity they’ve done and have thought, ‘I didn’t feel great about that.’ But, I’m comfortable performing in that way, I enjoy it,” Depp told The New York Times. “It informed the character. In the conversation around the risqué aspects, there’s the implication that it’s something being consistently imposed upon women. Obviously, that has been true a lot historically.”“Euphoria” showrunner Levinson added of Depp’s character, “I believe people will underestimate Jocelyn as a character because of how exposed she is.” Isn’t that exactly what “The Idol” viewers are doing, both for Depp’s real-life agency and that of her character?Jocelyn knows she’s self-destructive. That’s the whole point of the series. She’s in control of her desire to be out of control; as much as sketchy club owner Tedros (Tesfaye) is using Jocelyn for clout, she’s using him right back to dismantle her own former child star image and clean house for her creative team. Jocelyn wants to change how she is perceived by her public, and someone as unhinged as Tedros coming into her inner circle is the quickest way to do it. Or, as the most recent episode hinted at, Jocelyn knew exactly what she was doing — and who she was manipulating with her sexuality — all along.“The Idol” actress Jane Adams, for one, anticipated the backlash to the show’s nudity in conversation with Yahoo! Entertainment.“I would say… with Lily-Rose, like why would nudity be a bad thing? What are people talking about?” Adams said. “I don’t understand. I don’t even believe that mindset is real. That whole mindset seems fake to me, this outrage and pearl-clutching that’s going on about a nude actress who’s beautiful. When did that become outrageous?”“The Idol” has been criticized for scandalous sequences, including a cringe “sex” scene that was again, actually sexless, during which Tedros essentially reads aloud most millennials’ Hinge chat threads while Jocelyn masturbates on a bed. The internet went berserk.As for the nudity, Jocelyn is most nude while still wearing clothes. You read that right: The majority of her outfits consist of sheer dresses, black thongs, and no bra. When Tedros purrs with no doubt sour breath that he wants to “see her tits,” he can literally already see Jocelyn’s breasts, which are only concealed by a crop top with the same consistency as a shower curtain. Is this really “gratuitous” nudity: wearing an outfit that we can buy at Urban Outfitters this very minute?And when there really could be male gaze-y over-the-top nudity onscreen, like when Jocelyn takes a shower, the camera stays strictly above her collarbones. Are we really trying to say that Jocelyn (and, in a sad, blurred line, Depp herself) deserves such internet hate because of what she was wearing?There is a slew of other problems with “The Idol,” ones that IndieWire’s Ben Travers has deftly unpacked and discussed. The perpetuation of Jocelyn’s abuse, portrayed as her conditioned choice, is glaringly underdeveloped thus far in the series, and it seems that we won’t be getting a sensitive mental health resolution to Jocelyn’s self-harm spiral at this pace. Yet when it comes to the singular critique of her so-called excessive nudity, the internet has missed the mark.Within the merits of nudity, there is a deeper double standard between comedy and drama, or the purpose behind what the female naked body onscreen is trying to convey. “No Hard Feelings” would be a very different film if the gender roles were reversed. A 32-year-old man being hired to date a 19-year-old woman? No, thanks. But would the backlash and arguably overbearing media campaign still be necessary? Is this because it’s an “unlikeable woman” who strips down or an Oscar-winning actress?Lawrence is already facing increased scrutiny in the limelight amid seeming media fatigue over her celebrity status. “The Idol” creator Levinson, meanwhile, is used to being criticized, mostly for his loose approach to production on “Euphoria” and allegedly asking Sydney Sweeney for more nude scenes onscreen, which Sweeney later debunked. While there have not been any “The Idol” rumors around Depp’s consent for stripping as Jocelyn, why does the internet seem to be anticipating such? Or, rather, why is there a need to blame a man in power for a woman’s right to show her body?Lawrence, a certified bankable movie star and one of the most iconic actresses of the 21st century, is an executive producer on “No Hard Feelings” and yet still her decision to strip down is questioned. Depp, the daughter of Oscar nominee Johnny Depp and a rising actress in her own right, is inherently aware of Hollywood itself. The intimacy coordinator scene in “The Idol” premiere plays as a snarky commentary parodying the obsession with being buttoned-up: Jocelyn is alone shooting her album cover, wants to show her breasts, but cannot due to her contract. It’s the same subversive nature into which “The Idol” media circus has spiraled: Depp wants to do this, but a young woman clearly cannot be capable of making that decision herself, according to how the series has been received.Both Lawrence and Depp’s respective performances have become entangled with their real-life personas, and the narrative only continues to undermine the profession of being a female-identifying star.And, amid the questioning of why Lawrence and Depp would go nude, there is no mention of Cynthia Nixon’s full frontal scene in “And Just Like That.” Similar to “No Hard Feelings,” Miranda (Nixon) is completely naked in a comedic sequence during which she folds herself into (and quickly out of) a sensory deprivation tank. Nixon has portrayed Miranda for more than 25 years and recently told Entertainment Tonight that she is “fairly game” for anything in character, including getting totally naked since “Sex and the City” is, well, about sex. So, what types of female bodies are being deemed as “gratuitously” naked, and others being labeled as “brave” due to seniority?The discrepancy between reactions is inherently tied to viewers’ inherent puritanical response to sexualize certain bodies and not others; any backlash vocalized is really in response to their own personal reactions, not the content itself. The hard feelings onscreen female nudity inspire? That’s something audiences will just need to handle themselves.",

        "title": "James Gunn Is Tired of ‘Lazy’ Superhero Movies with ‘No Rhyme or Reason to What’s Happening’",
        "content": "James Gunn has been one of the most prolific comic book filmmakers of the 21st century, but even he understands why people get bored of the genre.In a new appearance on the “Inside of You” podcast, the newly minted DC Studios co-CEO explained how he hopes to avoid the franchise fatigue that has led to waning public interest in some superhero properties.“We’re going to be very careful with the product that we put out and making sure everything is as good as it can possibly be,” Gunn said.Gunn offered his diagnosis for what he sees as a decline in superhero movie quality, explaining that he thinks studios often push ahead with sequels and reboots before finding the narrative justification for the films.“People have gotten really lazy with their superhero stories,” he said. “And they have gotten to the place where, ‘Oh, it’s a superhero, let’s make a movie about it.’ And then, ‘Oh, let’s make a sequel, because the first one did pretty well,’ and they aren’t thinking about, ‘Why is this story special? What makes this story stand apart from other stories? What is the story at the heart of it all? Why is this character important? What makes this story different that it fills a need for people in theaters to go see?’”Gunn added that he believes some recent movies have placed too much emphasis on spectacle at the expense of character.“People have gotten a little lazy and there’s a lot of biff, pow, bam stuff happening in movies and I’m watching third acts of superhero films where I really just don’t feel like there’s a rhyme or reason to what’s happening,” he said. “I don’t care about the characters. And they’ve gotten too generic.”This weekend’s box office is an indication of superhero fatigue, as non-Gunn DC title “The Flash” in its second weekend sunk in theaters while non-franchise movies thrived.Gunn said that he hopes to combat the repetition by working a variety of genres into his DC Universe. His first slate will begin with 2025’s “Superman: Legacy” and include projects as varied as a “Swamp Thing” horror movie and a Green Lantern series said to be inspired by “True Detective.”“I like very serious superhero movies, and I like very comedic superhero movies,” he said. “I like ones that are a murder mystery but it’s with superheroes. I like to see these different types of stories, as opposed to seeing the same story told over and over again.”",

        "title": "Angela Bassett Says Laurence Fishburne Shut Down Long Hours on Rape Scene for ‘What’s Love Got to Do With It?’",
        "content": "Angela Bassett credits Laurence Fishburne for keeping her sane on set of intense 1993 Tina Turner biopic “What’s Love Got to Do With It?.”Bassett, who received her first Oscar nomination for portraying rock legend Tina onscreen, told Variety during the 30th anniversary of the film that Fishburne stepped in when production got “out of hand,” such as filming a rape scene between Tina (Bassett) and husband Ike Turner (Fishburne) for 16 hours.“We were not willing to do what history had shown us on set over the last few months, that we would do it over and over and over again for 16 hours. I wasn’t willing to do that,” Bassett said of filming the assault scene. “And I knew I couldn’t ask the director [Brian Gibson] because, here I am as a new actor, but I could talk to Laurence. So Laurence asked me, ‘How many times you want to do this?’ And I looked at him, he took my hand and I said, ‘Four or five.’ And then he told the director, like, ‘Hey man, we’re just going to do this four times. So let’s make sure we get the cameras right and we’re going to keep them outside of the studio.'”Bassett and Fishburne previously had starred in “Boyz n the Hood” together which, according to Bassett, had “undergirded our camaraderie with one another.” The duo had also been slated to appear in film “Death Rose” that never got made.“There was this history of chemistry and a respect of each other as people and as artists,” Bassett said of Fishburne. “At first, he said he wasn’t interested in playing the role of Ike. Laurence was doing his thing. He was a well-respected actor in our community up to that point. Once I was cast, I was like, ‘You know, brother, if you don’t want to, I respect you enough. I love you.’ And that’s all I said to him. And then a couple of days later, I get a call and he said, ‘Hey, you want to get married?’ And I knew exactly what that meant.”Bassett continued of Fishburne’s casting, “The filmmaker was right. He was the best Ike. He was strong, he was respectful. He could bring order and he had discipline. When things got out of hand, as they did, he could bring some stoppage and clarity to the moment. We literally worked 16-hour days on the smallest of things, like cutting a ribbon. And whereas I could not, as an up-and-coming actor to this white male British director, Laurence could say, ‘I think we got it. We got it.’ And then we could all go home and get some rest to be ready for the next day. Every day was monumental. There weren’t light days, like, ‘Oh, I get to stand at the edge of the cliff and look out at the ocean.’ No. Every day you’re dancing ‘Proud Mary’ or dealing with something very emotional.”Bassett called the rape scene one of the “particularly hard moments,” adding that the inclusion of Tina’s real-life abuse was necessary for audiences to “feel the enormity” of her pain.“It’s not love making — it is violence and control. It’s manipulative. And as the person portraying it, even though it hasn’t happened to you, you can’t help but feel these things,” Bassett said. “They can seep into your soul. They inhabit your body, your mind, your spirit. And we were willing to give all of ourselves to the moment to get it on tape.”She added of another stunt sequence involving Ike (Fishburne) beating Tina, “Some of the things he did, you may not see the imagery, but you will feel it, you will sense it, you will understand it. You won’t see the actual perpetration of it visually, he as a Black man and me as a Black woman onscreen. But you will take away so much from it.”",

        "content": "Lucrecia Martel is calling out Marvel for what she feels is the films’ poor production quality.The “Zama” director, who previously revealed she was approached by Marvel to helm “Black Widow,” told The Film Stage that she never ended up seeing the 2021 film directed by Cate Shortland.“No, no, no. I didn’t see ‘Black Widow.’ I tried to,” Marvel said. “It turns out some of the Marvel films are available on planes so I’ve seen a few. I find the sound in them is absolutely in very poor taste, the visual effects, and the sound of the effects.”She added, “It’s the selection of the sounds that they’re connecting to the effects, which is actually very ugly. And the way the music is used is actually horrible.”Martel gave more details about her Marvel meetings back in 2018 about “Black Widow.”“They contacted a great number of female directors,” Martel said. “I never would have imagined that Marvel could contact and bring together a pool of directors and I would be a part of it; I never thought that would be possible. I would have loved to make a film with them but I would have had to provide something that I would like to see in that world.”The 2019 head of the Venice Film Festival jury previously revealed that her first Marvel meeting was part of the 10-year anniversary of the studio.“What they told me in the meeting was ‘we need a female director because we need someone who is mostly concerned with the development of Scarlett Johansson’s character,'” Martel said at the time. “They also told me, ‘Don’t worry about the action scenes, we will take care of that.’ I was thinking, well I would love to meet Scarlett Johansson but also I would love to make the action sequences.”She continued, “Companies are interested in female filmmakers but they still think action scenes are for male directors. The first thing I asked them was maybe if they could change the special effects because there’s so many laser lights. I find them horrible. Also the soundtrack of Marvel films is quite horrendous. Maybe we disagree on this but it’s really hard to watch a Marvel film. It’s painful to the ears to watch Marvel films.”",

        "content": "The Academy Board of Governors voted to present Academy Honorary Awards to Angela Bassett, Mel Brooks and editor Carol Littleton and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award to the Sundance Institute’s Michelle Satter. They will accept the four Oscars at the Academy’s 14th Governors Awards event on Saturday, November 18, 2023, at the Fairmont Century Plaza in Los Angeles.“The Academy’s Board of Governors is thrilled to honor four trailblazers who have transformed the film industry and inspired generations of filmmakers and movie fans,” said Academy President Janet Yang in a statement. “Across her decades-long career, Angela Bassett has continued to deliver transcendent performances that set new standards in acting. Mel Brooks lights up our hearts with his humor, and his legacy has made a lasting impact on every facet of entertainment. Carol Littleton’s career in film editing serves as a model for those who come after her. A pillar of the independent film community, Michelle Satter has played a vital role in the careers of countless filmmakers around the world.”Bassett earned a second Oscar nomination for her fierce Queen in “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” following her first, for her breakout role as Tina Turner in “What’s Love Got to Do with It.” Her other film credits include “Boyz N the Hood,” “Malcolm X,” “Waiting to Exhale,” “How Stella Got Her Groove Back,” “Black Panther,” “Mission: Impossible – Fallout,” “Avengers: Endgame,” and “Soul.” Her television credits include “The Jacksons: An American Dream,” “The Rosa Parks Story,” “American Horror Story” and “9-1-1.”Multi-hyphenate director-producer-writer-actor Mel Brooks began his career writing television comedy routines for Sid Caesar and co-created the television series “Get Smart.” In 1967, he wrote and directed his debut feature “The Producers,” which earned him an Oscar for Original Screenplay and which he later adapted into a hit Broadway musical. His films include “The Twelve Chairs,” “Blazing Saddles,” “Young Frankenstein,” “Silent Movie,” “High Anxiety,” “History of the World – Part I,” “Spaceballs,” “Life Stinks,” “Robin Hood: Men in Tights” and “Dracula: Dead and Loving It.”Littleton’s career as a film editor spans nearly five decades. In 1982, she earned an Oscar nomination for Film Editing for “E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial.” Her other credits include “Body Heat,” “The Big Chill,” “Places in the Heart,” and “The Manchurian Candidate.” She has served as governor of the Academy’s Film Editors Branch, president and vice president of the Motion Picture Editors Guild, and is on the Board of Directors of American Cinema Editors.Satter is the founding senior director of the Sundance Institute’s Artist Programs, who has nurtured and supported countless emerging filmmakers at her writing and directing labs over 40 years. The alumnae made the labs famous, ranging from Quentin Tarantino (1991) to Chloé Zhao (2012) and Taika Waititi (2005) to Marielle Heller (2012). Many of them, like Marvel director Ryan Coogler, still turn to Satter for feedback or return to the labs as advisors.Satter and her team never stop trawling for potential fellows and advisors. Satter chased down Paul Thomas Anderson at Sundance 1993 after seeing his short “Cigarettes and Coffee” and invited him to the summer Directors Lab. He brought “Sydney,” which later became “Hard Eight.” Satter invited John Cameron Mitchell to the Directors Lab after she saw “Hedwig & the Angry Inch” off-Broadway, but he didn’t want to direct himself. She brought in Tom Kalin to direct two scenes, asked Mitchell to do the third, and the rest is history.She has also led the Sundance Institute’s international initiatives in Asia, Europe, India, Latin America and the Middle East. She founded and oversees the vision and content of Sundance Collab, a global digital storytelling community and learning platform.The Honorary Award, an Oscar statuette, is given “to honor extraordinary distinction in lifetime achievement, exceptional contributions to the state of motion picture arts and sciences, or for outstanding service to the Academy.”The Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, also an Oscar statuette, is given “to an individual in the motion picture arts and sciences whose humanitarian efforts have brought credit to the industry.”",

        "title": "‘Every Body’ Review: Documentary About the Heartbreaking Secrecy Around Intersex Identities Should Be Mandatory Viewing",
        "content": "“Every Body” is a beautiful and cathartic celebration of intersexuality — and should be mandatory viewing for people of all genders.Directed by Julie Cohen (co-director of the Oscar-nominated “RBG”), the documentary opens with a montage of increasingly ridiculous gender reveals (remember the series of deaths from them a few years ago? Well, it turns out that blowing up cars, shooting rockets, and slinging archery arrows might not always go as planned). The gender reveals set up the crux of the film, which showcases the irrelevance and — frankly — the stupidity of trying to define people based on their bodies.“Every Body” follows three intersex adults — actor and screenwriter River Gallo (they/them), political consultant Alicia Roth Weigel (she/they), and Ph.D. student Sean Saifa Wall (he/him) — who are leading figures in intersex awareness advocacy. Being intersex is defined as “any variation within a person’s sex traits with which they’re either born with or develop naturally during puberty,” according to documentary specialist Katharine Dalke, M.D. who works at the Sexual & Gender Minority Research Group of National Institutes of Health (NIH).In an era in which bodily autonomy is being threatened and intersex people are facing cultural erasure by conservatives talking heads, “Every Body” is a monumental statement that traces the history of intersex awareness in America. Dalke describes being intersex as “that middle space exists between male and female,” saying, “It is possible to be a ‘biological female’ and have testes. It is possible to be a ‘biological male’ and have a uterus.”But it’s plenty more complicated to live in the gray space of a society that largely only recognizes two genders. “Every Body” lead Alicia admits that it’s tougher to date after coming out as intersex, quipping that potential partners will “find out on their own” eventually anyways. Sean similarly opens up about being told he had either a “large clitoris or small phallus” growing up; he later underwent surgery.Sean, Alicia, and River’s respective upbringings and relationships with their parents are also showcased in the documentary, with a backdrop of the “freak show” carnival legacy and a pressure to “be fixed” lurking underneath the trio’s modern determination to dismantle assumptions about chromosome differences.The film also focuses on sex researcher John Money, who infamously urged the parents of David Reimer to pursue infant gender reassessment surgery. David’s penis was horrifically cut off during a botched circumcision; at the time, Money recommended David’s testicles also be removed and for David to be raised as “Brenda” alongside his identical twin brother Brian. Money continued to treat David, who later alleged Money sexually abused him. David found out about the gender surgery at age 14 and lived out the remainder of his life as David before committing suicide in 2004 at age 38.In “Every Body,” filmmaker River watches clips of David’s mother speaking on “Dateline,” and Money lecturing about the so-called merits of the surgery. “Every Body” director Cohen is a former “Dateline” producer and was inspired to pursue “Every Body” after seeing the Reimer episode in the archives.“Every Body” finds its strength in staying in the present, however, with Alicia, Sean, and River forging their own path as activists and testifying across the U.S. River, who is among IndieWire’s rising LGBTQ+ filmmakers, is set to helm upcoming feature “Ponyboi,” based on their Tribeca-selected short film of the same name.The feature will follow an intersex runaway sex worker who tries to escape his New Jersey hometown. Dylan O’Brien, Victoria Pedretti, and Indya Moore star in “Ponyboi,” which was inspired by River’s own past. “Every Body” marks an important stepping stone not just for River’s own personal history and evolution — but a vital document for all audiences willing to explore what it means to truly honor one’s genuine self.Focus Features will release “Every Body” in theaters on Friday, June 30.",

        "title": "What’s It Like at a Screenwriting-Focused Film Festival During the Strike?",
        "content": "Most festivals don’t want protests. This one encouraged a picket line to form.The Nantucket Film Festival, which took place June 21-26 on the foggy isle 30 miles off the Massachusetts coast, is uniquely oriented toward the craft of screenwriting. Stars certainly appear — Allison Williams brought the glamour this year — but pen and paper are more important here than primping and pompadours.The WGA has been a longtime partner of the festival, and the biggest gala event was a Screenwriters Tribute honoring Ken Burns and Lynn Novick, the “To All the Boys I Loved Before” scribe Jenny Han, and Nicole Holofcener, whose “You Hurt My Feelings” screened in the lineup. That film is literally about an author, and so were several others that showed, including Christian Petzold’s “Afire.” (“My Sailor, My Love” won the Narrative Feature Audience Award, while “The Saint of Second Chances” and “Hung Up on a Dream” won the Documentary Feature Audience Award.) And the biggest competition isn’t built around established names at all, but a screenplay contest geared toward finding new talent.At a time when the WGA strike has caused many writers to avoid FYC events and simply apply their way with words to creating pithy signs for the picket line, the Nantucket Film Festival stood apart from the march to awards season and focused on supporting the ability of writers to write. It culminated with a festival-sanctioned picket line at the island’s main public library, the Atheneum.“We’re not a marketplace,” festival director Mystelle Brabbee said. “But we take pride in helping to form connections for writers.”“This is not a marketplace where everyone’s selling, selling, selling,” said veteran TV writer Donick Cary (Letterman, “The Simpsons,” “Silicon Valley”) at a “Screenwriters’ State of the Union” panel I moderated. “But there’s a lot of very creative conversations going on with people across the entire entertainment spectrum and also people outside of it. It’s a really great place to wander around and have conversations. The documentary I made for Netflix, ‘Have a Good Trip: Adventures in Psychedelics,’ came out of just a conversation at the film festival. [Ben Stiller and Fisher Stevens were] like, ‘We should make that. Let’s talk about it.’ That otherwise would’ve taken six months to set up that meeting and do a pitch.”The festival is especially an incubator for writing talent via its screenplay competition, which recognizes outstanding writing among features, shorts, and episodic offerings. None of the writers are “names” — yet. (Debra Granik was a winner of this award at the start of her career.) But winning their category means a return trip to Nantucket in the fall for a month-long writers’ retreat and mentorship program. Last year’s feature screenplay winner, Michael Lei, received hands-on assistance to make his screenplay that much better from the mentor assigned to him, “Judas and the Black Messiah” director Shaka King.“This mentorship program was really special because [the mentors] stay with you for a weekend,” Lei said. “You are eating, drinking, hiking, watching films with them. It’s a very organic personal connection.”That personal connection expresses itself during the festival as well with a unique event called Late Night Storytelling, where writers take the mic and show off their storytelling ability, each story existing in that space between rehearsed and extemporaneous. “Late Show with Stephen Colbert” writer Opus Moreschi particularly rocked the crowd with his raucous story about getting appendicitis while on a cruise to Saint Martin.Sophie Barthes, the director of this year’s Sundance premiere “The Pod Generation” helped get her start because of this mentorship program when she won the feature screenplay award in 2006. She wrote that film, “Cold Souls,” with Paul Giamatti in mind to star, and met Giamatti at Nantucket after winning the award, pitched it to him, and he indeed agreed to star. The film was released three years later.Helping to develop writing talent is one thing, but advocating for an equitable business environment in which they can work is another. And that’s where the Nantucket Film Festival is particularly unique, splashing photos from the picket line on their Instagram and incorporating messages of what the WGA strike is advocating for throughout. (“Good luck making it without a paid writer,” tribute gala host Brian Williams said, amid jabs about the Nantucket weather and bawdy jokes about his daughter.)In the Screenwriters’ State of the Union panel, Barthes acknowledged the difficult financial reality of being a feature writer in particular. “When you’re asked for a rewrite, it’s actually two months that you’re going to be rewriting, unpaid. Unless you’re directing as well, for the amount of time your screenplay is in development you’ll be paid less than the intern.”Roughly at the same time the festival began, some news broke from the nearby Cape Cod town of Chatham: a WGA picket line had forced a work stoppage of the new six-part Netflix series “The Perfect Couple,” starring Nicole Kidman and Liev Schreiber and based on Elin Hilderbrand’s novel.“I think this is affecting the industry in a lot of places, not just LA and New York,” Cary said. “It’s North Carolina and Atlanta too, and everywhere there’s production.” The film festival in Nantucket itself underscored that — the issues facing screenwriters are the same everywhere, even on this rocky outcropping of an island that can feel cut off from the rest of the world.",

        "content": "Natasha Lyonne‘s Hollywood rise took her the better part of two decades. Before she emerged as one of the top showrunners of the prestige TV era after the success of “Russian Doll” in 2019, she found success as a teen star in films like “But I’m a Cheerleader” and the “Poker Face” star has some thoughts about the way some critics discussed her earlier work.In a new interview with The Independent, Lyonne recalled an initial burst of fame when she starred in “But I’m a Cheerleader” alongside Clea DuVall in 1999. Some writers praised her for playing a gay character and promoting the film in gay publications, as if doing so was an act of courage.“It was the most offensive thing in the world,” Lyonne saidr. “Like when they’d say to Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, too, how ‘courageous’ it is. Fuck you! How dare you say that? Or like, ‘Why are you on the cover of Out Magazine with Clea DuVall but you’re not identifying as gay?’ Like, fuck you! It’s the cover of Out Magazine and Clea and I fucking love each other to death. So we’re gonna do our sexy little photoshoot. Nipples out, baby, let’s go! That’s why!”Lyonne reiterated her support for the LGBTQ community and explained that she has no patience for people who try to make life more difficult for anyone based on immutable characteristics.“Believe me, everyone is having a hard enough time being a human being all by themselves – straight, gay, fucking white and Black alike,” she said. “Like we’re all on this ride together trying to figure out why we’re supposed to work so hard knowing that we die in the end. We’re all in the same existential problem. So the idea that you’re gonna make it more difficult by causing unnecessary suffering? I hate it. I really just can’t stand for it.”",

        "title": "‘John Wick’ Director Says Oscar for Best Stuntwork Will Happen, Academy Talks ‘Incredibly Positive’",
        "content": "The success of the “John Wick” movies has highlights the artistry that goes into stunt work and franchise director Chad Stahelski has become one of the strongest advocates for honoring stunts at the Oscars. The filmmaker has long been vocal about his desire to see a new stunt-focused category added to the Academy Awards — and now his efforts may pay off.In an interview with ComicBookMovie.com, Stahelski said he met with decision makers at the Academy and believes his vision will come to fruition soon.“We’ve been meeting with members of the Academy and actually having these conversations, and, to be honest, it’s been nothing but incredibly positive, incredibly instructional,” Stahelski said. “I think, for the first time, we’ve made real movement forward to making this happen.”Stahelski said that the biggest roadblocks are logistical ones. Stunt work is a collaborative art form and awards could theoretically go to a variety of departments.“The question is, we haven’t had the real talks about how do you even determine what to award,” he said. “Like, is it for best stunt? Is it best choreography? Best action sequence? Best stunt ensemble? Does the stunt coordinator get it? The guy doing the gag get it? The martial arts choreographer? The fight choreography? The stunt double? The second unit director? The editor? Who gets the award? All these are great questions that just need to be talked about by smart individuals on both sides of it, the stunt community and the Academy.”The filmmaker ultimately reiterated his confidence in the Oscars adding a stunt category, saying it’s a matter of when rather than if.“For the last three months, we’ve been talking to members of the Academy, getting this huge machine up and running to have these discussions and, again, to be open and fair about both sides,” he said. “Both sides have been incredibly positive. There is no one that we’ve met so far that thinks antagonistically to this like everybody on both sides wants this to happen. They want stunts at the Oscars. It’s going to happen. It’s just how do we do it as fair and as thought out as possible.”",

        "title": "As ‘The Flash’ Collapses, This Weekend Set the Wrong Kind of Box-Office Record",
        "content": "On a weekend like this one it’s easy to bury the positive news, so let’s start with the good stuff.Three non-franchise original films, all budgeted under $50 million, saw credible results. Sony’s “No Hard Feelings” with Jennifer Lawrence, an R-rated comedy, did around 25 percent better than pre-release estimates (around $15 million, compared to $12 million, pending Sunday actuals). Wes Anderson’s “Asteroid City” (Focus) proved its opening platform weekend was no fluke with $9 million (in 1,675 theaters, less than half of a normal wide run). And Celine Song’s “Past Lives” (A24), rolling out more slowly, is already at $3.5 million while in fewer than 300 theaters.Add to those the continued strong performance of “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” (Sony), which is back at #1 and headed to a $375 million-$400 million domestic total (double 2018’s initial entry). Pixar’s “Elemental” saw a credible hold (-38 percent) to retain the #2 position. And “The Little Mermaid,” falling only 22 percent, is at $270 million domestic, while Disney’s “Boogeyman” (its fourth top 10 title) fell only 40 percent. It’s headed to over $40 million, a credible showing for a lower-budget original in the heart of the summer, and equal or better to its sleeper “Barbarian” last fall.That’s not bad for any given box office weekend. Here’s the rub: It’s not. It is the heart of the summer and not a single film grossed more than $20 million. A late June weekend like this often sees openings over $100 million, multiple films over $30 million, and a total gross of $200 million or higher.This weekend is about $110 million (pending Sunday results — the order for the Top 10 looks correct, but some of the estimates might be a bit high). It is the second-worst June weekend in 20 years by a considerable margin (excluding 2020-2021). In 2019, the last normal year, the weekend grossed $164 million.Part of the shortfall stems from the continued weakness of “The Flash” (Warner Bros. Discovery). The DC Comics film fell 72 percent from its weak $55 million start, adding only $15 million to the weekend. Other studios gave it a wide berth (seen in only the counterprogramming of “No Hard Feelings”), anticipating perhaps a $40 million second stanza.However, some of the blame goes to “Elemental.” As a summer Pixar title in its second weekend, it would be expected to capture at least $40 million; it grossed $18.5 million.The weekend’s total is down $25 million from last year and the summer remains around three percent ahead of last year. Though there are prospects for improvement ahead, this projects to a $3.5 billion season, below optimistic hopes. If that’s the case, and 2023 continues its 21 percent jump over 2022, that would put the year at $8.9 billion.Success for “No Hard Feelings” remains to be seen. Initial foreign results gets it to just under $25 million. Its $45 million budget (marketing might double the cost) demands a three times or better multiple.Weekend projections for “Asteroid City” were an optimistic $6 million, making $9 million a huge win for Focus and for specialized film. It expanded more rapidly, but that performance is better than any single week for “Everything Everywhere All at Once” or for Anderson’s previous best weekend performer, “The Grand Budapest Hotel.” This level of performance doesn’t suggest it will reach those levels, but $30 million domestic (too early to suggest that) would be a huge achievement. “The Whale” and “The Fabelmans,” the two best late 2022 awards contenders, did under $20 million.It’s significant that “Asteroid” and “Past Lives” include many non-top chain theaters in their breaks; even more so that they are among the best-grossing screens for both films. In its fourth weekend, “Lives” grossed over $1.1 million in 297 theaters. It slow rollout is critical as it takes root among wider audiences. This is a very encouraging performance.1.

        "title": "Jon Hamm Left ‘Megalopolis’ Table Read Thinking ‘I Don’t Know How He’s Gonna Make This Movie’",
        "content": "Francis Ford Coppola‘s lifelong commitment to taking creative risks and betting on himself is culminating with “Megalopolis,” his self-financed passion project that recently wrapped production. The epic romance, which takes place in a futuristic city called New Rome, was dogged by rumors of on-set dysfunction that Coppola and his A-list cast denied. But the film‘s staggering scale has impressed many cinephiles — including Jon Hamm.In a new appearance on the Back to One podcast to promote his role in “Maggie Moore(s),” Hamm praised Coppola for taking such an ambitious swing.“Look at what Francis Ford Coppola is doing right now,” Hamm said. “He’s making a $300 million movie that he just has wanted to make. I did a table read of it, I know how impossible this movie is to make. But he’s making it. And God bless him, that’s exactly what he should be doing.”Hamm explained that he received an inside look at Coppola’s creative process when he was invited to participate in a table read of “Megalopolis.” While Hamm is not starring in the film, he joined a coterie of actors to help Coppola work through the script — and walked away shocked by the scope of the project.“I was like, ‘I don’t know how he’s gonna make this movie,’” he said. “I sat at a table with Al Pacino, Shia LaBeouf, all these amazing actors. I thought ‘I don’t know know what this is gonna be, but I’m unbelievably happy to be here in this room on the Paramount lot where 45 years ago he made ‘The Godfather’ when Robert Evans was walking around. Like ‘okay, I’ll be part of this.’”Hamm’s comments echo similar remarks from “Megalopolis” star Adam Driver, who recently praised Coppola’s creativity and willingness to take on such an ambitious project.“‘Megalopolis’ is one of the most exciting things that I’ve ever been a part of, with Francis in particular,” Driver said. “It’s one of the best shooting experiences I’ve had. And the things that he’s made, there’s no frame of reference for it. It’s so unique and inventive and hopefully accessible by everyone. That it’s not so elusive that it’s for a certain audience, it’s for everyone. And he is everything that you hope he will be.”",

        "title": "‘Joker: Folie à Deux’ Cinematographer Says Sequel Was Influenced by Coppola’s Flop Musical",
        "content": "One of the biggest question marks on the 2024 film calendar is “Joker: Folie à Deux.” For the sequel to his Oscar-winning DC villain origin story, Todd Phillips blew up his narrative formula by deciding to make a musical. Lady Gaga joined the franchise as Harley Quinn, but little is known about how Phillips plans to infuse music into his version of Gotham. Film history is not exactly littered with superhero musicals, so it can be difficult for outside observers to gauge what his points of reference might be.However, cinematographer Lawrence Sher might have given fans one of their first big hints about the film’s influences. Sher, who shot both “Joker” and “Folie à Deux,” recently revealed that he used an infamous Francis Ford Coppola musical as a point of reference. In an interview with YouTuber Matti Haapoja, Sher listed Coppola’s 1981 film “One from the Heart” as one of the film’s visual inspirations.“’One from the Heart,’ which is an old Francis Ford Coppola movie,” Sher said when asked about films that he has recently studied. “I broke that down for the new ‘Joker’ so that it was part of the conversation. Whether those images ended up really influencing the new one, in part maybe they did, they became a conversation starter for me and Mark Friedberg the production designer and Todd as we scouted in those early days. Even if it’s not a reference that you’re going to take on set and say ‘I want it to look like that,’ it’s like brain food. It’s dream food.” “One From the Heart” follows a young couple played by Frederic Forrest and Teri Garr who reconsider their breakup after spending a chaotic night in Las Vegas with two new lovers. The film was a critical and commercial flop, grossing less than $1 million on a $26 million budget. But the film has enjoyed a slight reappraisal in recent years with cinephiles praising the virtuosic cinematography and artful depictions of Las Vegas (even if the narrative aspects are still generally panned).“Joker: Folie à Deux” opens in theaters on October 4, 2024.",

        "content": "Brandon Cronenberg‘s “Infinity Pool” shocked Sundance audiences with its neon-tinged story of psychological torture at a hedonistic resort. But even with all of the murdered clones and dog collars, the version that audiences saw was considerably tamer than what Cronenberg originally shot.When his NC-17 director’s cut was released in March, fans were shocked to see a much more explicit version of a sex scene between Gabi (Mia Love) and James (Alexander Skarsgård) that featured full frontal nudity from Skarsgård. At a Q&A moderated by IndieWire’s Eric Kohn following a screening of the directors cut, Cronenberg opened up about the provocative new scene and why it had to be cut.“The MPAA has only one objective rule, and that’s no hard cocks,” Cronenberg said. “Everything else is a mind-fuckingly weird, infuriating, subjective quagmire that you have to navigate with them, no offense to the MPAA. But no hard cocks, we knew was the thing, so that had to to come out.”Cronenberg said that his special effects artist Dan Martin is a skilled prosthetic constructor and worked well with Skarsgard to design his fake genitalia.“He makes a lot of penises. The kind of movies that he does, he ends up making penises very, very, very frequently,” he said. “There’s a very interesting process where you introduce Dan to your actor and say ‘Dan is sculpting your penis. So he can send you shots of this penis and you can approve it. Alex Skarsgard had already done that on something else, so he’s like ‘oh yeah, we’ve done this a million times, send me the dick picks.”Despite the easy sculpting process, the prosthetic had some functionality problems when they shot the sex scene in Croatia. Cronenberg said that technical difficulties involving the ejaculation process forced him to get creative and reshoot the scene.“We shot it the first time in Croatia and the semen jammed. It really just sort of dribbled out and was too consistently white,” he said. “So the shot that’s in the film was shot in a studio after the main shoot.”Additional reporting by Eric Kohn.",

        "title": "Even the ‘Past Lives’ Actors Didn’t Know When Skype Would Freeze During the Breakup Scene",
        "content": "Writer and director Celine Song presents a question at the very beginning of “Past Lives”: Who are these people sitting together at a cozy Lower East Side bar? But the answer is as much about place as it is about Hae Sung (Tao Yoo) and Nora (Greta Lee). The A24 film shows their relationship in three very different places and times — as children in Seoul, as young adults reconnecting over the internet from different continents, and then meeting again in New York City years later — and while they’re always wonderful foils and complements for each other, at each point, something isn’t quite right. In the middle section of the film, where Hae Sung and Nora reconnect 12 years after Nora’s family immigrated to Canada, what makes their relationship feel both special and burdensome is the time difference. It was important to Song that the audience experience the warmth of the odd little Skype bubble that Hae Sung and Nora create, but also the disconnecting forces pulling at them. It eventually leads Nora to stop talking to Hae Sung so she can jump fully into her life as an emerging writer in New York City. “I kept talking about the Skype sequence like in a romantic comedy where the main characters are trying on different outfits until they find the perfect dress,” Song told IndieWire. “That was one of the big musical moments that we were trying to get right because you want it to feel like you’re not giving away the ending there, but you have to progress an entire relationship online.” Song, cinematographer Shabier Kirchner, and production designer Grace Yun all collaborated on a heartbreaking transition during the “breakup” sequence, where Nora starts in darkness and hangs up at dawn, while Hae Sung’s room remains cool and dusky and ends in darkness. There’s an emotionality to the lighting pattern that dramatizes the gulf of an unbridgeable time difference.Hae Sung’s and Nora’s rooms were built as two different sets on the same stage, with lighting timed by Kirchner and gaffer Andrew Hubbard to simulate separate sunrises and sunsets. “We wanted it to be this thing where the magic of time zones is that it allows for that kind of contradiction and impossibility,” Song said. “At the end of the conversation, we see Hae Sung in darkness on Skype. So even though we as the audience have seen the face he’s making in the darkness, Nora hasn’t seen it. Nora doesn’t see that he looked devastated.” For all that the breakup sequence is about deliberate and accidental missed emotional connections, Song added another layer to the disconnect between them. “We actually had the two rooms connected by a wire for the [Skype] connection, and then we put a throttle on it, so we were controlling how shitty the connection was and when it would freeze,” Song said. “I could cue when the freezing of Hae Sung’s space was going to happen, and the actors didn’t know when that was going to be so they had to react.” While editing, music, and performance carry the fun of this emotional long-distance relationship, the film’s lighting and sonic contrasts ultimately dispel it. “When they’re breaking up, when Nora takes off her headphones, it was really important that the sound of the city would just come rushing in,” Song said. “We start to hear the sound of the city a little bit louder and louder and louder because we’re really trying to locate the characters to be deeper and deeper and deeper in the place that they are actually in.” ",

        "title": "Turner Classic Movies Needs a New Home, Not Just New Leadership",
        "content": "Kohn’s Corner is a weekly column about the challenges and opportunities of sustaining American film culture.Shame was never high on Warner Media Discovery CEO David Zaslav‘s priority list: Over the past 12 months, he buried “Batgirl,” yanked close to 100 titles from its streaming service, and threw a lavish party at Cannes in the middle of the WGA strike. Yet in January, when I devoted this column to questions about the prospects for Turner Classic Movies at WBD, the company did its best to project a bright future. Zaslav loved TCM, the company’s general manager Pola Changnon told me. “We feel fortunate that in this new world, at the top, someone cares about us,” Changnon said. That affection has its limits. After a handful of layoffs earlier this year, TCM lost its five senior executives this week, including Changnon and VP of programing and strategy Charles “Charlie” Tabesh, a 25-year veteran known as the network’s curation mastermind. More staffers were laid off later in the week; the TCM UK channel also closed. There has been discussion, now tabled, of eliminating post-film discussion segments. Per usual in today’s rapid-fire media landscape, nothing stays settled for long. After an outcry led by no less than Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, and Paul Thomas Anderson, TCM continues to be overseen by former Discovery+ executive Kathleen Finch, but at least some aspect of its fate now rests with Warner Bros. executives Mike De Luca and Pamela Abdy, the former MGM heads adored by filmmakers who see them as likeminded peers, rather than bean-counting executives. So… happy ending?Not so fast. The De Luca/Abdy pivot is a short-term solution to a PR crisis, but it remains to be seen how much impact the pair will have. For now, reports suggest they have only been brought onboard to advise on TCM editorial and curation. What that means has yet to be defined. Another senior managerial role will oversee TCM as a whole, but that role remains TBD.However, even if De Luca and Abdy secure greater managerial oversight, it’s hard to see how they might restructure a brand that has already been dismantled from the top. The treasured TCM Classic Film Festival has been reduced to a staff of two, Mark Wynns and Lindsay Griffin, while Tabesh’s programming team is comprised of three people: senior director Stephanie Thames, senior director Scott McGee, and coordinator Ben Cheeves. Sources tell me that while Changnon will not rejoin the company after the latest developments with De Luca and Abdy, Tabesh is still in the mix and may find a way back after this week’s events, if he’s guaranteed the kind of programming autonomy that enabled him to maintain the substance of TCM.For now, the preeminent brand for classic film in America — only Criterion comes close to forging such reverence for the history of the medium across generations — has been reduced to a scrappy team tasked with serving an ambiguous agenda. Zaslav can love classic film all he wants, but a real hero would acknowledge the obvious: TCM needs a new home, not a tenuous slot inside a place with no tangible investment in its future. If that home is indeed within Warner Bros. Discovery, then its structure within the company must be reinvented to ensure its long-term sustainability.That’s where the main problem continues to fester. WBD’s network marketing is now consolidated to a so-called “center of excellence” that oversees all its brands within the U.S. Networks Group. However, since TCM doesn’t run ads, it sits near the bottom of the list for that team. Even if it incorporates advertisement into its offerings, the core passionate audience would be comparatively smaller than the ones for other channels. Whoever leads TCM will have to carve a path out of this centralized structure so that the channel isn’t constantly pitted unfairly against the other brands.The executives running TCM will also have to respect its curatorial agenda rather than pushing it toward the corporate mandates of the moment. After all, the decision to fire TCM’s top leadership made little sense in the first place: The brand’s value largely stems from the people who program for its devout audience. Ted Turner’s movie library gave birth to the brand decades ago, but much of what TCM airs is licensed from other sources. Its curatorial spice comes from a blend of comforting familiarity and ventures into the unknown: For every “Casablanca” or “Citizen Kane,” you’ll find a rare silent comedy or an underappreciated B-movie to prove that film history is a constant journey. The brand value lies in people with institutional knowledge and cinephile curiosity who give TCM the authority and authenticity that makes it into a “reputational asset” for the company.By studio metrics, that’s a modest investment: I’m told the annual budget averages out to less than $45 million to cover everything from licensing fees to the festival and the salaries of the team. That’s a fraction of the production and marketing budget for “The Flash,” only this product delivers on the hype. As my colleague Christian Blauvelt reported earlier, Spielberg, Scorsese, and Anderson hopped on the phone with Zaslav to express their concerns, and it seems they had a genuine impact. But this the “Avengers” assemblage of America’s most treasured auteurs might not have changed Zaslav’s strategy if he didn’t have pending business with at least one of them.I’m told that Anderson’s mysterious next movie, rumored to star Joaquin Phoenix, Viggo Mortensen, and Regina Hall, has been set up at Warner Bros. Zaslav probably wants to keep that emerging deal in place, lest he repeat the mistakes of former WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar, who alienated Christopher Nolan with the 2021 day-and-date release strategy as the director fled his longtime studio home and set up “Oppenheimer” at Universal instead. Zaslav is hacking at divisions across the company, so salvaging a PTA deal may not be his highest priority. The statement issued by the directors on Tuesday said Zaslav reached out to the men earlier this week, though multiple sources tell IndieWire that’s not true at all — Scorsese instigated the call through his non-profit The Film Foundation, a company that has been experimenting with streaming classic films through its website over the past year and might make more sense as a future home for TCM than any line item in Zaslav’s budget. So why did Zaslav get credit for the call? The statement attempts to let him calm the waters without having to officially issue any remarks himself. He outsourced a shield to the film community.Let’s assume that De Luca and Abdy can stabilize some of the panic about TCM’s immediate. It will never find total security within the cold-hearted WBD ecosystem, so the same influential people who scrambled to save it this week might consider a contingency plan if anything like this happens again. One day, in a foreseeable future TBD, TCM could benefit from a new owner. But what would TCM even look like under new ownership? And how could it be set up to succeed?In conversations with past and present staffers, it’s clear that TCM is not an obvious fit within the evolving streaming marketplace. The company’s newly rebranded streaming platform Max has a budget cap on the number of classic film titles it can post to the service at a time, and that narrow curation doesn’t address TCM’s core appeal as “a precious resource of cinema, open 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” as Anderson, Scorsese, and Spielberg put it in their statement. Its live-TV presence distinguishes TCM from the likes of the Criterion Channel, which has attempted to carve a path toward sustainability by entering the niche streaming market. On-demand streaming is not what TCM does best. Turn on the channel and the movies are always there for you. However, there could be a future for this kind of never-ending curatorial approach that splits the difference between streaming and cable — one that could exist beyond the constraints of WBD if key stakeholders engage in some outside-the-box thinking and pony up.While broadcast and cable seem less viable in today’s on-demand marketplace, the “always on” conceit remains contemporary among GenZers who get so much of their media diet from live streams on YouTube, Twitch, and elsewhere. These entities are also themselves OTT streaming services that can be experienced as live TV. A passionate investor could set up the TCM concept as a 24/7 channel within this ecosystem, continue to please the legacy audience and Hollywood royalty that treasures its existence, while ingesting new audiences in the process. The programming itself is a relatively inexpensive undertaking — it just needs the proper framework to thrive. And hey, maybe De Luca and Abdy or the new TCM overseer to come might consider some version of this approach by making a live feed of TCM available to all Max subscribers. If they really wanted to solve the TCM problem, they would do it by fighting to ensure it has a prominent role in the company’s most visible line of business. More people might even tune in as a result.For now, Zaslav has engaged in performative valiance by establishing a loose protective sphere around TCM rather than bidding it adieu in style. It’s impossible to make the case for a safe space at an organization so prone to abrupt cutbacks and reorganizations. Reality check: The call is coming from inside the house. In any case, I’ve heard that outgoing TCM leader Changnon will remain at the channel until the end of August, just in time for the Telluride Film Festival, where TCM has maintained a robust presence alongside many of the festival’s classic film restorations for years. Whatever happens next, the community marches on.As usual, I encourage readers to reach out with their thoughts on this week’s column: eric@indiewire.comLast week, I looked at the implications of the French New Wave’s key directors dying off. Here’s one response I received among several. “Jacques Rozier may not have been the last New Wave filmmaker – Alain Cavalier is still alive and apparently still active. Only his ‘Thérese’ (1986) ever had much success in the US, though a handful of his earliest, more traditional films featuring players like Deneuve, Piccoli and Trintignant had some US exposure.  But his work for the past 35 or so year has been as off American radar as it is provocative, worthwhile and intriguing.” —Peter Scarlet, film programmer",

        "title": "Pete Davidson’s Improv Inspired the Look of His ‘Transformers: Rise of the Beasts’ Character",
        "content": "For the first-time team-up between the Autobots and Maximals in the “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” prequel, director Steven Caple Jr. (“Creed II”) was given a lot of creative freedom in designing and animating the characters. Gone was ILM from the previous six films, giving way to MPC and Wētā FX. MPC was the principal VFX studio and did all of the design work, but both had a hand in overhauling the Autobots and introducing the beast-like Maximals, which mix fur and flesh with their metal parts.Production VFX supervisor Gary Brozenich (from MPC) oversaw the work. After studying the previous films, he met with Caple to discuss his vision for tailoring the animation and also consulted with previous director Michael Bay (who still serves as producer). Rather than continuing to push the hyper-realism of the Bay films, Caple wanted to make them look more straightforward, with a nod toward the G1 design of the original toys and animated TV series from the ’80s.“That wasn’t the kind of movie that Steven wanted,” Brozenich told IndieWire. “But what I came away with from talking to Bay about it was the power of being able to find the equivalent of what you would do with a bounce card on set or reflector card next to an actor. We played with that throughout the film with these walking, talking, metallic, reflective characters, straddling the line between [photo-realism and hyper-realism].The first objective for Caple was to give the powerful Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) a character arc as part of his origin story predating the 2007 film. This eases the world-weary warrior into joining the Maximals (led by gorilla Optimus Primal, voiced by Ron Perlman) in protecting Earth from the planet-eating Unicron (voiced by Colman Domingo) and henchman Scourge (voiced by Peter Dinklage).“We wanted to give [Prime] a lot more human-like depth and for us to go on that journey with him to get to a very dark place where he’s down,” Brozenich said. “And he needs to find the beauty of humankind again, to be able to wanna save them.”As a result, the director encouraged MPC to modify the design of Prime, returning to his original, boxier look. They also patterned his face after voice actor Cullen’s and added more emotion during dialogue scenes. Another important character was the newest sidekick, Mirage (voiced by Pete Davidson), the Autobot spy who projects holograms and transforms into a silver-blue Porsche 964 Carrera RS 3.8. “When Steven and I first met, the first character we talked about was Mirage, and this is way before Pete Davidson entered the frame,” added Brozenich. “But his take on him was streetwise like Tyler Durden from ‘Fight Club.’ He loved the fluidity of Brad Pitt’s character in that film and the sort of schizophrenic nature of him where he would turn on a dime.”But with Davidson providing a lot of funny improv, this allowed the animators to tailor the animation around his vibe. The sporty look of the curvy Porsche also played a role in shaping the performance. “He was really sympathetic to camera, in a way that a lot of the other characters weren’t because they were so boxy in design,” said Brozenich.One of the most significant developments was how MPC re-imagined the critical transformations from vehicles to robots with their own new proprietary tool. This allowed the animators to splice, separate, and re-arrange geometry on a model, in any given shot, and on any asset.“For instance, if you took the car door at any point, I could tell them that this doesn’t look complex enough,” Brozenich continued. “Typically, there’s a tendency to have things go into more of a 90-degree perpendicular angle to each other. But when you start introducing non-linear angles and rotations, that’s when you start to feel the complexity of the object changing.”Wētā, meanwhile, was recruited late in production to handle the opening introduction of the Maximal planet and the high-octane climactic battle inside a volcanic crater. They utilized their suite of proprietary tools to apply facial performance capture to rigid surface robotic models. In addition, they created their own tool for dealing with transformations, including one-offs for the Maximals as they prepared for battle. This was more involved with animals changing into robots. Since Wētā’s sequences were theirs alone, the handoff of MPC’s design work was pretty straightforward.“Obviously everybody has their own proprietary rendering and shader technology, so we had to do that side of the thing and made their designs work within the language of our pipeline,” VFX supervisor Matt Aitken of Wētā told IndieWire.Even though the beast-like Maximals are very much in Wētā’s wheelhouse (they leaned into their “Planet of the Apes” experience), the mechanical DNA of the Transformers was a new challenge for their rigging team. “That giant robot has to move in a way that supports their scale and the animation is really important,” Aitken continued. “We are used to applying detail to our creature work, making it authentic to help sell the realism. And detail is important with the Transformers in a different way, with the mechanical detailing and lots of moving parts, getting all that sense of detail working.”There was also the opportunity to get more nuanced facial performance (with the aid of mo-capped doubles for reference) than on previous “Transformer” films. But it was on a very compressed schedule. “We wanted to provide our facial animators with an interface that they could immediately adapt to,” said Aitken. “So we made a decision at the start to leverage off the experiences that our facial animators have and combine them with a facial rig that they’re used to. So within each of our Transformers, we have a human face that’s been modified to match the shape of the robot.”In terms of Wētā’s transformations, they had their own variation of the slice and dice method but pushed the task until the end when they could devote more attention to it. “As they’re crafting the transformation, they’re cutting it up into bite-sized chunks,” Aitken added. “But we needed to get the articulation that they require: splitting, edge beveling, and edge extrusions that happen dynamically during the transformation process.”",

        "title": "‘Cool World’ Is the Slimy, Adult Answer to ‘Who Framed Roger Rabbit?’ Best Watched After Midnight",
        "content": "On Friday nights, IndieWire After Dark takes a feature-length beat to honor fringe cinema in the streaming age.First, the spoiler-free pitch for one editor’s midnight movie pick — something weird and wonderful from any age of film that deserves our memorializing.Then, the spoiler-filled aftermath as experienced by the unwitting editor attacked by this week’s recommendation.Embraced by lovers of animated baddies and so-wrong-it’s-right gems everywhere, this dark (and, like, sticky?) medium-blending fantasy film was intended to be Bakshi’s big comeback after a ten-year movie hiatus, arriving aboard a hype train from Warner Bros. and Disney’s half-animated film noir spoof from 1988.Working with the biggest budget of that decade, “Roger Rabbit” — starring Bob Hoskins opposite a fast-talking animated bunny, voiced by Charles Fleischer — won three Oscars and pulled the highest box office of its year. The cartoon crossover event allowed Looney Toons’ Bugs and Daffy to miraculously share a screen with Disney’s Mickey and Donald to uproarious success. Plus, it introduced bonafide sex symbol Jessica Rabbit to the drooling masses via a sincere story with some real technical chops.So, naturally, for its slimy, ill-advised knockoff, Paramount risked no original IP and left its talented director to languish in an inky puddle of studio interference and missed opportunities. Bakshi, a visionary animator and director, was best known then for the masterful “American Pop” (1981), and the stunning hand-drawn “Lord of the Rings” (1978). A 75-foot billboard cutout of “Cool World” breakout star Holli Would — a gogo dancing villainess, voiced by a bimbo-fied Kim Basinger — heralded Bakshi’s return, and was erected above the “H” in the Hollywood sign that summer in Los Angeles. Really.His last film in the end, Bakshi’s inverted, perverted take on Toontown went through countless rewrites and far too tumultuous of a production process to produce anything cohesive. “Poltergeist” co-writers Michael Grais and Mark Victor ultimately get the writing credit on an icky, misguided story you can safely pick for parts but exemplifies the sometimes mesmerizing lows that can come from artistic disasters.Fresh off his breakout in “Thelma & Louise,” Brad Pitt stars as a World War II veteran and victim of a hit-and-run inexplicably sucked into an animated world. He quickly learns that in Cool World, humans or “Noids” (gag) are prohibited from fornicating with the cartoon beings known as Doodles — or something bad that never really gets explained might happen. Enter Holli, who really wants to fuck a human dude because that just might make her human? Maybe? Enter Gabriel Byrne, looking horny and confused as ever, as Jack Deebs: the tortured comic book artist who created the in-universe “Cool World,” and might just give Holli what she wants. Therein lies the rub… or not. —AF“Alright, Brad, all you have to do is stand there and hold your arm at a 120 degree angle as if there’s a watermelon floating next to your ear that you’re trying to squeeze with your elbow. We’ll go in afterwards and add the three sickly women giving handjobs to spherical purple demons while dodging urine streams from anthropomorphic sewer rats.” —Ralph Bakshi every day on set, I imagine.This was the first time I’ve ever walked away from a film with the unshakeable feeling that I caught an STD from watching it. I could tell that the skeleton of a conventional Hollywood movie was lurking somewhere underneath “Cool World,” but all I could see was the blubbery mass of what can only be described as animated chlamydia that was draped over it. Not sure if this is a testament to the film or an indictment of my personal character, but I enjoyed every second of it.I do, however, have some concerns about the legal system and allocation of police resources in Cool World. It appears that Brad Pitt has a taxpayer-funded job as… The Anti-Fucking Police? His only responsibility for the past 47 years has been preventing Noids from having sex with Toons, despite the fact that up until very recently he was the only Noid? In a world that’s literally riddled with trash fires and rabid dogs and peeping toms, I think it’s an inexcusable mistake to have him devote his entire law enforcement career to policing his own celibacy. Really makes you wonder how many other tragedies in this film could have been prevented by a competent city government.To me, this movie embodies the “halfway decent idea executed unimaginably poorly” subgenre that I love so dearly. It’s easy to imagine a “Fritz the Cat”-loving cinephile being elated by the news that Ralph Bakshi was going to apply his brand of animated sleaze to a live-action canvas after the success of “Who Framed Roger Rabbit?” And the idea of an adult-oriented riff on Zemeckis’ formula doesn’t sound theoretically terrible either. Watching it fail to live up to that promise is utterly fascinating. For all the talk of sex, “Cool World” is profoundly — almost disgustingly — unsexy. I think it goes off the rails in part because there’s some seriously repressed puritanism lurking beneath the surface. The film truly seems to believe that sex isn’t a positive experience that people are meant to share — it’s something that you stand on a cartoon dog’s shoulders to watch other people do through the window while you jerk off. Bakshi keeps reminding us that we should feel guilty about the filth we’re watching, and eventually I started to believe him. —CZThose brave enough to join in on the fun can rent “Cool World” on Prime Video, Apple TV, YouTube, and Google Play.",

        "title": "Welcome to IndieWire After Dark: Weekly Midnight Movies Presented for the Streaming Age",
        "content": "(Hey, you! Yeah, you! Looking for the complete IndieWire After Dark Collection? Click here, homie!)If a “midnight movie” is streamed on a laptop at two o’clock in the afternoon — and no one is there to obsess about it with you — is it even a midnight movie? Some films automatically qualify as midnight movies thanks to subject matter or conceptual guts; Divine didn’t eat dog shit for you to disrespect “Pink Flamingos” (1972). Others get their genre credentials grandfathered in by decades of fans screening them; cheesy or not, “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” (1975) always counts.But past counter-cultural phenomena can’t guide the future of the genre and weirdo film culture forever. A tradition rooted in transgression, left to wander down a sad path of static nostalgia and “The Big Lebowski” (1998) quotes, isn’t transgressive at all. And it’s not as if there’s a shortage of in-your-face cinema being produced. We’re living in a world where Agathe Rouselle fucked a Cadillac in “Titane” (2021), and a certain cartoon bear used Eeyore’s severed tail as a flogger in “Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey” (2023). And yet, the 21st century’s embarrassment of ridiculous riches somehow seems to undercut the midnight movie moniker. With countless taboo, transgressive, and low-budget indies streaming 24/7 (for all we know, “Midnight Movies” might already be the name of a niche streaming service), the real-world subculture that revolves around last century’s midnight movies feels oversaturated and muted at the same time.On the one hand, identifying and canonizing new midnight movies should be easy; we’ve got more than enough films to watch and countless artists screaming to say something. On the other hand, the days of sneaking out to the theater in search of provocative images you can’t find anywhere else are effectively over. Anyone with wifi and ten seconds to kill can find myriad opportunities to shock themselves in unspeakable ways. Hell, “Hostel” (2005) used to be on Hulu.But with theaters on superhero life support — and the internet as cold and vast an expanse as ever — where to begin turning titles you can theoretically stream anytime into communal experiences best enjoyed by hardcore cinephiles in the dark?In the festival world, “midnight movies” have taken on a broader definition as a category encompassing shit that’s too weird to program alongside more mainstream fare. Major players like TIFF and Sundance have Midnight sections showcasing the most shocking, genre-bending works from rising indie filmmakers. For a certain breed of independent artist, making the Midnight lineup at one of these festivals is a goal in and of itself. There’s a delightful irony to the idea of bestowing institutional legitimacy on films that do everything in their power to defy common decency, but we’re not complaining because it’s cool as hell. Still, outsourcing an entire counterculture to a handful of institutions is a fool’s errand. Festivals have a vital role to play in the midnight movie ecosystem, but their understandable focus on new releases means that they will always be an incomplete solution. A thriving midnight movie culture is a constant dialogue between the ahead-of-its-time past and the boundary-pushing present. The first century of film history is littered with hidden gems that are begging to be discovered — and in some cases, reappraised with modern cultural context that their creators would have never imagined was possible.  As of now, the internet is an embarrassment of riches for cinephiles looking to explore once-forgotten films. But harrowing dispatches from the battlefields of the Streaming Wars are a constant reminder that it could all disappear at any moment. The bleak reality is that the shocking film that you’re obsessing over could be unceremoniously pulled from every streaming library tomorrow without so much as an explanation. It’s time to appreciate what we have while we have it and build a new canon of midnight movies that’s worthy of continued preservation. With over a century’s worth of media at our fingertips at any given moment (*nervously knocks on wood while refreshing the Max library*), it often feels as if the modern cinephile’s predicament has gone from dying of thirst in the desert to doing so in the middle of the ocean. But rather than rendering midnight movies an anachronistic tradition, we believe that cultural saturation only makes them more essential. We need daring and depraved cinema to cut through the noise and remind us all that yes, there is still something out there that we truly haven’t seen before. In our new column, IndieWire After Dark, we’ll take a feature-length beat each week to highlight weird, wonderful, way-too-much cinema and honor the changing experience of communal viewing. Each edition will anoint a new midnight movie that one of us thinks is always worth remembering — and the other is experiencing for the first time. We’ll highlight new filmmakers whose brilliantly fucked-up visions demand larger audiences while celebrating old ones whose work is just too weird to be forgotten. A wide range of genres are welcome here, but each IndieWire After Dark selection is a film that threw caution to the wind and unapologetically swung for the fences. Some achieved their lofty goals and others failed in ways that created unintentional brilliance, but they all reinforce the idea that creative independence thrives after the clock strikes midnight. IndieWire After Dark publishes midnight movie recommendations at 11:59pm ET every Friday. Or, you know, at least until someone gets sucked into a wormhole or something.",

        "content": "The Directors Guild of America has formally ratified the new collective bargaining agreement that its leaders struck with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers on June 4. The deal, which passed with the support of 87% of DGA members, officially ensures that the guild will not join Hollywood’s writers in striking this summer.The three-year deal included a 76% increase in foreign streaming residuals for projects produced for the largest studios and streaming platforms. Other highlights included increased parental leave benefits and language stating that artificial intelligence is “not a person” and cannot replace directors on film and television projects.“I’m proud to report that DGA members have joined together to ratify a new contract that will allow every Director, Assistant Director, Unit Production Manager, Associate Director and Stage Manager to share in the success of what we create,” guild president Lesli Linka Glatter said in a statement. “Our new contract secures gains on wages, global streaming residuals, safety, diversity and creative rights that build for the future and impact every category of member in our Guild. The strength of our new contract is a testament to our Negotiations Committee Chair Jon Avnet, Negotiations Co-chairs Karen Gaviola and Todd Holland, National Executive Director Russell Hollander and our outstanding professional staff.”While some industry observers initially viewed the deal as a blow to solidarity with the striking writers — and the actors who may soon join them if SAG-AFTRA is unable to reach its own agreement — Glatter made it clear that the DGA still stands with fellow creatives on strike.“I also want to acknowledge that the DGA didn’t bargain in a vacuum. We stand united with writers, actors and all crew members in our shared fight to move our industry forward,” she said.  “We support the actors who are in negotiations and the writers who remain on strike, and we will stand with the IA and Teamsters when they negotiate their agreement next year. We won’t be satisfied until we all have fair contracts that reward us for our creative work — we must create a vibrant, sustainable industry that fairly values us all.”",

        "title": "Turner Classic Movies Has New Leaders in Warner Bros. Pictures Heads Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy",
        "content": "A day after a series of high-profile layoffs at Turner Classic Movies sparked outrage among the film community, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav has installed new leadership at the beloved cable network.IndieWire has confirmed that Warner Bros. Film Group co-CEOs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy will add oversight of TCM to their portfolio of responsibilities. De Luca and Adby are expected to oversee programming at TCM, taking over for longtime general manager Pola Changnon programming head Charles Tabesh, who were both laid off on Wednesday.In addition to Changnon and Tabesh, the layoffs included VP of brand creative and marketing Dexter Fedor; VP of enterprises and strategic partnerships Genevieve McGillicuddy, who also served as the director of the annual TCM Film Festival; and VP of studio production Anne Wilson. Among their responsibilities were curating lineups, shooting intros and outros, and creating original shows, documentaries, and video essays.While Zaslav had publicly expressed his support for TCM on multiple occasions, many feared that the company’s cost-cutting measures and focus on tentpole franchises would inevitably lead to the niche cable network being neglected. Many prominent voices were quick to defend the channel’s role in the larger film ecosystem after the news of layoffs broke.“If TCM is neglected, or God forbid, shuttered, it would be a massive loss to cinema culture,” IndieWire’s Christian Blauvelt wrote. “It would devalue Warner Bros.’ own legacy — if they don’t care about this unique way of putting their history on display and in context, why should filmmakers believe that Warner Bros. values cinema beyond the bottom line?”Shortly after the TCM layoffs were announced, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, and Paul Thomas Anderson met with Zaslav to discuss the network’s future. Afterwards, they released a statement expressing their continued support for TCM and optimism about its future.“We have each spent time talking to David, separately and together, and it’s clear that TCM and classic cinema are very important to him.  Our primary aim is to ensure that TCM’s programming is untouched and protected,” the three directors said in a statement. “We are heartened and encouraged by the conversations we’ve had thus far, and we are committed to working together to ensure the continuation of this cultural touchstone that we all treasure.”",

        "title": "Henry Cavill Lost Out on James Bond Because He Looked ‘Too Young’",
        "content": "Henry Cavill‘s age worked against him when auditioning to play James Bond.The “Man of Steel” actor was the second choice to portray 007 in the 2006 franchise revamp “Casino Royale,” with director Martin Campbell now revealing that Cavill would have been cast if he appeared older — and if Daniel Craig wasn’t available.“He looked great in the audition. His acting was tremendous,” Campbell said in an interview with Express UK. “And look, if Daniel didn’t exist Henry would have made an excellent Bond. He looked terrific, he was in great physical shape… very handsome, very chiseled. He just looked a little young at that time back then.”Sam Heughan and Matthew Rhys were also in the running to take on the role that eventually went to Craig, who led the Bond film series until 2021’s “No Time to Die.”Longtime franchise casting director Debbie McWilliams, who has worked on the films since 1981, recently revealed that the next Bond actor will need to possess a mature “gravitas” to take on the part.“When we started, it was a slightly different feel,” McWilliams said earlier this year. “We did look at a lot of younger actors, and I just don’t think they had the gravitas. They didn’t have the experience, they didn’t have the mental capacity to take it on, because it’s not just the part they’re taking on, it’s a massive responsibility.”McWilliams added, “So we kind of scrubbed that idea and went back to the drawing board and started again.”While age is a key factor being considered in the casting process, international recognition is not. McWilliams said that the next Bond doesn’t necessarily have to be world famous, recalling that Craig was a relatively unknown actor before “Casino Royale.”“A certain audience had heard of Daniel Craig, but much more the kind of independent cinema audience,” she said. “He hadn’t done any huge commercial film at all, really — ‘Layer Cake’ I suppose was the most popular, should we say, of the things he had done prior to Bond, but he wasn’t a hugely well-known actor.”Producer Michael G. Wilson recently echoed McWilliams’ sentiments about casting an older actor, noting that the new Bond “isn’t some kid out of high school that you can bring in and start off” and instead is a “veteran” of the British spy world.“That’s why it works for a 30-something,” Wilson said.",

        "title": "Here’s Why There Are 2 Versions of ‘Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse’ in Theaters",
        "content": "The number of webslingers in “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” can make your head spin, but did you know there are multiple versions of Sony smash hit “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” in theaters?Eagle-eyed (and owl-eared) moviegoers have begun catching on to the different cuts. Andy Leviton, the associate editor on the “Spider-Verse” films, questioned what took so long. On Twitter, Leviton wrote: “I was wondering when people might start noticing…”We didn’t all edit the movie, Andy!I was wondering when people might start noticing… https://t.co/E6G9tUXmDEWe’re noticing now though. Giddy fans and fan sites immediately began to compile the differences in sound (including dialogue) and animations between the two versions. But don’t call these Easter eggs; what started to become fairly obvious in our conversations with sources is that two different prints being screened was not the intended plan or desired outcome.Other differences according to viewers pic.twitter.com/ZAvNFbyGYYSo, ah, what’s up with that?Here’s what happened: Sony shipped out the international version of “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” early for translation purposes, a person close to production told IndieWire. That’s normal.What’s not normal is that several of the last-minute changes failed to make it from the Los Angeles editing lab into the film‘s screened international version. That could be from a failure to update an early for-translation-purposes-only print, or just good, old-fashioned running out of time to make a deadline. But which? That was one of our several questions to Sony, though we did not immediately hear back.While “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” opened June 2 to a whopping $120 million opening weekend, some moviegoers complained they could not hear the dialogue in the first scene. Sony rectified the issue with an updated version. At the time, writer/producer Phil Lord said it was an issue with theaters’ volume levels. “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” was mixed at Volume 7, Lord wrote on Twitter. Some theaters maybe didn’t get (or read) the memo.The memo:#SpiderVerse friends! if you get to the theater early and you want a fun mission ask someone to check that the theater volume is set at reference (7)! If it sounds a bit quiet, invite them to turn it up a touch to 7.5! If they give you flack… tell them we said it was okay. pic.twitter.com/BfgKuK9uM2“I heard several theaters this weekend at 7 and they sounded great,” Lord tweeted a week later. “All dialogue clear.”Another piece that’s currently unclear (we asked) is if Sony’s updated prints intended to rectify the volume issue reflected the update that ultimately divided the (old) international print with the (new) current domestic print. The multiverse is confusing.Also a bit murky: How many of the people pointing out the differences actually watched the film — intently — both in a United States theater and again in another country, all within the three weeks this “Spider-Verse” has been out? Unfortunately, piracy probably explains much of that.Among the questions we sent to Sony was if it is possible the non-updated international version is (or was) being screened in some spots in the U.S. We also reached out to Lord’s personal rep, but did not immediately hear back.Knowing how it generally works, here’s how it probably played out. A film’s distributor, in this case Sony, delivered a DCP (Digital Cinema Package) to a buying agent in each territory. That agent then delivered the package to individual theaters.By the way, don’t let the “digital” fool you here: Many DCPs are still delivered in a physical package. A DCP can also be delivered via satellite or terrestrial means, if the conditions (a theater’s physical location and its surroundings) are receptive. There are obvious advantages to satellite delivery, including speed. Here, another one that becomes obvious: A DCP delivered via satellite is far easier to update. Our source close to production told us it is unlikely that the international version will be replaced with the updated animations/sound.Physical delivery takes time, even domestically. Typically, DCPs would arrive at a theater the day before a movie previews. Internationally, not only must the physical DCPs cover more geographic ground (and air, and sea), they also have to clear customs. As anyone who has ever traveled with a passport will tell you, customs can take a while. “Spider-Verse” sacrifices were made.While this is all news to Film Twitter, don’t feel out of the loop — it’s also news to film-distribution executives. IndieWire checked in with three distribution execs for this story, and none were aware of the different “Across the Spider-Verse” versions. Each said it is exceedingly rare for a movie to be updated once engagement with audiences begins.Additional reporting by Bill Desowitz and Tom Brueggemann.",

        "title": "‘Revoir Paris’ Review: Virginie Efira Shines As a Shooting Survivor in Artful Drama",
        "content": "Cinema can be a powerful tool for tackling contemporary anxieties, but it’s rarely done as sensitively and artfully as in Alice Winocour’s poignant mass shooting drama “Revoir Paris.” While one could argue that certain terrors should never be recreated, Winocour proves that with a sensitive touch, even the most harrowing of tragedies can be alchemized into a stirring contemplation of societal ills. Filtering the intensity through one woman’s struggle to piece together her memories of a fateful night, “Revoir Paris” tells a sobering story of survival, trauma, and the power of human connection.Illuminated by a masterful performance by French actress Virginie Efira (“Benedetta,” “Other People’s Children”), “Revoir Paris” makes the unimaginable experience of surviving a violent attack beautifully real and painfully universal. The film never wallows in sentimentality or dwells in the violence (leave it to the French to be so matter-of-fact about a mass shooting), instead grounding the narrative in an investigation of memory that plays like a quiet thriller of the mind.The bulk of the film is told through the eyes of Mia (Efira), a radio translator whose marriage to doctor Vincent (Grégoire Colin) has gone a bit stale. Out to dinner one evening, Vincent gets a supposedly urgent call from the office, leaving Mia to finish her half-eaten meal alone. Riding her sleek Triumph motorcycle home, she stops into a lively bistro “just for a drink until the rain subsides.” Winocour shoots this scene with an ominous attention to detail, urging the viewer to sit up and take note of each visual cue. Close-ups of a woman’s bare shoulder walking down a hallway or a birthday cake glistening with sparklers will come back not to haunt Mia, but as vital touchstones for her memory.Sitting alone with her glass of wine, Mia observes two girlish Japanese tourists giggling over their escargot, and makes eye contact with the smoldering birthday guy as he gives her a very French once-over. When she returns from the bathroom, rapid gunshots send everyone careening to the floor, as her fellow diners perish before her eyes. Winocour frames the scene from Mia’s point of view, only showing the shooters in a flash of black boots and semi-automatic rifles. She crawls on the floor and plays dead before the screen goes black. Speaking to an unseen doctor, she says in voiceover: “What happened next is erased from my memory.”The rest of that night unfolds in bursts as Mia follows her curiosity to piece together what happened to her. Re-routed on her bus ride home, she passes by the fateful cafe and feels suddenly compelled to revisit. A brusque but helpful waiter clocks her as a survivor, and keys her into a group that meets at the restaurant during off hours to process. It’s there that she meets Thomas (Benoît Magimel), the man from the birthday table, who survived with a badly shattered leg. Having checked her out, he remembers her vividly, and helps dislodge some details that lead her down a path of discovery.Though it’s undoubtedly Mia’s story, the film takes on a choral quality as other characters narrate their own experiences of the night. We see the same events from slightly different angles just as Mia does, each voiceover revealing something new about the time she has blacked out. She is thrown into a tailspin of guilt and confusion when one woman accuses her of locking others out of the bathroom, and she is flooded with relief when her returning memory proves the woman wrong. More memories reveal more questions, and the third act of the film sends Mia searching for the undocumented kitchen worker who held her hand and told her they would make it.Though the events in “Revoir Paris” are fictional, Winocour was drawn to the subject after her brother survived the November 13 attacks at the Bataclan theater. She was in contact with him for part of the night while he was in hiding, and later spent time on online forums where survivors tried to find strangers who had kept them safe or offered a kind word. In her director’s statement, Winocour writes: “I experienced for myself how events are deconstructed, and often reconstructed, by memory.”One fellow survivor tells Mia about the diamond of trauma: The therapeutic idea that positive things can arise out of traumatic events, like friendships or love affairs, that would otherwise have never occurred. For Winocour, “Revoir Paris” is the creative fulfillment of that bittersweet promise. In making this film, she has gifted herself and others with a stirring portrayal of unimaginable terror, and a vital way to make sense of a senseless act.Music Box Films will release “Revoir Paris” in theaters on Friday, June 23.",

        "title": "‘Asteroid City’ Channeled ‘Bad Day at Black Rock’ for Its ’50s Desert Town — Down to the Tar Paper",
        "content": "If the eponymous mid-’50s southwestern town in Wes Anderson’s “Asteroid City” resembles the iconic “Bad Day at Black Rock” (1955), it’s no coincidence. Oscar-winning production designer Adam Stockhausen (“The Grand Budapest Hotel”) found John Sturges’ neo-Western, shot in CinemaScope on the edge of Death Valley, a valuable reference for planning the landscape for this Pirandello-like play-within-a-TV-show-within-a-movie conceit.“Absolutely, that was an influence,” Stockhausen (“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny”) told IndieWire. “We started right with the credits introduction with the moving train and then, of course, crossing with the little white sign. Generally, we were looking at ‘Black Rock’ for overall how the town’s [located] in the landscape. But also we’d go in and look at tiny details, too. How the tar paper was nailed to the roof of the gas station, and we ended up using it for the way we wrapped the tar paper around the motel cabins. Or the cafe when we took several little detailed pieces for the back counter of the luncheonette straight from there. We also looked at the rock formations when they drive out of town.“I think it really started with how to make this town right,” he continued. “And what it means to make a town that isn’t really a town, but, rather a set of a town. Where to make this town? Do we do it at a location? Do we do it in a real desert? Do we find an empty stretch of desert with a road running down the middle of it, and build the town, but take the landscape for granted? Or does that kind of give away the feeling of it being a set and make it in a way too real?”After scouting various locations in the U.S. and Europe, they decided to build the Astroid City town from scratch in the Spaghetti Western desert of Spain. They chose the empty, flattened farmland just beyond Chinchón, the sleepy town an hour from Madrid (where Orson Welles shot “Chimes at Midnight” and “The Immortal Story”).The main buildings consisted of the luncheonette, the motel cabins, and the single-pump gas station. The boulders and mountains were all built behind them. The location of the buildings was crucial. “How does the motel relate to the gas station?” Stockhausen said. “Is it a 180-degree turn, is it 90 degrees? So there’s all that mechanical stuff, and then there’s the diving right into the details of what exactly each of these things looks like, and starting the process of sifting through a million interesting little bits and pieces, like the tar paper.”With the town, Stockhausen and the art department created a handmade, cinematic version of the stage play, in keeping with Anderson’s colorful, symmetrical, diorama-like, analog style. It was shot by the director’s go-to cinematographer, Robert Yeoman, in widescreen 35mm with forced perspective to enhance the illusion. (Yeoman shot the live TV narration by Bryan Cranston and behind-the-scenes interplay in black-and-white and standard aspect ratio. These sets were built in the next town beyond Chinchón, in a former garlic warehouse.)Meanwhile, the pastel aesthetic was influenced by both the Eastman Color look of “Black Rock” and period photography. The filmmakers wanted red for the earth and rocks and the exterior of the buildings white, which highlighted the baking yellow, mid-day sun. This, again, was inspired by “Black Rock.” “Then everything else started to fall into place,” Stockhausen said. “The wallpaper and the tile and the floor in the luncheonette. But we were doing it within the context of already kind of having a baseline of what this world looks like.”To aid the forced perspective of this stage-like world-building, Stockhausen cheated just a little bit by lifting the horizon. “And then we have the road going back that ultimately tapers down,” he said. “And then the mountains surrounding was a big experiment to say what’s the magical point, at which our brains believe that this is full size, gigantic thing back there.”",

        "content": "Jennifer Lawrence has no hard feelings over offending audiences.The Oscar winner and “No Hard Feelings” actress-producer told Sky News that the hallmark of a great comedy film is making viewers uncomfortable.“I think it’s time for a good old-fashioned laugh,” Lawrence said, “and it really is hard to make a comedy where you’re not offending people. Everybody in some sense will be offended by this film — you’re welcome.”The “Silver Linings Playbook” actress continued, “Something we learned from the old-time comedies is mean comedy is not really funny, making somebody feel bad about themselves – other than me making fun of me. But the way that we did it is fine, we figured it out.”Lawrence’s “No Hard Feelings” co-star Andrew Barth Feldman echoed her sentiments about the Gene Stupnitsky-helmed film that follows a failed Uber driver (Lawrence) in her quest to get a new car…by having sex with a 19-year-old Princeton-bound teen (Feldman).“We need to be able to engage with being offended,” Feldman said. “There was and is like a big overcorrect because we realized there were so many things that we were joking about that we shouldn’t be. I think this movie does a really good job of continuing to push limits while still engaging with the conversation that the things that these people are doing are wrong and not a good idea.”The current debate over the state of comedy films in Hollywood also had Melissa McCarthy weigh in.“Somehow the new logline is that comedies don’t work,” the “Bridesmaids” star recently said. “I think bad comedies, I think bad movies don’t work but I will fight to my last breath, which will be in about 4 more wings, that comedies are important and I think it brings people together.”She continued, “I don’t know why, because we’ve never needed to laugh more. Comedy allows you to sit next to somebody whose ideas don’t match up. And maybe you come out a little closer.”",

        "content": "Sony Pictures Entertainment’s Motion Picture Group chairman and CEO Tom Rothman likes to make strong statements to project his confidence in the company in defense of the theatrical business. “We are not fucking around here,” he said at a CinemaCon presentation in April, in the process of unveiling footage from upcoming Sony releases like Ridley Scott’s “Napoleon” and “The Equalizer 3.” However, in a recent conversation for our Screen Talk podcast, Rothman did his best to clam up on the most pertinent topic facing the industry today: the WGA strike. The studio head told us at the start of the conversation that due to an agreement with the AMPTP, the entity negotiating with the writers guild on behalf of the studios, he was not allowed to discuss the current situation. Nevertheless, when it came to one of the more contentious subjects related to the strike, Rothman did say, “I believe AI is scary as shit. For a period of a time in my life, I was working on a movie with Steven Spielberg called ‘Robopocalypse.’ Trust me, bad shit can happen. You seriously think a computer can’t figure out the nuclear codes?” The WGA has been insisting that any AI materials assigned to a writer by a studio must give the writer original credit for the idea. While Rothman didn’t weigh in on that specific demand, he did imply that the studio wasn’t looking to supplant writers with AI. “A lot of the panic about this is overwrought,” he said. “I don’t believe that AI can replace creative genius.”As for the studio’s recent output, while the raunchy new Jennifer Lawrence romp “No Hard Feelings” may not reignite the commerciality of the R-rated comedy, Rothman had a different recent success to embrace: Animated sequel “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” has already grossed more than a half billion dollars at the global box office, which makes it the third-highest grossing movie of the year so far and already ahead of the $384 million box office that 2018’s “Into the Spider-Verse” made during the same period pre-pandemic.“It was a collection of a tremendous amount of talent, and money, and time,” Rothman said. “I believe movies in movie theaters are a vibrant, strong, viable, leisure choice for movie audiences, have been and will be. That’s an underpinning of the philosophy at this company.”At the same time, Sony has been a beneficiary of the streaming economy. Unlike other studios, Sony has no in-house streaming entity, which means that it can sell its productions on the open market. “We are in business with everyone because we are content makers,” he said, adding that the studio plans to release “Napoleon” in partnership with Apple on Thanksgiving weekend. “That’s a movie Ridley [Scott] made at Apple for Apple and they have determined that it is in the collective interest of their ecosystem to have a theatrical release. I believe these ecosystems can co-exist. I’ve always felt that.”When other companies rushed to change their models during the early months of the pandemic, he said, “People were making conclusions about long-term in a short-term crisis. When other entertainment companies were laying off thousands or in some cases tens of thousands of people, we did not. We invested in our people and we invested in our content.”He’s proud of the global box office performance of live-action “Spider-Man: No Way Home” in 2021, well before “Top Gun: Maverick” became the box office savior of 2022. “Everyone says that Tom Cruise saved the box office,” Rothman said. I can tell you that ‘Spider-Man’ was before that and it showed that movies in movie theaters are enduring.” Yet the Sony chief acknowledged one major area where the market had shifted significantly — the specialty business. Rothman, who founded Fox Searchlight in 1994 and oversees Sony Pictures Classics heads Michael Barker and Tom Bernard, said that the traditional platform release is no longer as viable as it once was. “I think in truth that the traditional long rollout, what I did for many many years at Searchlight, I actually think that is in peril,” he said, “not because those movies aren’t good, they are, not to say they don’t make cultural impact, they do to a certain segment of the audience, but actually the delivery mechanism for that is better at home.”He added that “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” with its successful platform release in 2022, was the exception that proves the rule. “Obviously that happened, so it can happen, but it’s far less typical,” he said. “A bunch of more traditional older-skewing ‘Tars’ and ‘Banshees’ movies don’t break through to the box office levels that they used to. You have to learn to monetize them in other ways.”Rothman also shared his perspective and admiration for movie stars like Jennifer Lawrence, his first producing credit from his indie days, and the rip-roaring story of how he convinced elusive A-list director Peter Weir to take the helm of “Master and Commander.”Watch the full episode above or listen to it below.Screen Talk is produced by Azwan Badruzaman and available on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, and Spotify, and hosted by Megaphone.

        "title": "‘Drive-Away Dolls’ Trailer: Margaret Qualley and Geraldine Viswanathan Go on the Run in Ethan Coen’s Road Trip Comedy",
        "content": "Two years after Joel Coen showed the world what he was capable of as a solo filmmaker with “The Tragedy of Macbeth,” his brother Ethan Coen is preparing to take a similar plunge. Ethan flew solo behind the camera for “Drive-Away Dolls,” his upcoming road trip comedy that he co-wrote with his wife Tricia Cooke. The film, which dropped its first trailer today, appears to fit squarely into the crime-gone-wrong comedic niche that made the Coens household names.According to the film’s official synopsis, “Drive-Away Dolls” follows Jamie, an uninhibited free spirit bemoaning yet another breakup with a girlfriend, and her demure friend Marian who desperately needs to loosen up. In search of a fresh start, the two embark on an impromptu road trip to Tallahassee, but things quickly go awry when they cross paths with a group of inept criminals along the way.“Drive-Away Dolls” stars Margaret Qualley, Geraldine Viswanathan, Pedro Pascal, Matt Damon, Beanie Feldstein, Colman Domingo, and Annie Gonzalez.Though he directed the 2022 rock documentary “Jerry Lee Lewis: Trouble in Mind,” “Drive-Away Dolls” marks Ethan Coen’s first narrative feature since he took an indefinite hiatus from making movies with his brother Joel. While promoting “Trouble in Mind,” Ethan Coen explained that the split was the result of burnout after the difficult process of shooting “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs.”“Nothing happened, certainly nothing dramatic,” Coen said. “You start out when you’re a kid and you want to make a movie. Everything’s enthusiasm and gung-ho, let’s go make a movie. And the first movie is just loads of fun. And then the second movie is loads of fun, almost as much fun as the first. And after 30 years, not that it’s no fun, but it’s more of a job than it had been.”In the same 2022 interview, Ethan Coen refused to rule out the possibility of re-teaming with Joel on another project in the future.“Going our own separate ways sounds like it suggests it might be final,” he said. “But none of this stuff happened definitively. None of the decisions are definitive. We might make another movie.Focus Features will release “Drive-Away Dolls” in theaters on Friday, September 22. Watch the new trailer below.",

        "title": "The Toronto International Film Festival Is Back — and in Force",
        "content": "For Cameron Bailey, CEO of the Toronto International Film Festival, things are looking up. The 2023 event is in-person doing what it does best: accessible, open, public-facing, audience-friendly programming. “Our brand is audience and has been that since the beginning,” said Bailey in a phone interview, alongside programming director Anita Lee.They spoke with IndieWire ahead of their first teaser programming announcement on June 28, to be followed by the release of the TIFF gala and special presentations selections on July 19.Screening attendance last year topped out at 275,000, one of TIFF’s highest numbers since pre-pandemic 2018 and 2019. In 2021, the festival was still coping with border restrictions, but in 2022 “people came back,” said Bailey. Left behind are the pandemic-bred online screenings. “We’ve built our reputation on the in-person experience,” said Bailey. “We have films from big stakeholders, streamers, and studios.”TIFF exhibition space TIFF Bell Lightbox is doing business when it can get more commercial titles such as local hero Sarah Polley’s “Women Talking” and fellow Oscar contender “Triangle of Sadness.” “We made some strategic shifts, focusing on the younger audience,” said Lee. Celine Song’s Sundance hit “Past Lives” is also performing well with younger cinephiles.For decades, TIFF was known as the studio’s fall launchpad. Today, Bailey said, the programming has evolved. “It’s a nice balance between films from the traditional studios and streamers,” he said. “Last year we had Paramount+ and Hulu along with the bigger traditional streamers. All are on the table now.”While the festival grew to a sprawling 260 films in the mid-2010s, Bailey said “it became unwieldy for both press and film stakeholders.” Today, TIFF aims for 200 features, more or less.Bailey, who said he is in touch with sellers on a daily basis, said top Hollywood agencies “are back in a major way. The business wants to do business in person again.”Industry buyers will screen acquisition prospects in Industry Selects market screenings, which are not open to the public but to some invited TIFF members. Last year, Focus Features bought Alexander Payne’s “The Holdovers” (November 22, 2023), a Christmas story starring Paul Giamatti and Da’Vine Joy Randolph, out of Industry Selects.The festival continues to function as an Oscar launchpad. Its tribute awards gala last year went to Michelle Yeoh and Brendan Fraser, who both took home acting Oscars. And some 50 TIFF titles were nominated or won Oscars, said Bailey, including the People’s Choice Award winner, Steven Spielberg’s personal “The Fabelmans.”Of course, Toronto still competes for World Premieres with the Telluride, Venice, London, and New York festivals. “We are all in it for the same reasons,” said Bailey, who thinks that talking each other through the pandemic made his rivals more collegial. “Their elbows are not as sharp.”",

        "title": "Movies and TV Shows with Stars Who Were Canceled Between Production and Release: A Brief(ish) History",
        "content": "The jury’s still out on whether cancel culture means a damn thing for actors in the long term. And yet, at this very moment, you can bet some Hollywood executive is sweating bullets over a star’s personal life. Social media has turned pop culture into a veritable battleground for justice (or ham-fisted fairness, if you like). With a clearer, closer view into celebrities’ offscreen selves, which oh-so-special people get to be in movies and on TV is of particular interest and outrage to the streaming, subscribing, scrolling masses.Sure, we’ve always looked to stories to tell us right from wrong. And yes, tabloid culture is as beloved an American pastime as looking at your phone during a baseball game. But in an age when everyone’s tweeting around the metaphorical campfire, Hollywood has never seemed more like an unofficial extension of our justice system. We all get to talk to everyone all the time. So who are we letting onto the world’s biggest podiums, and why?Whether they’ve got a project in production, just released, or worse still, stuck somewhere in between, those clammy PR people have reason to worry. Actors, regardless of artistry, are the faces of the products that studios, streamers, and networks are trying to sell. Just this spring, Jonathan Majors went from glowing reviews for “Creed III,” a lucrative part in Marvel’s Phase 5, and award hype for “Magazine Dreams” to an uncertain future punctuated with court dates. The actor was arrested in New York City, and charged with multiple counts of assault and harassment. A tidal wave of abuse allegations have followed.Meanwhile, DC Studios saw Ezra Miller — aka comic book history’s most problematic The Flash — plead guilty to one count misdemeanor unlawful trespass in a Vermont court. In exchange, the prosecution dropped felony burglary and petit larceny charges. The actor attributed their ongoing legal struggles, as well as allegations of assault and grooming, to “complex mental health issues.” DC Studios has stood by them thus far, and left the fate of the beloved character in purgatory for now.Dealing with the bad PR of two actors isn’t an existential threat to the superhero sequel machine, of course. (We might soon discover that one unexpected benefit of multiverses is their ability to rationalize any re-castings that a star’s bad behavior might necessitate.) But persona non grata performers are a headache, even for Hollywood’s biggest money makers. The following is an incomplete list of movies and TV shows with stars canceled between production and release. It doubles as a survey of Hollywood’s history with cancel culture and its execs’ evolving strategy for managing actors’ misbehavior.Entries are listed in roughly chronological order; except for Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, who have been reordered to appear together for obvious reasons.Who got canceled and why: Charlie Sheen was written off of “Two and a Half Men” following eight years of playing Charlie Harper on the CBS sitcom. Two months after Sheen was admitted to a rehab facility for drug and alcohol addiction, the actor was fired due to his self-destructive behavior and offensive comments towards the show’s producers.How the network handled it: Ashton Kutcher was brought on as Walden Schmidt, who became the new comedic foil for Jon Cryer’s Alan Harper. Sheen’s character was revealed to have been hit by a subway train. The series finale, however, puts a new spin on Charlie Harper’s absence from the show. The last episode depicts Sheen as a cartoon character who was kidnapped by his admirer Rose, played by Melanie Lynskey. The scene takes a jab at Sheen’s drug addiction, turning his nose as a vacuum inhaling a large pile of sugar. A letter sent to Sheen’s attorney from the network outlines the reasons behind the decision.“At the outset, let us state the obvious: Your client has been engaged in dangerously self-destructive conduct and appears to be very ill.” —MFWho got canceled and why: Danny Masterson was charged with two counts of rape in 2020 and found guilty in his 2023 trial. The assaults took place in the actor’s Hollywood home between 2001-2003. Sentencing for Masterson’s crimes will take place in August, when the actor will face up to 30 years in prison.How the streamer handled it: Masterson was fired from Netflix’s “The Ranch” in 2017, shortly after allegations against him first surfaced. His character, Rooster, was killed in an offscreen accident that resulted in his motorcycle being found at the bottom of a cliff. —MFWho got canceled and why: Louis C.K.’s raunchy comedy empire came crashing down in 2017 when he was accused of masturbating in front of multiple female comedians. Shortly after, C.K. came clean and admitted that he behaved inappropriately. “These stories are true,” C.K. said in a statement. “At the time, I said to myself that what I did was okay because I never showed a woman my dick without asking first, which is also true. But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your dick isn’t a question. It’s a predicament for them. The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly.”How Hollywood handled it: C.K. was working on a variety of projects at the time, which forced multiple companies to make their own decisions about how to proceed. Universal Pictures tapped Patton Oswalt to take over C.K.’s voice role in “The Secret Life of Pets 2.” While FX never explicitly cancelled “Louie,” C.K. was forced to step away from his writing and producing duties on shows like “Better Things” and “Baskets.” The allegations also cast a shadow over his film “I Love You, Daddy,” which C.K. wrote, directed, and starred in. The film had already premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival by the time the allegations came out, but it never received a theatrical or streaming release. —MFWho got canceled and why: Kevin Spacey, who was set to play oil tycoon J. Paul Getty in Ridley Scott’s ‘70s set thriller. In October, two months before “All the Money in the World” was scheduled to premiere, actor Anthony Rapp went public with accusations that Spacey had sexually assaulted him when he was 14-years-old. More than a dozen other men came forward with similar accusations of sexual misconduct against Spacey shortly afterwards. Spacey, who seemingly attempted to shield himself from criticism by coming out as gay, faced three separate legal cases from the accusations. All of these ended in Spacey favor, were dismissed, or were dropped. Currently, Spacey is facing charges in the United Kingdom, in a trial in London on four counts of sexual assault.How the studio handled it: To the extent that cancellation is a real thing, Spacey got thoroughly canceled. He was fired from “House of Cards,” which proceeded with a sixth and final season without him, and a Gore Vidal biopic he was tapped to star in was shelved. For “All the Money in the World,” Scott reshot Spacey’s scenes as Getty a month before its release, now with the much more age-appropriate Christopher Plummer in the role. Remarkably, the scenes only took eight days to reshoot, and the film managed to hit its intended release date. —WCWho got canceled and why: Jefferey Tambor’s Emmy-winning run on the Prime Video series “Transparent” ended in 2017 when he was accused of inappropriate behavior on set. The controversy, which included sexual misconduct accusations, took place at the peak of the #MeToo movement. Although the actor took responsibility for his challenging temperament, he denied the more serious claims. “Lines got blurred. I was difficult. I was mean,” said Tambor, who blamed some of his behavior on the stress of playing a transgender character as a cisgender man.How the studio handled it: Following an internal investigation from Amazon Studios, showrunner Jill Soloway cut ties with Tambor and began reworking the fifth and final season without the actor’s involvement. “I am profoundly disappointed in Amazon’s handling of these false accusations against me,” said Tambor. —MFWho got canceled and why: T.J. Miller, best known for starring in “Silicon Valley.” In late 2017, after starring in “The Emoji Movie,” Miller was the subject of numerous public controversies, including domestic violence and sexual assault allegations and accusations of transphobic harrassment by film critic Danielle Solzman. In April 2018, he got arrested after calling in a fake bomb threat while drunk on an Amtrak train, and later that year was accused of bullying behavior on the set of “Silicon Valley” by recurring actor Alice Wetterlund. How the studio handled it: Miller left “Silicon Valley” in May before the accusations against him became public, but the actor had already filmed scenes for the blockbuster “Deadpool 2” and recorded voice lines for the third “How to Train Your Dragon” movie. “Deadpool 2” went ahead, but star Ryan Reynolds made it clear Miller would not return for future sequels. Dreamworks Animation, meanwhile, had Miller’s role in “The Hidden World” overdubbed by Justin Rupple. —WCWho got canceled and why: Director Woody Allen. In 1992, Allen was publicly accused by his ex-partner Mia Farrow of sexually abusing their adopted daughter Dylan Farrow when she was seven years old. Allen, who began a relationship the year before with Farrow’s adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, denied the allegations, and largely continued on with his career unaffected, earning nine Oscar nominations and winning Best Original Screenplay in 2011 for “Midnight in Paris.” Allen didn’t face real pushback until 2017, when the Me Too movement (kickstarted in part by the journalism work of Allen’s son Ronan Farrow) caused a re-examination of the allegation, and Dylan Farrow published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times about her abuse.How the studio handled it:Starring Timothée Chalamet, Elle Fanning, and Selena Gomez, the film was shot in 2017 and originally set for a big release from Amazon in 2018. However, the studio halted the release due to the resurfaced accusation, and eventually dropped the movie entirely. It was ultimately released by MPI Media Group in 2020.Several actors on the film, including Chalamet and Gomez, publicly apologized for working with Allen and donated their salaries to nonprofits, including Time’s Up and RAINN. —WCWho got canceled and why: The titular star Roseanne Barr. When the comedian’s acclaimed ‘90s sitcom “Roseanne” was revived by ABC in March 2018, it became a massive ratings success for the channel. The revival, which played into conservative and pro-Trump sensibilities, was quickly renewed for a second season. But in May, Barr, who had been an outspoken Trump supporter for years, tweeted a racist joke comparing Obama era senior advisor Valerie Jarrett to an ape.    How the studio handled it: ABC effectively canceled “Roseanne” as audiences knew it, and instead went ahead with “The Conners”: the same show minus its namesake.The same night that Barr tweeted her joke, then-ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey announced the show had been canceled, and Hulu removed the entire series from its library. Eventually, ABC reached a deal with Barr to remove herself as an executive producer, and the series was retooled as “The Conners,” focusing on Roseanne’s family after her death. The show remained a success, and has been renewed for a sixth season. —WCWho got canceled and why: Lori Loughlin did not return in Season 5 of the Netflix series “Fuller House” following her conviction in the college admissions scandal that saw her pay $500,000 for fake athletic credentials for her two daughters in an attempt to enhance their college resumes. Loughlin plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud and served two months in prison.How the streamer handled it: Loughlin’s Aunt Becky was written out of the fifth and final season of the “Full House” spin-off. When her on-screen husband Jesse (John Stamos) is left to decide how to parent his daughter alone, D.J. (Candace Cameron) asks her uncle to consider Becky’s input. Stamos responds by saying “Becky is in Nebraska helping out her mother. I don’t want to bother her with a tiny little thing like this.” —MFWho got canceled and why: Joey Gugliemelli, also known as Sherry Pie. Between filming the main competition for “RuPaul’s Drag Race” Season 12 and its final episode, Gugliemelli faced multiple allegations of sexual abuse and became the second contestant ever disqualified from the reality drag competition. Victims detailed a casting couch/catfishing scheme, through which Gugliemelli posed as an industry professional and coerced aspiring performers to make and send sexually suggestive materials.How the network handled it: Accusations against Gulgiemelli surfaced shortly before the Season 12 premiere. VH1 and production company World of Wonder had just enough time to remove Sherry Pie from much of the American broadcast — though original cuts of the show aired internationally, with side-by-side comparisons becoming a staple of social media intrigue that season. Each episode was introduced with a disclaimer slate explaining the disqualification — citing Gulgiemelli’s public apology, in which he stated he was “horribly embarrassed” and “disgusted [with himself.]”The episode disclaimer read, in part, “Out of respect for the hard work of the other queens, VH1 will air the season as planned. Sherry Pie will not appear in the grand finale scheduled to be filmed later this spring.” The production gap coincided with the start of COVID-19 lockdown and forced the Season 12 finale to go virtual. Sherry Pie didn’t appear, despite qualifying during the semi-finals, and many of Gugliemelli’s solo looks were cut from the show. Portions of Gugliemelli’s performance aired for continuity and context. —AF Who got canceled and why: Chris D’Elia, best known for his work as a stand-up comic and appearances in shows like “You.” D’Elia shot his role in “Army of the Dead,” a zombie action Netflix movie from Zack Snyder, in summer 2019. A year later, several women came forward on Twitter alleging that the comedian sexually harassed them, solicited nude photos, and groomed them while they were underage. The response was immediate; Creative Artists Agency dropped D’Elia as a client, and his 2013 special “White Male. Black Comic” (yes, really) was removed from streaming by Comedy Central, along with an episode of the sitcom “Workaholics” where he played a child predator. He’s only continued to face more accusations in the years since.How the streamer handled it: Rather than awkwardly having to talk about D’Elia in the press run up to “Army of the Dead,” Netflix opted to wash their hands of the disgraced comedian entirely and recast his role. For his replacement, they went with another stand-up in Tig Notaro, who ultimately played helicopter pilot Marianne in the final release. Since the controversy happened during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, replacing D’Elia proved more difficult than simple reshoots; Notaro shot her scenes against a green screen over the course of two weeks, with only one of her co-stars (Ana de la Reguera) returning to film. She was inserted via CGI into the final project. —WCWho got canceled and why: Shia LaBeouf, the actor of “Transformers” and “Even Stevens” origins. While the former child star had a history of violent behavior and legal issues beforehand, the tipping point for him was when his former romantic partner, musician FKA Twigs, filed a lawsuit against him in December 2020. Twigs alleged sexual battery, assault, and infliction of emotional distress. LaBeouf’s civil trial is scheduled for later this year.How the streamer handled it: The lawsuit occurred shortly before the Netflix premiere of the 2021 film “Pieces of a Woman,” which LaBeouf starred in opposite Vanessa Kirby. Netflix scrubbed LaBeouf from the film’s awards campaign, but otherwise did not publicly comment on the lawsuit; Kirby went on to get nominated for an Oscar for her work. LaBeouf took a hiatus from acting, before starring in the 2022 film “Padre Pio” and joining the cast of Francis Ford Coppola’s “Megalopolis,” which is expected in 2024. —WCWho got canceled and why: Gina Carano was fired from “The Mandalorian,” in 2021 following a series of controversial tweets made at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The outspoken Republican took to Twitter to voice her frustrations on pandemic policies and Jeffery Epstein’s sudden death — and the final straw may have been her ill-advised decision to compare the treatment of Trump supporters in America to that of Jews in Nazi Germany.How the studio handled it: Following the tweets, Disney immediately wiped its hands clean of Carano’s character, Cara Dune. Although the show didn’t completely kill off Dune, her story continues someplace far, far away from the hit Disney+ story. “It’s a big galaxy, and we have many characters in it—many characters are fighting for their screen time,” said the show’s executive producer Rick Famuyiwa in a recent interview with Deadline. —MFWho got canceled and why: Allegations against Armie Hammer first surfaced in January 2021 when an Instagram account under the name “House of Effie” accused the actor of rape and other acts of violent sexual behavior. Hammer denied the allegations before charges were eventually dropped by LAPD.How the studio handled it: At the time of the allegations, 20th Century Studios had already shot Hammer’s scenes on the mystery-thriller “Death on the Nile.” According to The Hollywood Reporter, the studio had considered multiple options — including reshooting Hammer’s scenes — but the logistics didn’t seem realistic. The studio ultimately decided to do nothing, releasing the film as is without highlighting Hammer’s presence in any marketing campaigns. The large ensemble cast and Hammer’s relatively small role allowed the controversy to fly under the radar. —MFWho got canceled and why: Model and TV personality Chrissy Teigen. In May 2021, reality TV star Courtney Stodden spoke in an interview with The Daily Beast about media treatment they received as a teenager in the early 2000s, after they were groomed by 51-year-old Doug Hutchison and married him at 16. Stodden specifically called out Teigen for sending tweets and direct messages telling them to kill themself. Other TV personalities, such as Michael Costello and Farrah Abraham, made similar allegations of harassment, and Teigen posted a lengthy apology admitting to her cruel treatment of Stodden.How the streamer handled it: One of the central gimmicks of Netflix series “Never Have I Ever” is that real-life celebrities play themselves as the narrators of high school storylines; the majority of the series revolves around Devi (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) and is narrated by tennis great John McEnroe. For Season 2 in 2021, Teigen was tapped to narrate an episode focusing on Devi’s love interest Paxton (Darren Barnet). But following the Stodden controversy, just a few weeks before the show’s June premiere, Teigen exited the series; spokespeople for Netflix said it was Teigen’s decision. Ultimately, fellow model Gigi Hadid took over as narrator for the episode, and would return in the show’s fourth and final season for another episode focusing on Paxton. —WCWho got canceled and why: Johnny Depp. In November 2016, Depp joined J.K. Rowling’s Wizarding World as Gellert Grindelwald: a dark wizard and the cameo kicker to the first Harry Potter spinoff, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.” The movie premiered roughly six months after ex-wife Amber Heard accused Depp of extended physical and psychological abuse during their marriage. Despite how easy it would have been to redo one cameo scene, Depp reprised his role as Gellert Grindelwald in 2018; this time as a starring character in the sequel “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.”How the studio handled it: Depp was ousted from numerous projects following Heard’s disclosure; most notably, parting ways with Disney’s “Pirates of the Caribbean” franchise. No stranger to cancellation herself these days (thanks to her anti-trans commentary that reached a fever pitch in 2020), Rowling stood behind Depp in a December 2017 statement.“Based on our understanding of the circumstances, the filmmakers and I are not only comfortable sticking with our original casting, but genuinely happy to have Johnny playing a major character in the movies,” the author wrote.Warner Bros.’ film premiered as planned that fall. But Heard’s allegations were met by Depp’s own accusations of abuse, and the couple’s fraught split subsequently played out in two heavily publicized civil trials. In November 2020, Depp lost his first suit: a claim of libel against the U.K. publication The Sun, which ran a story referring to the actor as a “wife beater.” Given the judge’s ruling in favor of The Sun, Warner Bros. asked Depp to leave the then unnamed “Fantastic Beasts 3.” He reportedly received a $16 million pay-day for the project, despite having shot only one scene to that point. Depp was replaced with Mads Mikkelsen.Heard and Depp faced each other again in spring 2022 over claims of defamation in a Washington Post op-ed, penned by Heard. This time they appeared in a Virginia court, which found in favor of Depp and awarded him $10 million compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages. The jury found that a statement by one of Depp’s attorneys also defamed Heard; she was given $2 million in compensatory damages and a zero-dollar punitive damages payout. —AFWho got canceled and why: Amber Heard. Filing for divorce and successfully petitioning for a temporary restraining order in May 2016, Heard accused her ex-husband Johnny Depp of domestic and sexual violence throughout their two-year marriage. The split was finalized in January 2017 and the former couple issued a peaceful joint statement, which read in part, “Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm.” Depp re-raised the issue the following year, when he brought suits against The Sun and The Washington Post. Throughout this time, he made particularly colorful allegations of physical and psychological abuse against Heard.How the studio handled it: In a counterclaim, Heard argued Depp coordinated an online harassment campaign built on false claims designed to defame her and damage her career. Petitions to remove Heard from a L’Oreal beauty campaign as well as DC Studios’ forthcoming “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” circulated online. Despite losing (partially winning, but mostly losing) the definitive Depp v. Heard case, the actress will reprise her role of oceanic warrior Mera in the superhero sequel out this December.“The disappointment I feel today is beyond words,” Heard said at the time of the verdict. “I’m heartbroken that the mountain of evidence still was not enough to stand up to the disproportionate power, influence, and sway of my ex-husband. I’m even more disappointed with what this verdict means for other women. It is a setback. It sets back the clock to a time when a woman who spoke up and spoke out could be publicly shamed and humiliated.” —AFWho got canceled and why: Ezra Miller, aka the titular Flash. Beginning with an alleged choking incident in 2020, the actor faced a series of legal troubles, as well as assault and grooming allegations, that they have since attributed to “complex mental health issues.” Miller plead guilty to misdemeanor unlawful trespass in a Vermont court earlier this year. In exchange, the prosecution dropped two county, felony burglary and petit larceny charges. They are currently on probation.How the studio handled it: James Gunn and Peter Safran, the newly minted co-CEOs of DC Studios, aren’t yet severing ties with Miller.\n“Ezra is completely committed to their recovery, and we are fully supportive of that journey that they’re on right now,” Safran said in January 2023. “When the time is right, when they feel like they’re ready to have the discussion, we’ll all figure out what the best path forward is. Right now, they are completely focused on their recovery. In our conversations with them over the last couple of months, it feels like they’re making enormous progress.” Resurfacing at “The Flash” premiere (which, yes, they were still invited to despite doing no other press for the film), Miller thanked Gunn and Safran for their “grace and discernment and care in the context of my life.”Director Andy Muschietti, who Gunn and Safran recently hired to direct the upcoming Batman movie “The Brave and the Bold,” has similarly said he will not replace Miller as “The Flash.” The future of any sequels involving the actor or character is unclear. —AFWho got canceled and why: Will Smith. A rundown of what happened with Smith seems redundant, but if you somehow missed it… During the 2022 Oscars ceremony, the same night he won Best Actor, Smith unexpectedly took the stage and slapped presenter Chris Rock in the face. The altercation occurred after Rock made a now notorious joke about Smith’s wife Jada Pinkett-Smith.   How the studio handled it: Although Smith was immediately remorseful for the slap, he still faced intense blowback from the media and the industry at large over the incident. The Academy banned him from their events for 10 years, and Netflix reportedly halted development on a film starring him after the public controversy. However, “Emancipation,” an Apple film starring Smith as an enslaved man escaping to freedom, still premiered that fall. Director Antoine Fuqua defended Smith in press interviews, calling the film’s story “more important than one bad moment.” —WCWho got canceled and why: “Rick and Morty” faced an existential threat in January 2023 when allegations of domestic violence surfaced against the show’s co-creator and voice actor Justin Roiland. Roiland faced two charges of domestic battery with corporal injury and false imprisonment by menace, violence, fraud and/or deceit, but lack of evidence led to the case being dropped in March 2023.How the network handled it: Although Roiland won’t face legal consequences, the show will proceed with new actors voicing the two eponymous characters. “Rick and Morty” producer Steve Levy believes that the show’s transition will go smoothly because other creative elements remain unchanged. “The writing quality has never been better, and all the screenwriters have stayed. I don’t think anyone will bat an eyelid hearing the new voices,” Levy said in a recent interview with Premiere. —MFWho got canceled and why: Jonathan Majors, who plays the character of Kang in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and won acclaim out of 2023’s Sundance Festival for his performance as a bodybuilder in the film “Magazine Dreams.” In March, right after starring in Michael B. Jordan’s debut “Creed III,” Majors was arrested in New York on charges of assault, strangulation, and harassment. Following the news, several people came forward with allegations that Majors exhibited abusive behavior, and Variety reported several alleged victims had begun cooperating with the Manhattan district attorney’s office on a case against the actor.How the studio handled it: While Majors’ trial remains an ongoing concern, Disney is staying quiet. The actor hasn’t officially been cast in any future MCU films, although his character is expected to be the main villain of the franchise’s overall storyline going forward. Majors is expected to be in “Loki” Season 2, premiering on Disney+ in October.Disney’s subsidiary Searchlight Pictures acquired “Magazine Dreams” out of Sundance, and that film will also be released in December. Disney and Searchlight have yet to make any public statements about their future relationships with Majors. —WC",

        "title": "‘God Is a Bullet’ Review: Nihilistic Revenge Thriller Doesn’t Believe in Anything — Including Plot",
        "content": "A movie about a pair of unlikely friends teaming up to infiltrate a cult is always going to rest on two things: the friends having chemistry and the cult being interesting. You’d really prefer to have both of those elements working for you, but a filmmaker can get by as long as one of them is strong. Unfortunately for everyone involved, “God Is a Bullet” has neither.Nick Cassavetes’ adaptation of Boston Teran’s novel of the same name is an ambitious mess that features wild highs (a snake doing meth!) and impossibly dull lows (most everything else). Overly long and gratuitously violent, the bloated revenge thriller seems obsessed with reminding us of how much evil is in the world without showing the slightest bit of interest in explaining how it got there.The one thing everyone in Detective Bob Hightower’s (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) life can agree on is that he’s not particularly useful. His colleagues at the police department might respect his work ethic, but they ultimately dismiss him as a “desk cowboy” and a “seat warmer” who shouldn’t be trusted with any real cases. His ex-wife and her new husband ridicule him and largely keep him out of his teenage daughter’s life. The only things going for him are his deep faith in God and his belief that bad things don’t happen in his small Christian town.The latter belief is shattered — and the former seriously tested — when he goes to visit his daughter Gabi (Chloe Guy) on Christmas morning and finds the house ransacked with several dead bodies left inside. His ex-wife is dead, and his daughter is nowhere to be found. Convinced that the absence of a body means that Gabi is alive somewhere, he opts to throw every police resource he has at finding the guys who took her.His research leads him to Case Hardin (Maika Monroe), a reformed drug addict who escaped a cult of tattooed child traffickers who kidnapped Gabi. Her off-the-record testimony confirms that all of the evidence left at the house points to them, but Bob’s supervisor John Lee (Paul Johansson) prohibits him from investigating the case in a formal manner. When Case shows up at his doorstep and says that the only way to find Gabi is to work outside the law, he agrees to cross over to the dark side and hit the road with her. Case is as blunt and cynical is Bob is reserved, but the odd couple decides to bring his daughter back or die trying.She introduces him to a shady dealmaker known only as The Ferryman (Jamie Foxx), a power broker with vitiligo who hooks the strait-laced cop up with the fake ID and tattoos that he’ll need to infiltrate a Satanic death cult. The encounter gives us our first real look at main obstacle that could impede this rescue mission: these motherfuckers are scary. But while we spend plenty of time exploring the cult’s sadistic tendencies and complicated tattoos, there’s never enough mythology to justify how long we spend watching Bob and Case’s meandering journey into the guts of the organization. Evil for evil’s sake only gets you so far.Despite a premise that could have been ripped from a generic Liam Neeson vehicle, the film keeps drifting into wannabe Nicholas Winding Refn territory and forcing us to sit through endless scenes of sad people chilling in neon-tinged bars with evil vibes. A tighter edit that prioritized the rescue plot over meandering character development probably could have turned “God Is a Bullet” into a fun airplane movie, but Cassavetes’ arthouse ambitions always resurface at inopportune times. There’s definitely a market for the kind of straightforward thriller that “God Is a Bullet” seems to want to be, but there was absolutely no reason for this story to take two and a half hours.If it wasn’t clear from the title, much of that running time padding is devoted to nihilistic screeds about how nothing matters. In the film’s worldview, organized religion and satanic death cults are just two sides of the same coin. They’re both clubs that suckers get duped into joining as a way of deflecting their anxiety about death and the endless void that follows.The only thing that actually has the kind of power that we like to ascribe to deities is — you guessed it — a bullet. The intention may have been Cormac McCarthy-style poetry, but the script only delivers heavy-handed preaching that continues to pull us away from what’s left of the story. By the time the inevitable bloody climax arrives, it’s hard to care about anyone’s fate when the film has spent so much time trying to rid us of natural human emotions. Say what you will about the tenets of formulaic screenwriting, but at least it’s an ethos.“God Is a Bullet” opens in theaters nationwide on Friday, June 23.",

        "content": "Tom Cruise may be fine cruising off a cliff on a motorcycle for a film stunt, but the actor draws the line at physical contact with co-stars.“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” actress Pom Klementieff revealed to Entertainment Weekly that she begged co-star Cruise to kick her in the midsection during an action scene. Cruise, however, refused.“I kept telling him to just kick me here,” Klementieff said. “I was squeezing abs. [I said], ‘You can just go for it.’ He was like ‘No, no, no, no, no.’ I was like, ‘But it’s going to help me!’ But he wouldn’t do it.”The “Guardians of the Galaxy” star also spoke about the production as a whole, saying, “It was so special to be on location in Rome. We were shooting during COVID, so we were very lucky to be here. I was trying to not laugh too much because I was having so much fun in the car following the Fiat.”She added of her alter ego, “When Christopher McQuarrie cast me for the role, he didn’t know which name the character would have. It was cool to name me Paris, me being from France, and then they decided that I would speak French because I speak French in real life. [Paris] is very different style-wise from every other actress in the ‘Mission: Impossible’ franchise. She has a side that’s a bit more punk and she doesn’t really give a fuck. So that was cool.”   Director McQuarrie agreed, saying Paris is a “chaotic element” of the action film.“It doesn’t matter how deep in the background she is, you’re going to be watching her at all times and wondering what she’s going to do,” he said. “She’s a rebel, she’s a killer, she’s extremely skilled and quite lonely too.”“Dead Reckoning” also features one of McQuarrie’s long-dreamed-of stunts: crashing a 70-ton train.“We’re enormous fans of Buster Keaton, John Frankenheimer, David Lean, all of these filmmakers who at one time or another had a fabulous train wreck,” McQuarrie said earlier this year of working with lead actor, producer, and visionary collaborator Cruise. “I thought, ‘I’ve earned that, I want to wreck one too.’ I think the energy that went into developing it, designing that, building it, and then making a sequence that justified its existence was probably the biggest challenge of my entire life.”",

        "title": "Priscilla Presley Gives ‘Priscilla’ Biopic Her Blessing: Sofia Coppola Is ‘Masterful’",
        "content": "Priscilla Presley is praising Sofia Coppola‘s “Priscilla.”Adapted from Presley’s 1985 memoir, “Elvis and Me,” the A24 film stars Cailee Spaeny as Priscilla and Jacob Elordi as Elvis Presley.“I am excited about the interpretation of my book by the masterful Sofia Coppola,” Presley shared on Instagram. “She has such an extraordinary perspective and I have always been such an admirer of her work. I’m certain this movie will take everyone on an emotional journey.”The film centers on a teenage Priscilla Beaulieu, who meets Elvis Presley at a party, and the rock ‘n roll superstar becomes someone entirely unexpected in private moments: a thrilling crush, an ally in loneliness, a vulnerable best friend.Presley’s comments come on the heels of the teaser trailer being released, as well as reports that the Elvis Presley estate was unaware of “Priscilla” being produced. An estate official told TMZ that writer-director Coppola’s vision of Graceland is inaccurate, calling the first look at the film “like a college movie.”Presley is an executive producer on “Priscilla,” and Coppola told Vogue earlier this year that she has met Presley “a few times” and that the singer has been “incredibly open” with her life story.“She’s also been really supportive of Cailee as we head into filming,” Coppola said. “It’s really unique to talk to her about the film since I’ve never made something about a real person who was still living — ‘The Bling Ring’ aside. But I want it to feel emotionally authentic. She’s probably told these stories a million times, so I feel grateful that she’s been so patient. It’s amazing how much detail she can recall from that time in her life.”Presley previously supported Baz Luhrmann’s 2022 biopic “Elvis” starring Olivia DeJonge as Priscilla and Oscar-nominated actor Austin Butler as Elvis. However, Coppola noted that “Priscilla” will be a very different type of film.“I think Baz is so unique, and his take on that story was so creative,” Coppola told Vogue. “But Priscilla is such a minor character in that film, so I never felt like I was treading on the same territory…Priscilla is the real focus of [this movie]. There are some aspects of Elvis’s career included, but it all sort of plays out in the background of their relationship and her developing her identity. I loved how Baz approached his story in a very collage-y way, but I’m glad it didn’t go into much of Priscilla’s story because now I can really dive deep.”",

        "title": "Paramount as We Know It Has 2 Years Left, at Most — Analyst",
        "content": "The same analyst who said he believes Paramount should just shut down its streaming business has further thoughts on the future of Paramount Global: It doesn’t have one.Equity analyst Steven Cahall of bank Wells Fargo gives Paramount Corp. another “1-2 years” of throwing “good money… after bad,” chasing a streaming profit that may never come, and riding out the last gasps of linear television, before “the break-up becomes inevitable.”The “good money” within Paramount Global lies inside its studios, which Cahall sees as worth about $30 billion in a sale, per a note he sent to clients on Thursday. We obtained said note; Cahall sees the whole of the company as currently structured as worth $22.3 billion. Yes, that’s the bad. (Paramount itself tours an enterprise value of about $28 billion.)Unlocking value is the trend in the media landscape these days: look no further than Lionsgate for another example of a studio considered worth more alone than the entire umbrella company in which it resides.An alternative to burning lots of cash for little return? Paramount could pull a Lionsgate and divvy up itself now. (It wasn’t long ago that we wrote Paramount might consider acquiring Starz from Lionsgate. Business is changing at a pace that rivals The Flash.) Sure, the linear television channels and direct-to-consumer businesses would be “sold at deep discounts,” but “a rare gem” in Cahall’s words, are Paramount Studios and CBS Studios.Those pieces could see “significant” interest from streamers if put on the sales block. Business Insider on Wednesday reported that Netflix was once very much in the market for those pieces. The problem was — or perhaps still is — that Netflix had no use for Paramount’s other assets.That’s the general consensus surrounding Paramount Global: It’s got great studios and a deep library, but the suite of cable channels and other antiquated assets belong in the bargain bin. Even broadcast network CBS, despite regularly drawing the most viewers on television, is more of a burden than a blessing in potential M&A activity.For example, NBCUniversal parent Comcast would have good reason (and good money) to buy Paramount Global in its entirety — heck, Paramount+ could even be the thing that saves Peacock — but owning both NBC and CBS is an FCC no-no.Paramount Global has been working to build up its balance sheet. The company has tried to sell off publisher Simon & Schuster for years and appears to be nearing another billion-dollar-plus deal — one that hopefully won’t get caught up in regulatory red tape. (Last November, the Department of Justice killed a $2.2 billion sale to Penguin Random House for reasons similar to why the Federal Communications Commission won’t allow two broadcast networks to operate under one roof.)The company is also unloading its famous New York City headquarters. Paramount’s studio lot in Los Angeles was reportedly among the assets Netflix was interested in acquiring.A Netflix rep did not immediately respond to IndieWire’s request for comment on the prior talks. A spokesperson for Paramount Global likewise did not respond to us for this story.Paramount is currently seeking bids for its BET Group for in the $3 billion-plus range; Tyler Perry, who already owns 25 percent of BET, appears to be the auction’s frontrunner. Paramount’s preschool brand, Noggin, is also seeking a new owner. And last month, Paramount Global controller National Amusements Inc. got a $125 million cash infusion from merchant bank BDT & MSD Partners.These sales and investments are merely buying of Paramount Global non-executive chairwoman Shari Redstone — and by proxy, Bob Bakish — more time to delay the inevitable, in Cahall’s eyes. Or in his words: “To stay the value-destructive course.”",

        "title": "This Weekend at the Box Office: Critical Darlings and a Raunchy Comedy Must Answer Some Key Questions",
        "content": "Last weekend was a critical test of the summer box office, with results more negative than positive. This weekend has the opportunity to change that course.This late June weekend is normally a high point. The last five years pre-pandemic, it saw an average gross of around $200 million (and at lower ticket prices). This year it may struggle to reach $120 million, once unheard of for any weekend between May and mid-August.“No Hard Feelings,” a $48 million R-rated comedy from Sony with producer Jennifer Lawrence starring as a woman hired to help a shy and inexperienced 19-year-old gain confidence, will be a four-prong test: an original non-franchise film, a female lead, a comedy, and rated R. Should it perform, it could expand standard production assumptions.This weekend will also see the expansion of two specialized films. Wider response to Wes Anderson’s “Asteroid City” (Focus) and first-time filmmaker Celine Song’s “Past Lives” (A24) will send strong signals about the recovery of this struggling critical sector of theatrical play.DC Comics’ “The Flash” and Pixar’s “Elemental” opened to dramatic shortfalls, but “Elemental” shows signs of stabilizing. “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” also continues to hold well; either could challenge “The Flash” and “No Hard Feelings” among the top films for the week. While these will be the weekend’s top four films, the actual order contains multiple possibilities.At mid-week, “No Hard Feelings” tracked to a $12 million opening — underwhelming, both for its expense and its potential. Non-animated comedies can do better — “Cocaine Bear” opened to $23 million with less star power earlier this year. When well received, non-franchise films sometimes thrive more after their initial response; that word-of-mouth factor should be kept in mind in judging its opening gross. The film is notching mixed reviews (Metacritic currently stands at 57).The idea that a producing a mass-audience film starring Jennifer Lawrence qualifies as a risk seems absurd, yet that’s what Sony has done. This kind of film used to be a summer staple (see “Risky Business,” “American Pie,” “There’s Something About Mary”) and perhaps it can again.Both “Asteroid City” and “Past Lives” look like they will pass $10 million domestic gross — a level that eluded most of last year’s awards contenders. Although they share two-city platform starts (unusual these days), their expansions have different trajectories.After its staggering $1 million gross in only six theaters for its first four days, “Asteroid City” opens at 1,668 theaters. It helps that filmmaker Wes Anderson has a devoted following and past successes (led by “The Grand Budapest Hotel” in 2014, which saw a $55 million gross).After several films with Searchlight, Focus hopes to improve on “The French Dispatch” in 2021. Anderson’s previous film faced late-COVID issues, but managed to gross $16.1 million. It opened in 52 theaters and expanded in its second week to 2,602 and $2.6 million. The “Asteroid City” opening comes with soft competition, a well-known ensemble cast, and a sense of intrigue. Giving audiences something fresh is an underrated asset.A conservative guess for the “Asteroid City” weekend would be around $5 million, with an ultimate $20 million or higher domestic gross. Combined with international totals and likely PVOD interest (likely before late summer) would be a winning result.“Past Lives” enters its fourth week with only 297 theaters planned (up from its current 212). It has grossed over $2 million in limited play and last weekend’s per-theater average of $8,951 compares well to most key Oscar players last season. This in-house A24 production has an uncertain budget, but likely one that a domestic gross of $10 million or better, along with other later revenues, would make profitable.The success of a sensitive drama that’s not propelled by a known director or stars, with older- audience appeal and outside the awards season, would be a terrific boost for the specialized film industry. A24’s slower release also means core specialized theaters are more central to the release pattern. Maximizing gross without the higher expense of a much wider release would be doubly positive.Next week, summer business as usual returns with the release of “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” (Disney), with a reported $295 million budget and uncertain blockbuster potential.",

        "content": "James Cameron is speaking out on the tragic Titan submersible voyage.The Oscar winner and avid underwater adventurer told ABC News that after participating in over 33 dives, he is well-acquainted with the dangers of deep-sea exploration.“I’m struck by the similarity of the Titanic disaster itself, where the captain was repeatedly warned about ice ahead of his ship, and yet he steamed at full speed into an ice field on a moonless night. And many people died as a result, and for a very similar tragedy, where warnings went unheeded, to take place at the same exact site, with all the diving that’s going on all around the world, I think it’s just astonishing,” Cameron said. “It’s really quite surreal, and of course, PH [Paul-Henry Nargeolet], the French legendary submersible dive pilot, is a friend of mine. It’s a very small community. I’ve known PH for 25 years for him to have died tragically in this way is almost impossible for me to process.”The Titan submersible was operated by OceanGate Expeditions. Five people, including Nargeloet, were aboard the vessel that went missing on Sunday in the Atlantic Ocean near the site of the Titanic shipwreck. OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush was piloting the submarine.Per a press conference held Thursday afternoon, debris from the submersible was found 1,600 feet from the bow of the Titanic. The submersible is thought to have succumbed to a catastrophic implosion after being unable to withstand the ocean’s pressure at such depths.“Well, I’ve been down there many times. I know the right side very well,” Cameron said. “I actually calculated that I spent more time on the ship than the captain did back in the day. And of course, as a submersible designer myself, I designed and built a sub to go to the deepest place in the ocean, three times deeper than the Titanic. So I understand the engineering problems associated with building this type of vehicle and all the safety protocols you have to go through.”“On behalf of the United States Coast Guard and the entire unified command, I offer my deepest condolences to the families,” Rear Admiral John Mauger said in a news conference (via The New York Times).Watch Cameron’s full ABC News statement below.‘Titanic’ director James Cameron on the ‘catastrophic implosion’ of Titan submersible: “I’m struck by the similarity of the Titanic disaster itself, where the captain was repeatedly warned about ice ahead of his ship and yet he steamed at full speed into an ice field.\" pic.twitter.com/vO8JkCXS5f",

        "title": "‘Elemental’ Turned to a Surprising Inspiration to Get Fire and Water to Kiss: ‘Requiem for a Dream’",
        "content": "[Editor’s note: The following interview contains spoilers.]One of the most difficult tech challenges in Pixar’s “Elemental” was conveying what happens when fire and water — the intense Ember (Leah Lewis) and sensitive Wade (Mamoudou Athie) — finally touch after falling in love. After all, fire and water don’t mix and Ember resists the temptation throughout the studio’s first rom-com because of the danger. But she can’t resist any longer after spending a sublime moment together in an underwater garden. The result is a new chemical reaction that grows stronger and induces them to dance and eventually kiss.“There was so much tension of what this contact was, the fear that they could be killing each other,” director Peter Sohn told IndieWire. “What is this chemistry? Is it magnetic, electrical? This boiling, this roiling?”“Pete told me he was in Hawaii on vacation, and his kids were at the pool, and he boarded it,” VFX supervisor Sanjay Bakshi told IndieWire. “And he had this idea in his mind of what would happen when they touch and visually how to go into that macroscopic view, where you see fire flame up, you see water really become active and then steam, and the sound effect is like buzzing. And he wanted it to be relatable, like the first time you touched someone that you’re really interested in and you get those goosebumps.”The touch was uncharted territory for the couple and Pixar alike. It represented the culmination of the animation studio’s first stab at fully simulated, volumetric characters. Pixar studied chemical reactions for fire and water along with macro-photography (even referencing Darren Aronofsky’s “Requiem for a Dream”). “Visually, there’s a macroscopic view of injecting a needle, taking drugs, and what that chemical reaction is like,” Bakshi said. “We wanted to observe going from that wider angle to a macroscopic view and then going back out wide again.”After all that reference, though, the artists took artistic license in creating the romantic chemistry. The flames react and float along Ember’s arm to her hand, while the water bubbles rush from Wade’s arm to his hand.“You feel like they’re doing something internal to protect themselves or prepare for it,” Bakshi said. “So there’s a lot of specific effects work that’s showing how they’re preparing for that touch. And then once they are able to touch, they interlock fingers. Eventually, they go into almost an embrace and, as Ember leans into Wade, you see steam coming off in the bubbles, going to the shoulder area of Wade. That was all just custom one-off work.”But the entire conceit of these two elemental characters was an innovation that required a combination of realism and stylization (emphasizing energy over anatomy) with the help of new tools for rigging and performance. Ember’s flames operated like a gas range and were self-illuminating. Wade was more complicated because of reflection and refraction and required special attention to control the water and not obscure his face.Yet they couldn’t have pulled off Ember without the help of an AI program called volumetric Neural Style Transfer (NST), which allowed them to sculpt the fire simulation into something more stylized. “So it will take this raw fire simulation and organize the flames into these more illustrative shapes using target styles,” added Bakshi. “That is a technique we used on every fire character and on every shot of Ember. There were no other options to be this illustrative and beautiful.”However, the sequence in the underwater garden perfectly sets up the romantic mood for the touch. Wade sneaks Ember into the forbidden paradise with a protective water bubble so she can see her favorite flower, the Vivisteria, up close for the first time. The opulent yellow and violet flower was designed by director Sohn (named in honor of his daughter Vivian) to resemble an unfolding origami and was animated as a cloth simulation.“As the flowers are exposed to Ember’s light, they are able to unravel and bloom,” Bakshi said. “They look a little bit iridescent and have the hint of a beautiful particle trail. Then, as the vines go over the water bubble, it looks like they’re going through a car wash with a windshield wiper effect. That was really challenging because they’re hitting the bubble and folding as they sweep along, and the bubble reacts to them.“That was something, like a lot of the movie, that we just had words to describe what we wanted to happen,” he added. “No real visuals, but all in people’s imaginations.”",

        "content": "Jennifer Lawrence is coming clean about an on-set fear: Dealing with Method actors.The Oscar winner revealed during YouTube series “Hot Ones” that she would be “nervous” to work with a Method actor.“I would be scared to work with somebody who’s Method because I would have no idea how to talk to them. Like, do I have to be in character?” Lawrence said. “That would just make me nervous. But I haven’t seen another process that I’ve been curious about, because you don’t really know about them all the time.”Lawrence reflected on working with known Method actor Christian Bale on David O. Russell’s “American Hustle” and adjusting her own approach to acting.“I had always been very on/off, on/off until I did ‘American Hustle’ when I worked with Christian Bale and I noticed when the camera started rolling and the crew kind of started preparing, like it was going to be 10 seconds or whatever until action, he would start getting ready,” Lawrence recalled. “And then I saw that and I was like, ‘That seems like a really good idea.’ And then I started to do that.”The “No Hard Feelings” actress recently opened up about setting aside her desire for directing during this current state of her career. Lawrence was formerly attached to direct “Project Delirium” in 2015, based on the 2012 New Yorker article “Operation Delirium” about military doctors running experiments on soldiers during the Cold War. “You know, I used to think that [I wanted to direct], and now I’m just so tired,” Lawrence said. “And it just looks so hard.”She added, “There is just once you start your family, it’s the greatest thing in the world. I’m just going to try to take in every second and be present and enjoy it.”",

        "title": "‘The Perfect Find’ Review: Gabrielle Union Is Pure Charisma in an Unexpected Ode to Black Cinema History",
        "content": "“The Perfect Find” just might be one of the most perfect rom-coms of this year. Gabrielle Union (who also produces the feature) leads the Netflix film, which shines thanks to a smart script by Leigh Davenport (“Run the World”) adapted from Tia Williams’ novel of the same name. “The Perfect Find” channels the classic 2000s plotline of the fashion magazine as world’s most glamorous workplace, while also attempting an homage to Black cinema’s rich history.In the Numa Perrier-directed feature, Union plays famous fashionista Jenna Jones, who returns to New York City one year after her high-profile split from her mogul boyfriend of 10 years. Jenna lands a job as the creative director of her former nemesis Darcy’s (Gina Torres) fashion subscription service. Despite the vagueness over what the company actually does, Jenna quickly excels in her role, thanks in part to her chemistry with videographer Eric (Keith Powers), who she briefly encountered at a swanky hotel prior to realizing he was a coworker….and Darcy’s son.“The Perfect Find” has dashes of the Uma Thuman-Meryl Streep two-hander “Prime” as well as “13 Going on 30,” with the reminder that Jenna is newly 40 and, at least according to her ex, is going through a midlife crisis of self-discovery on her own. Good thing Eric is there as a Gen Z guiding light, not only for Jenna to find her business footing again but also remind her there such things as good, sensitive men in the world.Powers and Union’s chemistry and quippy dialogue back and forth grounds this sweet rom-com, reminding viewers what’s so fun about the early 2000s peak of the genre. “I slipped making out with a fetus!,” Jenna cries after kissing then-stranger Eric at the hotel’s bar, while her friends (played by Aisha Hinds and Alani “La La” Anthony) remind Jenna that they are her “voices for the vagina” to regain her mojo.Upon realizing that Eric is, in fact, Darcy’s son and her new colleague, Jenna sarcastically jokes that there is “nothing wrong with Black nepotism” despite Eric’s clear path to working at his mother’s media company. “We do our jobs, not each other!” Jenna post-coitally teases Eric. The film also packs in a slight enemies-to-lovers trope, as Eric and Jenna at first despise each other in the workplace due to their generational differences but also because they both are stubborn, headstrong, and wildly attracted to each other in a tense office setting.“The Perfect Find” further finds its muse in Jenna’s shelved aspiration to be a film historian, a passion that she incorporates into the latest campaign for the fashion conglomerate. The film itself is a celebration of Black fashion and cinema as a whole, with loving references to everything from the clichés of Tyler Perry movies to an ode to the legacy of actress Nina Mae, who was deemed the “Black Greta Garbo.”Despite its many charms, the film fumbles a bit in its ending, leaning into yet another kind of cliché but ultimately finding grace in righting wrongs of the past for both characters. Director Perrier (“Jezebel,” “Unprisoned”) has helmed a standout rom-com, bolstered by Union’s vision as a producer and lead star. The perfect find for those seeking a smart, sexy rom-com respite? Pretty close.“The Perfect Find” starts streaming on Netflix on Friday, June 23.",

        "content": "There’s no such thing as dumb luck when it comes to good money.“Dumb Money” is based on Ben Mezrich’s “The Antisocial Network” book, charting the 2021 GameStop short squeeze that changed Wall Street forever.

Craig Gillespie (“I, Tonya,” “Pam and Tommy”) directs the feature adaptation, which stars Seth Rogen, Sebastian Stan, Pete Davidson, Paul Dano, Vincent D’Onofrio, Dane DeHaan, Shailene Woodley, and Anthony Ramos.“The Batman” alum Dano stars as real-life YouTuber Keith Gill. Rogen, meanwhile, portrays the head of investment firm Melvin Capital, Gabe Plotkin, who tries to figure out the reason behind his big financial loss.Rogen told Vanity Fair that the stock market is “purposely convoluted” since it is “designed to keep people out of it.” The fascinating true story behind “Dumb Money” essentially democratized the stock market for the average American.“The price of entry is understanding this completely bizarre system. It’s so hard! Could you explain to me, conceptually, what shorting of stock is and why that is a thing that exists?” Rogen said. “I still have a hard time wrapping my head around it.

        "content": "Samuel L. Jackson knows his legacy will last forever, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he wants his image to be used “in perpetuity.”The iconic film star, who most recently appears in Disney+ Marvel series “Secret Invasion,” revealed his apprehension about the use artificial intelligence in Hollywood in a recent interview with Rolling Stone.“People just started worrying about that? I asked about that a long time ago,” Jackson said while discussing being “scanned,” a common practice for Marvel actors. “The first time I got scanned for George Lucas, I was like, ‘What’s this for?'”Jackson continued, “George and I are good friends, so we kind of had a laugh about it because I thought he was doing it because he had all those old guys in ‘Episode I,’ and if something happened to them, he still wanted to put them in the movie.”The “Avengers” star noted that the MCU has similarly followed suit when it comes to protecting the brand.“Ever since I’ve been in the Marvel Universe, every time you change costumes in a Marvel movie, they scan you,” Jackson said. “Ever since I did ‘Captain Marvel,’ and they did the Lola project where they de-aged me and everything else, it’s like, ‘Well, I guess they can do this anytime they want to do it if they really want to.'”Yet Jackson admitted that A.I. “could be something to worry about” for actors, saying, “Future actors should do what I always do when I get a contract, and it has the words ‘in perpetuity’ and ‘known and unknown’ on it: I cross that shit out. It’s my way of saying, ‘No, I do not approve of this.'”Tom Hanks also recently shared his thoughts about de-aging and A.I. technology as a way of keeping actors alive in movies forever.“I can tell you that there [are] discussions going on in all of the guilds, all of the agencies, and all of the legal firms in order to come up with the legal ramifications of my face and my voice — and everybody else’s — being our intellectual property,” Hanks said.The Oscar winner continued, “What is a bona fide possibility right now, if I wanted to, I could get together and pitch a series of seven movies that would star me in them in which I would be 32 years old from now until kingdom come. Anybody can now recreate themselves at any age they are, by way of A.I. or deep fake technology…I could be hit by a bus tomorrow and that’s it, but my performances can go on and on and on. Outside of the understanding that it’s been done by A.I. or deep fake, there’ll be nothing to tell you that it’s not me and me alone, and it’s going to have some degree of lifelike quality.”",

        "title": "‘The Beanie Bubble’ Trailer: Elizabeth Banks and Zach Galifianakis Revolutionize the Toy Industry",
        "content": "Remember when Beanie Babies broke the Internet? Well, the iconic toy is now landing its own biopic for audiences to see what it truly takes to build a plush stuffed animal from scratch.Apple’s “The Beanie Bubble” charts the rise and fall of the ingenious collectible stuffed animals, with Elizabeth Banks and Zach Galifianakis playing the real-life toy titans who invented the craze. In a twist of nostalgic toy-driven fate, “The Beanie Bubble” opens in select theaters the same weekend as “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.”Per the official synopsis, why did the world suddenly treat stuffed animals like gold? Ty Warner (Galifianakis) was a frustrated toy salesman until his collaboration with three women grew his masterstroke of an idea into the biggest toy craze in history.“Succession” star Sarah Snook portrays Warner’s wife (and one third of the love triangle alongside Banks) while “Blockers” breakout Geraldine Viswanathan is a Warner employee who predicts the bubble bursting.“The Beanie Bubble” is co-directed by real-life married duo Kristin Gore and Damian Kulash, the lead singer of OK Go. Gore wrote the film after writing stints on “Futurama,” “The Oscars,” and co-penning 2014 film “War Story” with director Mark Jackson. “The Beanie Bubble” is Gore’s directorial debut.“The Beanie Bubble” is produced by Imagine Entertainment’s Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, and Karen Lunder and executive produced by lead star Galifianakis and Douglas S. Jones.This marks Galifianakis’ first live-action film appearance since 2019 indie film “The Sunlit Night.” The comedic actor is set to voice Jumba in Disney’s “Lilo & Stitch” and is confirmed to star in Susanna Fogel’s “Winner” based on the true story of NSA whistleblower Reality Winner, with Emilia Jones portraying the veteran. Tina Satter’s recent HBO film “Reality” with Sydney Sweeney used the real-life transcripts from Winner’s arrest.Meanwhile, Galifianakis’ “Beanie Bubble” co-star Banks is in pre-production on animated “Flinstones” reboot “Bedrock,” voicing Pebbles. Banks additionally will lead Alex Prager’s A.I. thriller “DreamQuil” opposite John C. Reilly.“The Beanie Bubble” will premiere in select theaters on July 21 and globally on Apple TV+ on July 28.

        "title": "After ‘Barbie,’ Where’s the Barbie Doll? Why Theaters Aren’t Selling More Movie Merch",
        "content": "Banksy documentary “Exit Through the Gift Shop” sounds like a great business strategy for movie theaters still emerging from the pandemic. Do the captive-audience math: “The Little Mermaid” + two kids under six > one father who would never hear the end of it.However, it turns out that there are forces even greater than children begging for a Barbie doll in a gold disco jumpsuit (pictured above) for $50: among them, logistics and licensing.Exhibitors are well aware of the need for brand and use-case extensions. During COVID, theater owners turned their expensive screens toward gaming and private screenings. Once movies returned so did, um, AMC-branded popcorn. It’s now available at your local Wal-Mart, but you know another highly trafficked retailer with shelf space and cash registers? Movie theaters.IndieWire brought that question to major players: Why not sell movie merch in movie theaters? Genius, right? We thought so, too. However, the industry is divided.Amid the post-pandemic recovery, lobbies are getting facelifts and updated merchandise flows. A Cinemark rep told IndieWire that most of its 317 U.S. locations have at least some movie-specific items for purchase.AMC, the market leader with almost twice as many locations as Cinemark, is slow-playing the concept. It is, after all, harder to turn around an ocean liner than it is a Bayliner. While happy to push film-specific ways to enjoy your refreshments (ever want to eat popcorn out of Dom Toretto’s car?), AMC’s “collective concessions” have, to this point, generally been limited to snack-stand upsells. A wider range of officially licensed movie merch is available at AMC’s website.“As a result of our success through in-theatre and online sales of AMC’s popular collectable concession vessels, we believe further opportunity exists in strategic in-theatre merchandise sales,” an AMC spokesperson told IndieWire. “While we are not yet ready to share our plans in this area, we are excited about continuing to offer AMC moviegoers unique and special items connected to their favorite new releases.”Cinemark, which launched its own merchandise website last month, is more talkative on various in-lobby opportunities. Chief marketing and content officer Wanda Gierhart Fearing told IndieWire that she wants her theater lobbies to match the “experience economy” we currently share. “We’re an industry of creating memories,” she said.And nothing punctuates an experiential memory like a souvenir. A proper gift shop, one complete with toys, hoodies, figurines, posters, and collectibles, sounds to us like a better use of space in 2023 than dusty arcade games. (Gierhart Fearing said those quarter-collecting cabinets “still work” from a revenue standpoint: “Otherwise we wouldn’t have them.”)Cinemark has seen some success with what it calls its “Super Ticket” program. For $50, a Super Ticket got a Cinemark customer into a 3-D “Super Mario Bros. Movie” showing on their biggest screen, with a Mario t-shirt, hat, buttons, popcorn tub, and mini movie poster handed out at the theater. For “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” a $45 Super Ticket included a showtime with popcorn and a redemption code that sent a branded mini-poster, t-shirt, and digital soundtrack directly to the customer’s home.A Cinemark rep stressed for this story that the company’s primary objective remains maximizing attendance and box office. They’re happy to find ancillary revenue opportunities after that, is how the spokesperson put it.There are lots of obstacles to a movie theater going any deeper into the merch game. First, you’d need additional staff — the kind trained in loss prevention. And while the redesigned Cinemark lobbies (pictured above) look beautiful and have some storage built into the new displays for inventory, it’s not nearly enough to go all Build-A-Bear.And that’s not nearly the only logistical issue here. Gierhart Fearing, who has 30 years of retail experience ranging from selling furniture to dresses and travel accessories, said the challenge is, as she put it: “How do we think through a whole year of moviegoing?”Still, no one bats 1.000 on supply-and-demand forecasts, and the shipping costs associated with returning unsold merchandise to the manufacturer can be enormous, said one exhibition executive who spoke with IndieWire on the condition of anonymity.Any business model would rely on studio cooperation. According to one source familiar with the retail space, companies like Disney and others have launched pop-up shops or kiosks that offer movie-specific collectible items like a Funko Pop! toy. The source said these did “fine,” but such promos were just that — promotions — and always done on a small scale.Also small is the theater’s piece of the overall pie: You buy the product from the theater, who buys it from the manufacturer, who licenses the I.P. from the studio, one person with knowledge of the economics told IndieWire.Like the flow of films and box-office ticket sales, COVID killed the kiosks, though the concept of retail sales in movie theaters existed way before COVID.The idea isn’t new: Nearly 50 years ago, a company called National Screen Service planned to sell buttons, posters, pins, t-shirts, masks, and even fake vampire teeth and photon toy guns ahead of movies like “Superman,” “Dracula,” “Star Trek,” and “The Lord of the Rings.”“Why sell ‘Superman’ shirts at Sears or (JC) Penney’s?” a National Screen Service executive said to the New York Times back in 1978. “Why not turn the theater into a store since the people who want to buy the merchandise are the people who see the film?”Where that company failed, so did others. Landmark and the now-defunct Arclight also tried gift shops where they sold DVDs, t-shirts, books, and other gewgaws before the shops shrank to almost nothing. Some still exist in select markets: Alamo Drafthouses sell DVDs (the chain’s owner also owns a DVD company) and other vintage movie items, and they are offering a pink Barbie lunchbox and Thermos with the purchase of a “Barbie” movie ticket.“Retail does not sell in movie theaters,” the exhibition executive said, adding that it hasn’t worked whether you’re in Los Angeles or in St. Louis. “We have tried everything.”There may be a way for exhibitors to grow their retail-sales revenues via e-commerce even beyond their own websites.Movie-screen advertising companies NCM and Screenvision, which program those ads ahead of a feature presentation’s trailers, are toying with the concept of a “shoppable screen.” Soon, on-screen advertisements may feature a scannable QR code where one can buy a movie-related product and have it shipped directly to the house. NCM chief revenue officer Mike Rosen told IndieWire it’s an “untapped” opportunity that could conceivably mature to a delivery system that allowed for the pickup of certain items at the concession stand.The CEO of Rosen’s chief competitor, John Partilla of Screenvision, is hot on NCM’s heels with a similar plan. “You’ll see more” of those on-screen codes leading directly to making an online purchase, he said. Even though Screenvision and NCM would not get a piece of any in-lobby retail — unless it was its proprietary technology that made the point-of-purchase possible — Partilla thinks it’s a good idea.“You would think that when there’s the big Q4 movies like ‘Star Wars’ and things like that, they should have merch out there,” Partilla said. “But we haven’t convinced movie theaters to do it yet. We have looked at partnering with companies like (online retailer) Fanatics… but we’re not there yet.”And not getting a taste is “OK,” Partilla said. “We always root for the movie theaters. Anything that helps them increase their revenues is a good thing in the game.”",

        "content": "After all the furor over the layoffs of Turner Classic Movies‘ top brass, which saw the ousting of longtime executives who’d been key to steering the brand to the level of adoration its fans feel for it, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, and Paul Thomas Anderson are here to sound a moderating note.In a joint statement released via Spielberg’s production company, Amblin, the three directors go out of their way to praise Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav.“Turner Classic Movies has always been more than just a channel,” the statement reads. “It is truly a precious resource of cinema, open 24 hours a day seven days a week. And while it has never been a financial juggernaut, it has always been a profitable endeavor since its inception.“Earlier this week, David Zaslav, the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, got in touch to talk about the restructuring of TCM. We understand the pressures and realities of a corporation as large as WBD, of which TCM is one moving part.“We have each spent time talking to David, separately and together, and it’s clear that TCM and classic cinema are very important to him.  Our primary aim is to ensure that TCM’s programming is untouched and protected.“We are heartened and encouraged by the conversations we’ve had thus far, and we are committed to working together to ensure the continuation of this cultural touchstone that we all treasure.”As to what that could mean — bigger plans for the brand that involve the directors? — what’s at stake is more than TCM’s survival. TCM was shaped into what it is because of the passionate cinephiles in executive roles. A brand is powered by the people who work at it day to day. What follows will be, at the very least, a different TCM.One thinks of what writer and film journalist Mark Harris wrote on Twitter earlier today: “David Zaslav may answer this by saying, ‘But we’re not folding TCM.’ But TCM isn’t just a library, it’s a small, intense, and exceptional talent pool. It isn’t defined simply by its content, but by the people who curate and nurture it. That is true of all great culture brands.”",

        "title": "Rachel Sennott on Pushing for ‘Bottoms’ Fight Scenes: ‘Girls Deserve to Beat Each Other Up’",
        "content": "Within the first few minutes of “Bottoms,” the raucous teen comedy from “Shiva Baby” team Emma Seligman and Rachel Sennott, it’s clear this ain’t your average high school movie. The movies follows a pair of queer high school BFFs (played by Sennott and “The Bear” breakout Ayo Edebiri) who start a fight club at school in order to pick up chicks. It’s a straightforward premise, executed flawlessly, for a delightfully over-the-top queer teen comedy. With a late August release date in hand (just in time for back to school!), “Bottoms” could be the big hit of the late summer.Sennott and Seligman wrote the script together, with Seligman directing and Sennott starring. Although they were a hot creative team riding on the success of runaway indie hit “Shiva Baby,” the duo said during a recent panel that they faced plenty of pushback for the violence, action, and hilariously mean characters in “Bottoms.”“They were like, ‘ground it, ground it,'” Sennott said of early notes they received. “Sometimes in movies from women or queer people, [the characters] need to be so good, and we wanted them to be nasty little shits. And they still are friends, so we wanted to really strike that balance, but we felt like we got good notes and were able to tow the line.”Sennott and Seligman were on hand to speak to a thrilled audience after a raucous screening at the Provincetown International Film Festival this weekend, where Jordan Firstman opened his questioning with: “What motivates you more, blood or pussy?”Blood ended up being a pivotal part of the movie’s shock comedy, with an epic final fight scene leaving an array of dead bodies during a wild twist on the classic “big game” high school trope. The scene played like gangbusters in the packed theater, eliciting stunned cries and mouth-covering laughter.“It’s cool to see how people respond to the fighting. ‘Scott Pilgrim’ was a reference on the action side,” Sennott said. “When we first announced the movie we were like: It’s a fight club movie. And they put it in quotations, like, and the girls start a ‘fight club’ where they ‘fight.’ And we were like, no, it’s actual fighting. So it’s nice, girls deserve to beat each other up. I just love hearing everyone engage in the action.”Seligman added that, once on set, there were still some doubters who didn’t fully grasp the intensity of the violence in the movie. “Even when we were shooting it, some of the crew members and some key people on the team were like: ‘Wait, do we really need a stunt coordinator though?’ We‘d written in the script: ‘Hazel punches him, he throws her to the ground,'” she said.But thankfully, they found producers who not only understood the humor, but encouraged them to take it further. Orion Pictures executive Alana Mayo was instrumental in supporting the duo to stay true to their nasty, disruptive vision.“No one else wanted it but Orion, which has been around for awhile but has recently been revitalized with this amazing group of young women who completely understood it,” said Seligman. “Alana Mayo, if anything she pushed us to go further with the campiness and the absurdity. But I think there was a lot of hesitancy from the overall industry in terms of who the script was being sent out to.”“I remember getting some notes that were like, so the girls shouldn’t be mean, and we were like that’s the whole point,” said Sennott. “A lot of people were scared for the Gen Z audience, they’re like: ‘We don’t find it offensive, but the younger generation is so sensitive.’ We think we deserve to laugh and have fun like this, and everyone deserves to have a character that’s shitty and bad but funny and whatever.”MGM will release “Bottoms” in theaters on Friday, August 25.",

        "title": "‘Loren and Rose’ Review: Jacqueline Bisset Still Shines in Aimless, Entitled Ode to Aging Starlets",
        "content": "There’s no doubt that Jacqueline Bisset is a screen icon, but do we really need yet another meta commentary on the pitfalls of Hollywood with a lauded star as its only anchor? Bisset stars in “Loren and Rose,” written and directed by Russell Brown, and hitting select theaters after an extended tour of regional American film festivals. The drama follows aging starlet Rose (Bisset) who is looking to revive her career and takes multiple meetings with up-and-coming filmmaker Loren (Kelly Blatz) as he is casting his big break feature.Within a few minutes of extreme exposition, Loren narrates that Rose’s most iconic role was playing a white nun who falls in love with a Black priest. Yet, Rose is best known to the public for playing the lead in pulpy sci-fi franchise “Mega Gators Mom.” Rose’s celebrity status, no matter which film of hers you love best, has been dimmed after a humiliating public divorce and failed custody battle over her daughter, which made the tabloids go wild. (Again, we are told this, and have no glimpse into Rose during this era.)Then she joined a cult whose leader was arrested for embezzlement. Then Rose self-published a “manifesto” about the treatment of aging actresses in Hollywood who were deemed “difficult” and “unpredictable” after being out-spoken. And then her path finally crosses with Loren, whose autobiographical short film about his mother dying sets up the crux of the dynamic with Rose after they meet for a series of meals to chat about working together.“Loren and Rose” is itself paced as something akin to a three-course dinner, starting with a cutesy title card for an appetizer, or essentially how Rose’s charisma whets the palate of Loren’s intrigue. “Loren and Rose” is “My Dinner with André” by way of “Love’s Kitchen” and is shot like a TV movie, with a script on par with its lacking production design.Bisset’s own star power is impossible to shake even as she spews nonsense like, “Duck is the one animal I can’t eat, because I made a film with one. He was the most gentle co-star.” Rose imparts wisdom upon Loren, warning him that he is “too young to be jaded” when it comes to love — and even his career. Bisset shares her signature charm onscreen, which sadly is wasted in a lackluster film that seems destined to keep its audience wondering, “What is the point?”“Loren and Rose” spends its entirety bemoaning how much better cinema used to be, in the era of Truffaut and Wilde. There is no “Sunset Boulevard”-esque revelation by Rose or anger toward her lot in life. There’s not even a deeper truth shared about the treatment of women in a predatory and imbalanced industry. Instead, Rose is perfectly fine just slipping away into the enigma of her own celebrity, and by the end, we’re left wondering if Loren — or us — even really knew her at all.“It’s what made her great,” Loren narrates, “but it’s what also made her a mystery.” The real mystery? Why this film was made in the first place, even with the brightest of stars on hand to help guide it.“Loren and Rose” will be released in select theaters on Friday, June 23 in New York, Arizona, and Louisiana. Outside of these states, for a one-week period, viewers can purchase passes to stream the film at lorenandrose.com.",

        "title": "Death to ‘El Muerto’? Sony’s Bad Bunny Marvel Adaptation Faces Challenges Beyond the Strike",
        "content": "Sony has removed “El Muerto,” a Marvel movie about a luchador supervillain starring Bad Bunny, from its theatrical-release calendar. The “Spider-Man” baddie’s standalone film was previously scheduled for January 12, 2024; now, per Sony, it’s “TBD.”An individual with knowledge of the project told IndieWire that “El Muerto” is still in development, but with the writers strike ongoing and the musician’s tour dates, rescheduling the release is complicated. “El Muerto” isn’t the first superhero movie to be impacted by the WGA strike, but there are enough challenges here to wonder if “El Muerto” will be re-slotted, or if it’s down for the count.This morning, Sony emailed press with three updates to its domestic release calendar:There were multi-paragraph descriptions for both “Dumb Money” and “The Book of Clarence.” There was no synopsis at all for “El Muerto.”“El Muerto,” first announced by Bad Bunny himself at CinemaCon 2022, was meant to begin shooting in Los Angeles in August 2023. But since the initial announcement, there have been no additional (public) castings or significant updates. And in terms of that whole tour thing, Bad Bunny does not currently have any dates announced. Of course, that could change soon — the Latin superstar headlined Coachella this spring and released a new track last month.One movie producer (not affiliated with “El Muerto”) told IndieWire that it’s not time for Bad Bunny fans to freak out — not yet. After all, it would not be uncommon for even a short delay — let alone one like the writers strike that has no end in sight — to derail a production for quite a while.“I wouldn’t necessarily write it off just because they changed the release date. It’s certainly possible, and the industry has a glut of content right now and is in a dramatic state,” the producer, who spoke with us on the condition of anonymity, said. “But if your production is being delayed because of the writers strike, that’s delaying the window, and you’re losing Bad Bunny, I can easily see the thing where ‘We’re going to lose a month on this, and the way the schedule lines up, we need to lose six months or a year.'”In other words, today’s news does not make “El Muerto,” well, muerto. Sony surely wants to keep Bad Bunny close; he figured heavily into the marketing for their Brad Pitt action movie “Bullet Train” last summer. And Bad Bunny has put in time learning the ropes of pro wrestling — he faced Damien Priest at WWE premium live event “Backlash” in May.“El Muerto” is set to be directed by Jonás Cuarón (Alfonso’s son) and written by Garrett Dunnet-Alcocer, who wrote this summer’s upcoming “Blue Beetle.” That DC film is the first superhero movie to have a Latino lead, and the producer speculates Sony could also be looking at the performance of that film to determine next steps.As the producer said, “superhero fatigue is real,” and the El Muerto character, who appeared as a villain in just two Spider-Man comics back in the 2000s, is obscure even for the biggest comic nerds. This year has already saw the underperformance of superhero tentpoles like “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” “Shazam! Fury of the Gods,” and this past weekend’s “The Flash,” which opened to only $55 million domestic.On the bright side for “El Muerto,” the exception to the trend has been anything “Spider-Man” adjacent. Sony’s wildly lauded “Spider-Verse” sequel currently seems bulletproof, having grossed nearly $500 million globally since opening early in June. Sony is also doubling down hard on its own universe of Spider-Man villain spinoff characters, with a new “Venom” movie in the works and “Madame Web” starring Dakota Johnson still on track for 2024. Reaction to Sony’s R-rated “Kraven the Hunter,” which just debuted a first trailer, has also been strong.“There’s still novelty and freshness that can be brought to the genre, but I sense we may be hitting a saturation point,” the producer said. “There are signals we’re seeing that maybe people are ready to move on and see something different.”",

        "title": "‘Last of Us’ Showrunner Craig Mazin Is Now a Credited Writer on ‘Dune: Part Two’ Thanks to a New WGA Policy",
        "content": "Craig Mazin has not seen the last of his film screenwriting career.The “Last of Us” co-showrunner revealed during the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast that “Dune: Part Two” writer-director Denis Villeneuve reached out to Mazin to spend a month assisting on the script for the sequel starring Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Austin Butler, and Florence Pugh.Mazin noted that Villeneuve personally called him since Mazin is “out of the movie business” almost entirely and focused on TV.“I’ll work with certain directors when they call because I love them and because they’re so brilliant,” Mazin said. “So if Denis Villeneuve calls, then absolutely. I’m there for three, four weeks — a month — to work on what you’re working on.”“Dune: Part Two” is co-written by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts, with Mazin now receiving a writing credit. The film follows Paul (Chalamet) as he seeks revenge for the murder of his father while trying to bring peace to Arrakis.Mazin noted that his work on the “Dune: Part Two” script is what would have previously been deemed “uncredited” in Hollywood. However, as of January 2022, the WGA announced that writers’ names would appear during a film’s end credits and on industry databases for work that “rendered WGA-covered writing services on theatrical features who do not receive writing credit,” as the official guild page stated.“You come in, you do a little work, and then you leave. It used to be that you couldn’t even say that,” Mazin said. “But now they have this additional literary material [credit].”Mazin previously wrote HBO limited series “Chernobyl,” which starred “Dune” actor Stellan Skarsgård.“In television creatively, more than a lot of movies where the directors are important, screenwriters are important,” Mazin told IndieWire’s Anne Thompson in 2019.The showrunner also received admiration from Steven Spielberg, who sent a letter to the “Last of Us” team praising the series’ writing.“[An actual Spielberg letter] came to Craig Mazin, the writer of my episode on ‘The Last of Us’ — the writer of all the episodes,” director Peter Hoar said during a recent THR roundtable. “He shared it with myself, [actors] Nick Offerman, Murray Bartlett and [cinematographer] Eben Bolter. Basically, a whole group of middle-aged men started squealing because their idol had realized who they were.”",

        "title": "Disney Loves the Way You Bundle",
        "content": "The Disney Trio of streaming services is three, three, three times the fun for Disney — even if it’s not exactly three times the revenue for Disney.Disney’s Trio — Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu — runs $12.99 per month for the “Basic” plan (with ads) or $19.99 for the ad-free “Premium” plan. The combination provides a clear value to consumers: Trio Basic is a savings of 49 percent vs. subscribing to each service individually; without ads, it’s a 44 percent savings. (Disney is happy to give you a bigger break on subscription price in exchange for the advertising revenue; details on the options are here.)But where the bundle really pays off for Disney is in a subscriber’s loyalty. The Disney Bundle, a term generally reserved for the Trio (there is also a Duo of ad-supported Hulu and Disney+ for $9.99 that falls under the “Disney Bundle” banner), has the lowest churn (the amount of subscribers who cancel a service) in the entire streaming industry at just 2 percent, according to new Antenna data compiled by the analysts at technology, media, and telecom research firm MoffettNathanson.That’s better than Netflix’s 3.3 percent; the average industry churn has been steady around 6-7 percent. And 2 percent is twice as good as the standalone Disney+ rate (4 percent). Hulu’s standalone churn rate is 5 percent; the ESPN+ standalone churn is pretty bad, at just a bit north of 7 percent.Sixty million, or a hair more than half of Disney’s reported 119.8 million total domestic subscribers, come from the Trio, per MoffettNathanson. Not surprisingly, ESPN+ is the one that disproportionately benefits from the bundle: the service has just 5.3 million standalone subscribers, but checks off another 20 million thanks to the Trio.To Michael Nathanson and his team, there’s one clear conclusion from the data: “The best path forward is one Disney bundle that incorporates all the content from Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN+ in one app,” the Tuesday note, obtained by IndieWire, reads. They called it “a much better opportunity here than meets the eye.”While a Hulu tile is already (read: finally) on its way to Disney+, the analysts believe “ESPN’s sports content should also be integrated.” Why not? The numbers prove out that ESPN+ is disposable to too many users, but the three services-in-one approach is a keeper. So truly put them in one.The future of ESPN, the brand, has been debated for a few years now. The linear network is a money-printing factory, but cord-cutting and the struggling advertising market has your single priciest cable channel in flux. Calls for ESPN to go fully streaming as a standalone SVOD/AVOD hybrid service have been met with calls back of “Are you nuts?” Crazy like a fox (not a Fox, which kept its sports business away from the 2019 Disney acquisition — and has mostly kept away from streaming) if part of a broader Disney streamer, Nathanson told IndieWire.While it does seem like an inevitability that ESPN go entirely over-the-top, one shouldn’t slaughter a cash cow until it nears the end of its natural life. And forget content: these days, cash is king. While Hulu has been considered profitable for a while now, Disney+ is still looking at 2025 to meet that benchmark — hopefully.How bad is the current media landscape? In the same note as all this optimism, MoffettNathanson reduced its prior DIS target price (but kept its “outperform” rating) by $7 to $120. Disney stock closed Tuesday just south of $90 per share.",

        "title": "‘Asteroid City’ Has the Precise Camerawork of a Wes Anderson Film — but Now in Desert Sunlight",
        "content": "In Wes Anderson‘s “Asteroid City,” a group of scientists, military personnel, and “Junior Stargazer” science students gather at a giant meteor crater for a ceremony honoring the kids’ inventions, only to see the celebration take an unexpected turn when an alien arrives. Although the story takes place in 1955 and deals with science fiction elements and then-futuristic technology, the methods used to bring Anderson’s world to life are drawn from even farther back in cinema history. “It was kind of going back to what the early pioneers of film did,” cinematographer Robert Yeoman told IndieWire. “They built sets [out in the sunlight] and just put diffusion cloth on top.”For “Asteroid City,” this approach derived from the fact that Anderson wanted to use all natural light for the scenes in the desert town after which the movie is named. “I knew that inside locations like the diner would need light, so I just asked if we could put skylights in the diner and any building where we knew we were going to be shooting day interiors,” Yeoman said. “[Production designer] Adam Stockhausen put skylights in and we covered them with very soft diffusion material and it worked out beautifully. We never used any lights, and that was Wes’ dream.”Shooting in natural light was in keeping with Anderson’s simplified, lo-fi approach. “He likes to keep the set as small as possible,” Yeoman said. “I’ve worked on big studio movies where you look around and there are hundreds of people standing around and five video villages and it’s just a giant apparatus, but Wes likes to move fast and does not believe in any of that stuff. It’s often just him, myself operating, a focus puller, a second AC with a slate, a dolly grip and a boom guy, and that’s it. Wes has a little monitor that he holds and he sits next to the dolly, but he watches the actors. He just checks the monitor because if I’m making a move, he wants to see the move. In his dream world, he would have eight people making the entire movie.”Anderson’s desire to strip things down and focus on the actors informed Yeoman’s approach to another environment in “Asteroid City,” the milieu of 1950s live theater in which actors are ostensibly staging the alien story as a play within the movie. For these black-and-white, Elia Kazan-inspired sequences shot in the Academy ratio (as opposed to the sci-fi story’s color and widescreen), Yeoman and his camera department pre-lit everything so that when Anderson and his actors stepped on the set they “just flicked the lights on.”Looking to Francis Ford Coppola and Vittorio Storaro’s work on “One From the Heart” as an influence, Yeoman allowed himself to have fun with the New York theater world, creating expressionistic lighting changes within scenes that contrasted with the more straightforward natural light of the desert passages. “I love the idea of lights changing within a shot and coordinating those moves to the actors,” Yeoman said. “We do a lot of dimming, or a spotlight might come on someone, and it’s a very theatrical way of shooting.”Yeoman had far less control in the desert, and it was a constant challenge maintaining consistent light in the movie’s many day exteriors. “On other movies, I would be tempted to bring in some big lifts and put giant silks up to soften the light, but it was too windy out there in the desert,” Yeoman said. “It would’ve been dangerous. But also, Wes was really eager to embrace harsh sunlight. We looked at some movies together, like ‘Bad Day at Black Rock’ and ‘Paris, Texas,’ and they were not afraid to shoot at high noon so that the light becomes kind of a character in the film. We rarely used anything other than a bounce card to put some light in the actors’ eyes. It goes against all of my past as a cinematographer, where you always want to soften or shape the light in some way, but eventually, I embraced that approach.”Beyond the lighting, Yeoman was faced with his usual challenge on a Wes Anderson film: executing the director’s extremely complicated and precise camera moves, which have become increasingly ambitious. It’s not unusual in an Anderson movie for the camera to make several 90-degree pivots in a shot combined with dolly moves and swish pans, all of which have to be meticulously coordinated with the director’s penchant for deep-focus, symmetrical compositions.For Yeoman, the planning begins in pre-production, when he walks the location with a viewfinder to see if the shots in Anderson’s animatics are physically possible. In the case of “Asteroid City,” Stockhausen built an entire desert town in forced perspective on the outskirts of Chinchón in Spain, and the placement of buildings was slightly adjusted to make sure the actors and camera could get from one point to another in the time allotted by Anderson’s dialogue. “If the dialogue takes place in a minute, we need to make that shot within a minute, not a minute 10,” Yeoman said.During production, the camera moves are accomplished via a system created by key grip Sanjay Sami, with whom Yeoman has worked since “The Darjeeling Limited” in 2007. “He has dolly tracks that go back and forth and sideways that he can switch, like a train,” Yeoman said. “Those tracks have to be tightly controlled because it has to be down to the millimeter. There’s a small crosshair on the camera and Wes can see when you didn’t make it. When you land, it has to be very precise, and it’s so fast you couldn’t use a Steadicam or a Technocrane.” Adding to that is the complication of keeping everything in focus: “It’s very tricky because often Wes will have a character way in the foreground and someone way in the background, and he’ll want them both in focus. So it takes the three of us — Sanjay pushing the dolly, me operating, and Vincent [Scotet] on the focus — to do a really difficult move, and when we can achieve it, I get a great deal of satisfaction.”Yeoman also gets satisfaction from continuing to shoot on film. “I love digital cameras, don’t get me wrong,” he said. “But I think when you shoot film everyone is much more focused because they know there’s only a finite amount of film in the camera. When I shoot things digitally, often they just keep the camera rolling while the hair and makeup people come running in, and I feel like the attention gets diffused. With film, everyone pays attention more, and Wes likes that focus. This may sound weird, but I think somehow that energy finds its way onto the negative.”",

        "title": "Luc Besson Cleared of All Charges in Rape Case",
        "content": "Luc Besson has been cleared of all rape charges from a 2018 case involving actress Sand Van Roy.The “Léon, the Professional” director was accused of raping the Dutch-Belgian actress multiple times over the course of two years. The Van Roy case against Besson was dismissed in 2021 after an investigation, but the legal charges are now officially dropped by the highest court in France as of June 21, 2023.“This decision confirms the dismissal in favor of Luc Besson and confirms all the decisions of the last five years which have found him not guilty,” Besson’s attorney Thierry Marambert said in a statement to IndieWire. “It therefore puts a definitive end to this procedure initiated in 2018, during which Luc Besson was systematically cleared by all the magistrates who examined the case. As a lawyer, I welcome this exemplary procedure, which has allowed the manifestation of the truth which is that Luc Besson is innocent.”The Cour de Cassation, the country’s equivalent to the Supreme Court, formally dismissed all charges against Besson in the fourth and final judicial instruction for the case after first being dismissed in February 2019 following a nine-month investigation into Van Roy’s claims, citing a lack of evidence.The actress later filed a civil complaint on the same charges in March 2019, and it was dismissed again after a wide-spanning investigation in December 2021 and involved hearings with witnesses, including Besson’s ex-wife Maïwenn and his former partner Anne Parillaud. Besson shares a daughter with Maïwenn and two children with Parillaud.Van Roy appealed for a second time, with the case now being closed. The ruling from the Cour de Cassation clears Besson of all charges and prevents Van Roy from suing him on the same charges in France or elsewhere in Europe (Van Roy previously attempted to file a lawsuit in Belgium to no avail).Van Roy, who starred in Besson’s “Valerian,” alleged that she had an abusive relationship with the filmmaker; the actress accused Besson of raping her in a Paris hotel room on May 17, 2018. Since 2018, Besson has been accused of sexual assault by nine different women, including Van Roy, who is the only one to have filed charges.Besson and his attorney have “categorically denied all the accusations made against him” over the course of the last five years since the first assault claims were made public. Besson’s ex-wife Maïwenn, whose “Jeanne du Barry” recently opened the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, has further addressed the allegations against Besson.Maïwenn married Besson in 1992 when she was 16 years old. Besson first met Maïwenn when she was 12, and the couple began dating when the actress was 15. Maïwenn said during the 1994 DVD extras for controversial film “Léon, the Professional” that the film’s central relationship was inspired by her and Besson’s love story. The couple divorced in 1997.In February 2023, Maïwenn was accused of assaulting French journalist Edwy Plenel, who is the Mediapart magazine editor-in-chief, the publication which first published many of the accusations against Besson. Mediapart published Maïwenn’s testimony to police regarding the allegations against Besson; Maïwenn confirmed that she felt “morally violated” by the article.“I don’t blame Mediapart for their investigations into Luc Besson; I blame them for what they have done to me,” she said, citing the assault against Plenel. “There’s no justification for attacking a journalist, but there’s no justification for violating a woman’s intimacy and trust.”Per Maïwenn, the filmmaker and actress met with a Mediapart journalist in late 2018 for an off-the-record conversation regarding Besson. Maïwenn additionally testified during Van Roy’s investigation in June 2020 on the order of the court. In early 2021, Paris Match and Mediapart published excerpts from Maïwenn’s testimony without notifying her, despite Mediapart previously promising to give her 48 hours’ notice for the sake of her daughter with Besson. Maïwenn filed a civil suit against Paris Match and lost; she opted to not file a claim against Mediapart.Besson is set to produce upcoming action film “Weekend Escape Project” starring Luke Evans and Gwei Lun-mei, as also announced this week following the assault case being dismissed.",

        "content": "Jacob Elordi is just a hunk of burning love as Elvis Presley.The “Euphoria” breakout star transforms into the King of Rock ‘n Roll for Sofia Coppola‘s adaptation of Priscilla Presley’s 1985 memoir, “Elvis and Me.” Simply titled “Priscilla,” the A24 film stars Cailee Spaeny as the ex-wife of Elvis.“Priscilla” marks Coppola’s third film with A24 since her “On the Rocks” and “The Bling Ring.” The writer-director also reunites with collaborators like cinematographer Philippe Le Sourd, costume designer Stacey Battat, editor Sarah Flack, and production designer Tamara Deverell for the period piece.Coppola recently compared “Priscilla” to her 2006 film “Marie Antoinette,” calling Priscilla herself a “quintessential glamour icon” of Americana style. “I was just so interested in Priscilla’s story and her perspective on what it all felt like to grow up as a teenager in Graceland,” Coppola said. “She was going through all the stages of young womanhood in such an amplified world — kind of similarly to Marie Antoinette.”The director added that the feature is “a low-budget film” that will be entirely different from Baz Luhrmann’s Oscar-nominated musical biopic “Elvis” starring Austin Butler. “I think Baz is so unique and his take on that story was so creative. But Priscilla is such a minor character in that film so I never felt like I was treading on the same territory,” Coppola said. “I love that people were so into his film about Elvis, and now in a few years there’ll be another film about Priscilla. I think it’ll be interesting to have two completely different interpretations of the same events and time period.”Actor Elordi told Harper’s Bazaar Australia that filming “Priscilla” was “the experience of a lifetime” with Coppola. “I’ve never worked with anybody as calm as Sofia Coppola; as calm and as sure as she is in her personal style,” the “Kissing Booth” alum said. “She’s just an entirely beautiful human being — she’s the personification of how her set is. Everything ran smoothly, everything was beautiful, everything was organized, we never had a bad day on set. I just really hope we did the whole thing justice, but either way, it’s an experience that I’ll definitely cherish.”“Priscilla” premieres later this year in theaters.

        "title": "‘No Hard Feelings’ Review: Jennifer Lawrence’s Limp Teen Sex Comedy Falls Flat",
        "content": "If anyone could have saved the studio comedy, it might have been Jennifer Lawrence. But if the uneven sex comedy “No Hard Feelings” is Hollywood’s best effort, it’s not looking good for either one. Starring Lawrence as a broadly sketched caricature of an emotionally stunted, sexually liberated thirtysomething struggling to stay afloat, “No Hard Feelings” tries to resurrect the messy white woman trope that worked so well in films like “Young Adult” and “Trainwreck.” Though by no means a guarantee, there’s a crucial difference between those movies and “No Hard Feelings” — actual women wrote them.Though Lawrence, who is also an executive producer of the movie, is working overtime to make the stilted and over-the-top humor work, director Gene Stupnitsky (co-writing with John Phillips) seems far more interested in trying to invert conventional gendered comedy tropes. Lawrence dons skin-tight dresses soaked in water, takes a punch to the groin in a fully nude fight scene, and practically trips over herself to seduce a young nerd.It’s like “Never Been Kissed” crossed with “Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo.” While there are moments of committed physical comedy and a few good line deliveries, the circumstances are neither believable nor outrageous enough to add up.“No Hard Feelings” takes place in Montauk, a formerly middle-class Long Island beach town that has slowly been taken over by the moneyed elite. These shifting demographics are a source of constant stress and frustration for the diehard locals, like Maddie Barker (Lawrence), a bartender and Uber driver who is barely scraping by after the death of her mother. Though Maddie inherited her quaint childhood home on a desirable piece of property, she’s behind on property tax payments, which have tripled along with the town’s median income.The movie opens as local tow operator Gary (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), still hurt since Maddie ghosted him after three months of dating, comes to repossess her car. Prancing out of the house in a classic bathrobe and lingerie, her attempts to charm him are interrupted by a shirtless Italian man stretching on her lawn. As he feels her up from behind, she insists they’re just cousins. “You know how Italians are,” she pleads. The message is clear: Maddie is a player with no time for emotions.When she comes across an ad for a unusual gig to “date” a sheltered high schooler in exchange for a Buick, it seems the fastest way to get a car. “You know how these helicopter parents are,” says her schlubby surfer friend (Scott MacArthur). “They’ll do anything for their kids. I’m surprised they’re not gonna fuck him themselves.” (That the secondary male character gets some of the movie’s best lines reveals the writers’ allegiances.)Commuting by rollerblade since losing her car, Maddie arrives at the sloped driveway of the family’s sleek modern mansion huffing and puffing. As she ascends the stairs with an eager determination, the aforementioned helicopter parents (the underused Matthew Broderick and Laura Benanti) look on serenely. Mom and Dad don’t have distinct traits other than being rich and out of touch, which might have been avoided if they had more than two scenes — one in the beginning and one at the end.Once Maddie meets Percy (newcomer Andrew Barth Feldman), his meddling parents recede into the background, their presence only a faint reflection in the nervous son they’ve sheltered into helplessness. Attacking the kid with a feral intensity, Maddie takes a sexual approach to the assignment, misreading the tender virgin at every turn. After Maddie forces a ride home on the kid and snatches his phone away, he maces her in an attempt to avert his obvious kidnapping. But the shock of Percy hosing her down with her eyes glued shut doesn’t quite land, and neither does her naked beatdown of a group of clothing thieves on the beach.The ridiculous scenarios are obviously meant to be funny, but they mostly feel contrived and arrive out of the blue, with little build-up to sudden forced outrageous. Much like Maddie’s aggressive seduction of Percy, the movie bludgeons the viewer with its outlandish scenarios and awkwardly juvenile sex talk. Without being let in on her logic, Maddie decides that she must sleep with Percy in order to get the Buick, even though the initial pitch was just to get him out of his shell. “I promise I’ll put out,” Percy says, after he gets to know her better.As the lead of the movie, Lawrence is expected to do most of the heavy lifting, but she gets very little help from Barthe Feldman, who has interpreted Percy’s shyness and anxiety as being boring and lifeless. The script does him no favors with the thinly sketched character, but he makes no interesting physical choices to signal any sort of personality hiding behind the cautious teenager facade. But most galling is how utterly unmoved he seems by Maddie’s obvious charisma, hiding any glimpse of pent up desire he might be harboring, even if it is just for conversation.The most incisive humor is directed towards kids Percy’s age, who are all on their phones at a party Maddie crashes, where she gets called ma’am and is kicked out after making what is basically a no homo joke. While it’s funny to watch even the youthful Lawrence deal with ageism, the focus on her age begs the question of who the movie is for.Percy isn’t a full enough character to draw in younger crowds, which means it’s for people Lawrence’s age who…want to hang out with teenagers? As with most inverted Hollywood tropes, merely switching the genders to put dude humor into a woman character will always ring false. Much like Percy’s performance anxiety, it just falls flat.Sony Pictures will release “No Hard Feelings” in theaters on Friday, June 23.",

        "title": "The 20 Best Tom Hanks Movies, from ‘Cast Away’ to ‘Toy Story’ to ‘Big’",
        "content": "Take a gander at the last 40 years of cinema, and you’ll find at least one universal truth: The people love Tom Hanks.The 66-year-old actor is known around Hollywood and the world as an affable everyman, with as much capacity for heady drama as he has a knack for quippy comedy. Hanks’ most famous roles range from the light and whimsical (see flicks like “Money Pit,” “Turner & Hooch,” and “Larry Crowne”) to the darkly complex (“The Green Mile,” “Charlie Wilson’s War,” and “The Post”). He’s also responsible for delivering lines in some of cinema’s most quotable movies, including “A League of Their Own” (“There’s no crying in baseball!”) and “Apollo 13” (“Houston, we have a problem”).Hanks cut his teeth as a stage actor, performing Shakespeare and other plays in his hometown of Lakewood, California for much of the late ’70s. At 24-years-old, Hanks made his first movie appearance as a flirty jogger in the slasher “He Knows You’re Alone” before starring opposite Daryl Hannah in Ron Howard’s romantic comedy “Splash” four years later (which ranks at No. 3 on IndieWire’s guide to the best mermaid movies).Hanks was known for his rom-coms for some time, famously pairing up with Meg Ryan for both “Sleepless in Seattle” and “You’ve Got Mail.” His broader comedies were similarly well-received, with “Toy Story” becoming a franchise (to which Hanks’ voice remains essential) and “Big” snagging the actor his first Oscar nomination (for his performance as a 12-year-old trapped in an adult’s body).That said, the best Tom Hanks roles have largely been dramatic. “Philadelphia” would earn Hanks his first Academy Award for Best Actor in 1994. He’d immediately follow it up with a second Best Actor win for “Forrest Gump” in 1995. Teaming up with director Steven Spielberg for “Saving Private Ryan,” Hanks was nominated again in 1999. The actor topped off his turn of the century success streak with one more nomination for Robert Zemeckis’ 2000 survival epic “Cast Away.” Hanks wouldn’t be honored by the Academy again until 2020, when he played beloved children’s show host Mr. Rogers in “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.”In honor of Hanks’ recent stand-out turn in Wes Anderson’s “Asteroid City,” we’ve updated our list of his greatest performances, and expanded the entries to 20. Plus: A list of his characters’ best lines from those titles.Note: For the purpose of this ranking, the ‘Toy Story’ franchise has been regarded as a single body of work.Best line: “What is it you think we do here for a living, kid?”What sets it apart: Assuming you don’t count Hanks and wife Rita Wilson’s producing credits on the “Mamma Mia!” duology, Steven Spielberg’s “The Post” marks the actor’s only collaboration with Meryl Streep (so far). The two Hollywood heavyweights bring intense energy to what could be a tiresome journalism drama as newspaper publisher Katharine Graham and editor Ben Bradlee in the days leading up to the Washington Post’s decision to publish the Pentagon Papers. Hanks was not nominated for Best Actor at that year’s Oscars (though Streep enjoyed a Best Actress nod), but did have his work recognized at the Golden Globes among other awards shows. —AFBest line: “You know you’ve reached rock bottom when you’re told you have character flaws by a man who hanged his predecessor in a military coup.”What sets it apart: Hanks delivers a one-two, comedic-dramatic punch in the true story of “Charlie Wilson’s War”: the late director Mike Nichols’ brilliant telling of a congressman (Hanks) and CIA agent’s (Philip Seymour Hoffman) efforts to arm rebels during the Soviet–Afghan War in an underdog mission named Operation Cyclone. Written by Aaron Sorkin, the 2007 gem boasts Hanks at his most by-the-bar likeable. Despite the obviously sensitive subject, the well-loved dramedy’s redemption arc of a womanizing politician-turned-vehicle for good is entertaining start to finish with some all-time exchanges between Hanks and co-star Julia Roberts as socialite Joanne Herring. (“Why is Congress saying one thing and doing nothing?” “Well, tradition mostly.”) —AFBest line: “In my loneliness, I have learned to give complete and unquestioning faith in the people I love.” What sets it apart: As the grouchy father-in-law to Jason Schwartzman’s war photographer, Hanks is a standout in the rock-solid ensemble of Wes Anderson’s latest. The part plays with the actor’s “America’s dad” reputation in interesting ways, casting him as a loving grandfather but cold presence towards the man who married his now deceased daughter. Hanks’ understated and gruff presence fits the films muted but quietly devestating exploration like a glove, and the slow dethawing Stanley experiences towards his son-in-law makes for one of the movie’s most satisfying arcs. It’s a good enough performance that watching makes one wonder how Hanks hasn’t been in every Anderson movie already. —WC   Best line: “We need to get off this merry-go-round, sir. The next mistake our countries make could be the last one. We need to have the conversation our governments can’t.”What sets it apart: Ranking on IndieWire’s collection of the best spy movies ever made, “Bridge of Spies” sees Hanks take on the part of the real James B. Donovan: a Cold War-era attorney tasked with arranging the release of  U.S. pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) from a Moscow prison. Reuniting with director Steven Spielberg for the first time since “The Terminal” in 2004, the resultant display of espionage excellence used Hanks and his director’s most reliable talents to score six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Mark Rylance won Best Supporting Actor that year for his performance as Rudolf Abel, a Soviet spy. —AFBest line: “This has nothing to do with your business.”What sets it apart: Among the few fictional mob dads to really give Tony Soprano a run for his money, Hanks’ Michael Sullivan anchored the plodding terror of “Road to Perdition” with arresting gravitas. Sam Mendes’ 2002 revenge flick — his first film after “American Beauty” — follows a mob enforcer on his quest to avenge the death of his wife and child with his 12-year-old son in tow. Acting with Jude Law, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Craig, and even the late Paul Newman in his final major movie performance (Newman received a Best Supporting Actor nod for the effort), Hanks explores seemingly endless opportunities for chemistry with his castmates. He brings an especially strong performance out of the then just-starting-out Tyler Hoechlin as Michael Sullivan Jr. —AFBest line: “It was a million tiny little things that, when you added them all up, they meant we were supposed to be together.” What sets it apart: “Sleepless in Seattle” would be Hanks’ first collaboration with Meg Ryan, and the two eventually became an iconic rom-com duo. But Nora Ephron’s beloved film keeps the two apart for almost its entire runtime, with Ryan’s Annie falling in love with Hanks’ Sam after he hears him speaking about his grief over his dead wife on a national radio program. It’s hard to sell the soulmate connection that “Sleepless in Seattle” pushes, but the pair manage, conveying a deep chemistry when they finally come face to face that makes it obvious they’re meant to be. And beforehand, Hanks is perfect in the role of an average, kindhearted man navigating love in the wake of loss, anchoring his performance with the perfectly sweet relationship between Sam and his son Jonah (Ross Malinger). —WCBest line: “Things that happen in this world. It’s a wonder God allows it.”What sets it apart: Based on Stephen King’s 1996 novel of the same name, “The Green Mile” stars Hanks as a Depression-era prison guard working on death row at a Louisiana penitentiary, where he becomes convinced a Black man (Michael Clarke Duncan) accused of killing two white girls is not only innocent but possesses a supernatural ability to heal others. The religious parable that follows is a searingly ironic reflection on the tyranny of humanity that thoroughly — if somewhat clumsily — examines the faulty American justice system that so often fails those it should serve most. Though it won no Oscars, “The Green Mile’ earned nods for Best Picture, Best Sound, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor for Duncan’s performance as John Coffey. —AFBest line: “I don’t think anybody can grow unless he really is accepted exactly as he is.”What sets it apart: It’s a bit of casting that is almost too good; of course a celebrity as beloved as Hanks would get chosen to play Fred Rogers, maybe the most universally adored entertainer that isn’t a Muppet. But sometimes the obvious casting is the correct one, because Hanks is perfect as the “Mister Roger’s Neighborhood” star, imbuing him with a deep and moving kindness that never crosses the line into cartoonish or two-dimensional. It helps that Hanks is a supporting figure in the film, which focuses mostly on Matthew Rhys as the cynical journalist struggling with fatherhood who interviews him for a magazine piece. The two have crackerjack and moving chemistry together, as Hanks’ Rogers pushes the younger man into becoming a kinder, more openhearted person. —WCBest line: “The one-hit Wonders. A very common tale.”What sets it apart: Hanks’ directorial debut, “That Thing You Do!” also contains one of the stars’ most memorable supporting performances. He plays Mr. White: a talent manager fashioned loosely after The Beatles’ Brian Epstein who takes one-hit wonders the Oneders (pronounced “Wonders,” not “Oh-need-ers”) under his wing. The role is one of the first times he’s ever played a mentor figure, and from the jump it’s clear he was essentially born for it; he’s terrific as the sarcastic, sharp-tongued industry pro, whipping the dysfunctional small town band into shape. But the character has the sweetness inherent to some of Hanks best work, exemplified by his protectiveness of the band leader’s girlfriend Faye (Liv Tyler) and his encouragement of drummer Guy (Tom Everett Scott) to pursue her. —WCBest line: “Don’t cry, Shopgirl. Don’t cry.”What sets it apart: Hanks’ reteam with Ephron and Ryan after the success of “Sleepless in Seattle” isn’t quite as good as “The Shop Around the Corner,” which it’s loosely based on, but it comes pretty close. The extremely ’90s plotline casts Hanks against type as a cutthroat executive for a mega bookstore chain, who clashes with Ryan’s independent store owner. Online, however, they’re pen pals over AOL, and slowly start to fall in love with each other. Hanks and Ryan’s famous chemistry gets its best showcase here, as they defrost from hate to friendship to love, and Hanks’ arc of learning to be a kinder person makes for surprisingly meaty material in a sunny rom-com. —WC Best line: “Houston, we have a problem.” What sets it apart: Hanks has become something of a survival specialist over the years, playing a man lost at sea in “Cast Away” and a captain facing off with pirates in “Captain Phillips.” But before the actor took on either of those roles, he anchored director Ron Howard’s harrowing dramatization of the infamously dicey Apollo 13 mission as Commander Jim Lovell. Here Hanks offers a masterclass in remaining present, creating a taut dynamic with the ground crew while simultaneously keeping the astronauts suddenly stranded in space focused on their goal. This, of course, results in the all-time excellent “Houston, we have a problem” scene so many know so well. —AFBest line: “I don’t get it.” What sets it apart: From Jamie Lee Curtis in “Freaky Friday” to the cast of the recent “Jumanji” sequels, countless adult actors have tackled the challenge of playing children magically trapped in grown-up bodies. But Hanks set a new standard and earned his first Oscar nomination with Josh Baskin, the 13-year-old hero of “Big.” In this endlessly lovely coming-of-age romp, a frustrated kid gets his wish to “be big” from a mysterious boardwalk game. The adventure that follows lets Hanks parade through hilariously relatable fish-out-of-water scenes, including a serious “sleepover” misunderstanding with his co-worker/love interest Susan (Elizabeth Perkins). (“OK, but I get to be on top!”) “Big” also boasts Hanks’ unforgettable dancing scene atop a giant keyboard in iconic toy store FAO Schwarz. —AFBest line: “Is that the truth, Frank? Is that the truth?” What sets it apart: Audiences can thank director Steven Spielberg for casting Hanks and his outrageous Boston accent opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in this blistering cat-and-mouse saga. Based on the true story of reformed con man and forger Frank Abaganale, “Catch Me If You Can” features Hanks’ best police performance to date. As FBI Agent Carl Hanratty, Hanks needed to maintain the tension of the film’s titular pursuit while steadily building an emotional relationship between Carl and Frank almost entirely by phone. When the characters finally meet in the film’s last act, Hanks delivers one of the most dramatically rewarding scenes of his career. —AFBest line: “You are a child’s play thing!” What sets it apart: Voice actors were evolving their artform alongside technically-savvy animators long before the 1986 founding of Pixar. But Hanks brought something extra special to the revolutionary “Toy Story,” helping sell the toys-come-to-life premise with the timeless panache he brought to Sheriff Woody. From heartfelt moments (“We’ll always be there for him…”) to funnier beats (“That wasn’t flying. That was falling with style!”), Hanks delivered countless lines across the Toy Story films with earnest believability and cowboy flair that helped the still bustling, digitally rendered world feel real. —AFBest line: “There’s no crying in baseball.”What sets it apart: “A League of Their Own” stars Hanks as Jimmy Dugan, a jaded former baseball player who unexpectedly becomes coach for the all-women’s team The Rockford Peaches. Hanks is easy to love in comedic roles, of course. But what made his contribution to director Penny Marshall’s 1992 film a stand-out — particularly in an acting lineup that also boasts Geena Davis, Madonna, Garry Marshall, and more — was Jimmy’s sharp edge, which presented a snarky challenge uncharacteristic of Hanks’ other movie work to that point. A cynical alcoholic with  limited respect for the job he’s been given (at least initially), Jimmy was tough love personified, letting Hanks knock iconic lines (“The hard is what makes it great!”) out of the park. —AFBest line: “If going to Ramel and finding him so he can go home, if that earns me the right to get back to my wife, well, then, that’s my mission.” What sets it apart: War movies allow actors recreating the horrors of combat ample opportunities for star-making performances. But unlike some leading action heroes, Hanks didn’t use his part in “Saving Private Ryan” to deliver some look-at-me drama showcase. Instead, Hanks’ Oscar-nominated take on Captain John Miller is impactful because it is grounded in the tragic reality that many soldiers, particularly those fighting in World War II, were just regular guys trying to get home alive. Miller’s sacrifice in the film’s final act is both heartbreaking for him as a character, but a painful final word from director Steven Spielberg about the cost of violence. “Saving Private Ryan” was Hanks’ fourth Oscar nomination. It was also nominated for Best Picture and won Spielberg Best Director. —AFBest line: “If the pirates find you, remember, you know this ship. They don’t.”What sets it apart: The true story of the 2009 hijacking of the Maersk Alabama by four Somali pirates is genuinely terrifying. To make his titular role pop, Hanks employs a steady, magnetic presence that consistently makes the chess moves between the criminals and their captives compelling. As the complications mount and the stakes rise, Richard Phillips must calmly navigate a situation many would not survive. Hanks filmed aboard a ship identical to the Maersk Alabama and described an intense production process. “There’s a lot of mental stress,” Hanks said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “[There’s] the anger that goes along with it and the desperation and stuff like that. You’ve got to start at 60 miles an hour.” —AFBest line: “What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean? A good start.” What sets it apart: Hanks wouldn’t accept the role of Andy Beckett if offered it today. “Let’s address ‘Could a straight man do what I did in ‘Philadelphia’ now?’ No and rightly so,” Hanks said in an interview with The New York Times. “It’s not a crime, it’s not boohoo, that someone would say we are going to demand more of a movie in the modern realm of authenticity.”Still, Hanks delivers a tremendous performance as Beckett, a gay attorney whose wrongful termination lawsuit against his former firm springboards director Jonathan Demme’s exploration of homophobia and stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS. “I know that my work in this case is magnified by the fact that the streets of heaven are too crowded with angels,” Hanks said of the public health crisis in his first Oscar acceptance speech. —AFBest line: “I don’t know if we have a destiny, or if we’re all just floatin’ around accidental-like on a breeze, but I think maybe it’s both. Maybe both is happenin’ at the same time.”What sets it apart: Whimsically exploring four decades of American history, Hanks charms as the titular Forrest Gump by maintaining a perfect balance of twee naivety, honest warmth, and comedic brilliance. The actor won his second Academy Award for the part (back-to-back with his win for “Philadelphia”). Despite also earning a Best Picture win, “Forrest Gump” remains a frustratingly undersung chapter for Hanks, who lamented its repeat appearance in anniversary articles arguing “Pulp Fiction” should’ve won that year instead. “Look, I don’t know, but there is a moment of undeniable heartbreaking humanity in ‘Forrest Gump,’” Hanks said in an interview with the New York Times, describing a favorite scene of his between Forrest and Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise). “That’s some intangible shit right there.” —AFBest line: “I know what I have to do now. I got to keep breathing, because tomorrow the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring?” What sets it apart: Chuck Noland suffers more than most movie heroes when his plane crash lands in the Pacific Ocean. The busy FedEx exec soon washes ashore a deserted island and begins a multi-year effort to get back to civilization and Kelly, the woman he loves (Helen Hunt). A survival performance this painful could be one-note, but undertaken by Hanks, Chuck Noland becomes a kaleidoscopic display of the actor’s most subtle talents. Suffice to say, only Hanks could make entire scenes played opposite a static volleyball heartbreaking. He earned his fifth Academy Award nomination for the achievement. —AF",

        "title": "Paul Schrader Praises ‘Asteroid City’ as ‘the Most Wes Anderson Film’ Ever",
        "content": "Paul Schrader might not have seen the memes, but the Oscar winner is calling “Asteroid City” the most Wes Anderson film ever.The “Master Gardener” director took to Facebook to praise Anderson’s “Asteroid City,” comparing it to Alain Resnais’ surreal 1961 French New Wave classic “Last Year at Marienbad.”“The most Wes Anderson film Wes Anderson has made. And for that reason, the best,” Schrader wrote of “Asteroid City,” now in theaters. “He has distilled his design-driven anti-empathy film style to its essence. It’s hard to find a comparable film. The one that comes to mind is ‘Last Year at Marienbad.'”Schrader added, “I’m heartened that it opened so well, though not quite sure why.”Fellow auteur Guillermo del Toro similarly took to Twitter to express his admiration for Anderson’s vision.“Unique signature – What started as an Ashby-esque rhythm and a Demy-esque image design mix, has evolved,” del Toro tweeted. “Now we have a beautiful, painful, and paradoxical exercise in controlled image and neurotic passion. A voice essential to modern cinema.”The buzzy star-studded “Asteroid City” has already become a critical hit due to its ensemble cast comprised in part of Jason Schwartzman, Adrien Brody, Scarlett Johansson, Bryan Cranston, Steve Carell, Maya Hawke, Jeff Goldblum, Ed Norton, Margot Robbie, and Tom Hanks.Anderson spoke to IndieWire’s Eric Kohn about the cinematic inspirations behind “Asteroid City,” including Wim Wenders, Martin Scorsese, and even Schrader himself.“Now we see Paul Schrader with a whole set of later movies that are sort of Bressonian, where he’s taken a sort of focus and taken back something for himself,” Anderson said. “Spielberg’s collaborations with Tony Kushner have produced such interesting work and it’s all later period stuff. Even Francis Coppola, who hasn’t made a movie in some time, is now making something gigantic. He’s taking on a tremendously personal project he’s been wanting to do all these years. It’s a twist on the whole that’s been interesting and surprising. But I’d say each one has a different kind of virtuosity that’s totally unique to them.”He added, “I have tried to do bits like a [Brian] De Palma scene, setting up a sequence like De Palma would, but it’s almost impossible for me to do. [Quentin] Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson have done scenes where they set things up like De Palma and do it well. Not me. I had to find other things in his work. There are certain things he does that I certainly steal but others that I can’t steal, because I’m not capable of it.”Unique signature- What started as an Ashby-esque rhythm and a Demy-esque image design mix, has evolved. Now we have a beautiful, painful and paradoxical exercise in controlled image and neurotic, passion. A voice essential to modern cinema. https://t.co/KB8NPmdGhJ",

        "title": "Netflix’s Freediving Doc ‘The Deepest Breath’ Is Gasp-Inducing — Watch the Trailer",
        "content": "Italian freediver Alessia Zecchini holds a world record in her class of taking only three minutes and 38 seconds to descend an ocean depth of 109 meters. And she was just 18 when she set a prior world record in the deadly sport of freediving — now the subject of Laura McGann’s documentary “The Deepest Breath,” hoping to become the “Free Solo” of diving docs when it streams on Netflix on July 19.In “The Deepest Breath,” Zecchini describes the depths of the ocean as the only quiet place left on Earth as she readies to set a new world record in one of the most dangerous extreme sports ever — to reach underwater depths without scuba gear.Freedivers are regularly subject to blackouts when they return to the surface — with safety divers like Irish adventure-seeker Stephen Keenan at the ready to assist. Forming a bond, the pair started training together after they fell in love with the sport in Dahab, Egypt. The documentary chronicles their attempts on Dahab’s Blue Hole, an 85-foot-long tunnel sitting 184 feet below the Red Sea.From IndieWire’s review of the film out of the 2023 Sundance Film Festival, where “The Deepest Breath” made its world premiere in Park City: “The story of what happened to Alessia Zecchini and Stephen Keenan on that fateful day off the coast of Egypt is riveting enough to withstand some of the frustrations provoked by the way it’s told here. There’s a powerful symmetry to how these two people crossed paths and eventually — potentially — began to fall in love, and ‘The Deepest Breath’ lays it out with the clarity of Bahamian seawater.”Watch the official trailer for “The Deepest Breath” below.",

        "title": "Why Netflix Changed Its Own Measurement System",
        "content": "Netflix, which used to guard its ratings from the public like the Mona Lisa, is changing up its own viewership metrics for greater transparency. (Then again, Netflix used to be against commercials too.)Previously, the streaming giant ranked its Top 10 shows and movies based on hours viewed. It also cut off its all-time Most Popular lists at 28 days of available viewership. Now, the weekly Top 10 will be ranked by “views” (hours viewed divided by runtime) and the all-time lists are being elongated by nine weeks, to 91 days.That’s a full quarter of a year, the same basis on which Netflix and other publicly traded companies report their financial results. It’s important to Netflix that the number be divisible by seven, to capture a whole number of weeks. It’s why the old way was 28 days, not 30 or 31, and why it’s now 91, not 90.Our delayed-viewing culture gives credence to those additional 63 days. It’s true, as Netflix put it in a Tuesday blog post (see below), that “many” Netflix shows and films “grow significantly over time.” That context is valid and important, but let’s be honest: It also gooses Netflix’s numbers in a pretty self-serving way.In recent weeks, Netflix began sprinkling “views” in with its regular metrics in emails to press. An example from last Tuesday: “‘Never Have I Ever’ returned for its fourth and final season with 76.21M hours viewed. Starring Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, the coming-of-age series had over 15M views (76.2M hours viewed divided by 4.9 runtime hours).”The feedback has been positive, both from the media and creators, a Netflix insider told IndieWire. After all, the concept of a “view” is much more digestible than a gigantic number of (millions of) hours. (It’s not a wholly different concept as Nielsen ratings points vs. total viewers. The general public doesn’t understand a ratings point, but they understand 3 million viewers.) Plus, the post-division smaller numbers are easier on the eyes and brain.Probably no coincidence — in timing, at least — is that the WGA and other guilds are currently fighting with studios over, among other things, more transparency from streamers — especially Netflix. This may not necessarily be more transparent, but it’s cleaner.It’s also more fair. The old way disproportionately rewarded longer runtimes, making third-party procedurals look far more impactful than the most culturally relevant limited series.The semantics — and the arithmetic — make a difference. “Wednesday” Season 1 is now Netflix’s all-time most-watched show, not “Stranger Things 4.” Additionally, “The Queen’s Gambit” is now fifth all-time; the limited series wasn’t even on the list before.On the film side, Mark Wahlberg movie “Spenser Confidential” and family film “We Can Be Heroes” are now among the Most Popular features. Both newcomers have runtimes under two hours, which previously created a challenge. Read more instant changes to the Most Popular lists here.No matter how you slice it, South Korean series “Squid Game” Season 1 is still the biggest piece of content Netflix has had. Netflix will not revise the weekly lists it has published since June 2021, a spokesperson told us.Netflix summed today’s changes up in a blog post; read that below.We heard feedback that only providing hours viewed on our Top 10 lists was hard to contextualize, so over the last few months we started to share the views for a good number of our titles (i.e. the number of hours viewed divided by the total run time). This proved to be a more relatable metric for many people, so starting today, while we will continue to show hours viewed per title, our Top10 lists will now be ranked by views. We will also extend the qualifying time for our most popular lists from around one month (28 days) to three months (91 days) given that many of our shows and films grow significantly over time.   As we have always said there is no one perfect streaming metric. But we believe that views combined with total hours viewed is a good evolution because it’s: Our hope is that by being consistent and transparent about what people are watching, Netflix can give everyone — consumers, creators, analysts and press — better insights into what success in streaming looks like more generally. We will continue to share more granular, title-specific data with creators, and as always, we’ll continue to listen to feedback.",

        "content": "Oliver Stone is addressing the “John Wick” franchise as an Army veteran.The “Born on the Fourth of July” Oscar winner told Variety while receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Transilvania Film Festival that “John Wick: Chapter 4” is an example of films becoming more like shoot ’em up video games.“I saw ‘John Wick 4’ on the plane. Talk about volume. I think the film is disgusting beyond belief. Disgusting,” Stone said. “I don’t know what people are thinking. Maybe I was watching ‘G.I. Joe’ when I was a kid. But [Keanu Reeves] kills, what, three, four hundred people in the fucking movie. And as a combat veteran, I’ve got to tell you, not one of them is believable. I realize it’s a movie, but it’s become a video game more than a movie.”Stone added, “It’s lost touch with reality. The audience perhaps likes the video game. But I get bored by it. How many cars can crash? How many stunts can you do? What’s the difference between ‘Fast and Furious’ and some other film? It’s just one thing after another. Whether it’s a super-human Marvel character or just a human being like John Wick, it doesn’t make any difference. It’s not believable.”Still, the “John Wick” films have been critically acclaimed for their stunt work — and have even changed the dialogue around the Academy Awards recognizing stunt work. “John Wick: Chapter 4” director Chad Stahelski earlier this year called out the Academy for never “really considering” including stunt professionals in the awards ceremony. “No great stunt person or performer I know is doing it for accolades or statues. It doesn’t mean that much to us. But it is nice to be recognized by your peers. It’s time,” he said.",

        "content": "The Portland Art Museum’s film and new media hub, also known as PAM CUT // Center for an Untold Tomorrow, has announced new details for the Tomorrow Theater set to open in Portland, Oregon, this fall.The Tomorrow Theater will offer robust, participatory programming, serving as a model, both locally and globally, for the future of media arts and cinema. The space will function as a creative hub for artists and audiences across multimedia.Per PAM CUT, each evening will bring something different, through a variety show approach that incorporates at least two distinct art forms simultaneously. Embracing cinematic storytelling in all its forms — from film and series to animation and gaming, XR, performance, and audio stories — the events and happenings will be as varied as the artists and audiences on any given night. The full programming slate and partnerships will be announced this fall.“Cinematic storytelling, like artists and audiences, comes in all varieties and flavors. With the Tomorrow, we’re building a home for cultural snackers, a space where when people walk through this door, they will never quite know exactly what Tomorrow brings,” said PAM CUT director Amy Dotson in an official statement. “As a home to a multi-media feast of creators, content, and audiences who are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, we are firmly committed to mixing it up. By creating a space where artists collaborate across disciplines, audiences co-mingle and are exposed to a variety of art and media stories folks; they will never have the same experience twice.”Originally imagined as architect Isaac Geller’s 1925 vaudeville theater, the space has lived as everything from an arthouse theater to, most recently, Portland’s porn palace the Oregon Theater. Andee Hess and Makrai Crecelius, of Portland-based and female-owned interior design studio Osmose, designed the theater. Their work has been featured in The New York Times and Architectural Digest as the creative forces behind spaces as varied as Salt & Straw ice cream shops and Fred Armisen’s goth-inspired house.The theater spans nearly 9,000 square feet with 300 modular seats. The theater is also designed to host not only regular screenings but also community and artist events.",

        "content": "Zendaya is down at the tennis courts in Luca Guadagnino‘s latest romance. In the film, the “Euphoria” Emmy winner plays tennis player-turned-coach Tashi who oversees her husband Art’s (Mike Faist) career. But when Art winds up on a losing streak, he is forced to play against his childhood best friend and Tashi’s ex-boyfriend (Josh O’Connor), igniting a tense love triangle with queer undertones. The film is written by Justin Kuritzkes.Director Guadagnino revealed that the cast trained for three months with former professional tennis player Brad Gilbert, who served as a consultant on the film. The “Bones and All” filmmaker added that Zendaya‘s body double was not used in the final cut of the tennis scenes.“I think those three characters in that movie are beautifully complex and really fucked-up people that I love very much. And a sports film, why not?,” the Oscar winner previously told IndieWire. “It’s hyperkinetic, and I do films, so it’s great.”According to Guadagnino, “Challengers” is his “first comedy,” with production set in Boston. The “fairly fizzy, sexy,” according to the director, movie is produced by Guadagnino, Zendaya, Amy Pascal, and Rachel O’Connor, with Bernard Bellew and Kevin Ulrich executive producing. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are behind the music, with United Artists distributing.The film’s first trailer plays up both the sexy undertones of the story, and also indicates that the feature will hinge on at least two time periods, complete with the current-day storyline and looks back at when the trio first meet (and mingle) as rising teen stars, before an injury seems to take Tashi out of the game.Guadagnino’s last film was “Bones and All,” which played the Venice Film Festival in fall 2022. “Challengers” is also expected to drop on the Lido, where Guadagnino’s films regularly show up.“Challengers” premieres September 15 in theaters. Check out the film’s first trailer below.",

        "content": "Samuel L. Jackson is addressing the backlash to longtime co-star Brie Larson as Captain Marvel in the MCU.The “Secret Invasion” actor told Rolling Stone that Oscar winner Larson is an unapologetically “feminist,” which is just something Marvel fans and “incel dudes” alike will have to live with.“Brie’s a stronger person than people give her credit for,” Jackson said of his “Marvels” co-star. “She’s not going to let any of that stuff destroy her. These incel dudes who hate strong women, or the fact that she’s a feminist who has an opinion and expressed it? Everybody wants people to be who they want them to be. She is who she is, and she’s genuinely that.”Jackson reflected on how he and Larson first became friends while working on the 2017 King Kong iteration “Kong: Skull Island.”“We had done ‘Kong’ together, which was not the most wonderful experience for either of us,” Jackson said. “We became great friends during that particular experience because we were having such a hard time.”He continued, “Then, when she was doing her movie [‘Unicorn Store’] and trying to get a particular actor, I was in the makeup trailer with her and was like, ‘Why are you trying to hire this other actor and not trying to get me to do your movie?’ She said, ‘I didn’t think you’d ever do it…so, will you?’ And I was like, ‘Let’s do it.'”Jackson added, “Then, we bonded through the election while we were doing her movie when Donald Trump won. She was broken and I was like, ‘Don’t let ’em break you. You have to be strong now.’ Then, when she got Captain Marvel, she called me and was like, ‘They want me in the Marvel Universe. Should I do it?’ And I was like, ‘Hell yeah! Let’s do it!'”Jackson and Larson appear together again in the upcoming film “The Marvels,” helmed by Nia DaCosta. The movie ties together “Captain Marvel” and Disney+ series “Ms. Marvel” with Larson’s Carol Danvers joining forces with Iman Vellani’s Kamala Khan. Jackson reprises his MCU staple role of Nick Fury.Jackson recently wondered why his Nick Fury has not appeared in any “Black Panther” films thus far, saying, “I’m still trying to figure out why I’ve never been to Wakanda.”The “Jackie Brown” actor added, “Feels like I’ve been playing him forever. If I had it my way, I would’ve been in every Marvel movie because, I mean, he is Nick Fury, he knows everything that’s going on.”",

        "title": "‘Afire’ Trailer: Christian Petzold Lightens Up and Kindles a Romance with Paula Beer",
        "content": "Christian Petzold finds himself somewhere between the lands of late Éric Rohmer and vintage Noah Baumbach with his new romantic drama, “Afire.”The German director of serious war-historical films like “Transit” and “Phoenix,” which bent time both in terms of their cinematic references and their manipulations of stylistic anachronisms, gets less serious with this film about four people vacationing, swapping beds, and surrounded by forest fires. Sideshow and Janus Films release “Afire” this summer on July 14 — it’s a perfectly lovely, summer kind of thing despite its tragic underpinnings. Watch the trailer for “Afire” below.Petzold conceived of “Afire” during the pandemic — though he shot afterward on-location in Germany — after feeling weary of bad news and so postponing another darker project for this deceptively lighter one instead. The film centers on a seaside vacation, when longtime best friends Leon (Thomas Schubert), a pretentious fiction writer struggling to crank out his new book, and Felix (Langston Uibel) show up at Felix’s family’s holiday home to discover Nadja (Paula Beer), a mysterious woman, already staying there. Meanwhile, an ever-encroaching forest fire threatens their well-being, testing relationships and kindling romances. “Afire” won the Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize at the 2023 Berlin Film Festival, where Petzold has regularly premiered his work.With Petzold no longer working with his regular collaborator Nina Hoss — as of last fall, the pair remain on creative hiatus — Paula Beer is now Petzold’s company player. She previously starred in “Transit” and his 2020 pandemic-released “Undine,” a lyrical spin on the mermaid myth, with both films also starring Franz Rogowski.From IndieWire’s review of “Afire”: “This smoldering tour through the life of the mind marks an endearing change of pace for the talented filmmaker, who trades the capital-H history of ‘Phoenix’ and romantic fantasy of ‘Undine’ for a more subdued — and sometimes surprisingly funny — character study.”Look out for “Afire” in theaters on July 14. While the backing of Janus Films implies an eventual Criterion Channel release, Petzold has always made his films expressly for cinemas, telling IndieWire during the pandemic, “For me, looking at big flat screens at home is like him at the bar, very lonely as he recreates the cinema at home on the big screen with a big sound system. It’s not. Cinema is a social place like a bar, a common place where people buy a ticket sitting beside you in darkness who you have never seen before. We are lonely, but we are not alone in our loneliness. This is a fantastic place. This is my big screen.”",

        "content": "Edgar Wright completed the impossible: Finding a crack in the continuity of “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.”Director Christopher McQuarrie revealed to Total Film (via Games Radar) that the latest installment in the decades-running franchise about CIA agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) changed dramatically after Wright viewed the film.“Edgar came to one of the later screenings [of the film] and asked one simple question about a specific sound — kind of an audio cue — and I thought I’d addressed that note. It was so obvious to me,” McQuarrie said. “But it wasn’t obvious to Edgar.”He continued, “And when I asked the audience, it wasn’t obvious to them either. Nobody thought to bring it up until Edgar did. And that changed the entire movie. It changed the entire movie for the better.”McQuarrie added, “You just need honesty and clarity and awareness. No one person, Tom [Cruise] included, can really sit there, and look at the movie 24 hours a day, objectively. Tom and I will just look one another in the eye, and say, ‘Do we want to change this? Or is this what we prefer?'”The production for “Dead Reckoning” included death-defying stunts amid multiple COVID delays. McQuarrie admitted that actress Hayley Atwell was on set for “over 100 days before she had her first dialog scene, owing to the chaotic nature of the production.” The budget reportedly ballooned to upwards of $290 million, while lead star Cruise allegedly pushed production company Paramount via legal action to guarantee a longer theatrical window before PVOD streaming.“That all took place during a very complicated and a very uncertain time,” McQuarrie said of Cruise’s infamous on-set COVID-related outburst that went viral. “Obviously, we’re grateful that people took it the way that it was intended. We were fighting to keep the industry alive, we were fighting to keep people employed, we were fighting for the studio, we were fighting for cinemas, and we still are. We’re still there doing that. I’m just glad people understood the intention behind it.”The film is set for an IMAX release on July 12, with “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” both opening soon after on July 21.",

        "content": "Jonathan Majors appeared in a Manhattan courtroom this morning to hear the assault charges against him. The actor was arrested in New York City on March 25 after police responded to a 911 call from a lower Manhattan apartment where a female, apparently Majors’ girlfriend, had bruises on her head, neck, and finger.The next day, Majors was arraigned on multiple counts of assault in the third degree, three counts of attempted assault in the third degree, one count of aggravated harassment in the second degree, and one count of harassment in the second degree. On April 27, the alleged victim was granted a restraining order against Majors.His criminal defense lawyer Priya Chaudhry said, “Jonathan Majors is completely innocent and is provably the victim of an altercation with a woman he knows.” She will represent him when the case goes to trial. It was announced during Majors’ court appearance June 20 that the trial will begin in Manhattan on August 3.Since the charges were filed, Majors has been dropped by his publicity team, the Lede Company, and his management company, Entertainment 360.He’s also been dropped by Protagonist Pictures’ adaptation of the Walter Mosley novel “The Man in My Basement,” from a Texas Rangers ad campaign, and a U.S. Army ad campaign featuring him has been paused. No word yet on Searchlight’s plans for his high-profile Sundance premiere “Magazine Dreams,” slated to release later this year. And no word on his future with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where he was intended to be the major villain anchoring the next two phases of films.",

        "content": "Christopher Nolan doesn’t believe in divine intervention when it comes to artificial intelligenceThe director, whose “Oppenheimer” opens July 21, discussed the future of AI in a Wired cover story.“The issue with AI, to me, is a very simple one. It’s like the term ‘algorithm,'” Nolan said. “We watch companies use algorithms, and now AI, as a means of evading responsibility for their actions.”The “Tenet” director continued, “If we endorse the view that AI is all-powerful, we are endorsing the view that it can alleviate people of responsibility for their actions — militarily, socio­economically, whatever. The biggest danger of AI is that we attribute these godlike characteristics to it and therefore let ourselves off the hook.”Nolan added, “I don’t know what the mythological underpinnings of this are, but throughout history there’s this tendency of human beings to create false idols, to mold something in our own image and then say we’ve got godlike powers because we did that.”Nolan said that media coverage of ChatGPT and OpenAI illustrated to the public how the technology could be “really dangerous,” only fueling the widespread intrigue further.“So now everyone wants it. Doesn’t mean there isn’t a real danger here, because I feel that there is,” Nolan said. “But I personally, and this is just my opinion, I identify the danger as the abdication of responsibility.”The “Inception” filmmaker added, “I feel that AI can still be a very powerful tool for us. I’m optimistic about that. I really am. But we have to view it as a tool. The person who wields it still has to maintain responsibility for wielding that tool. If we accord AI the status of a human being, the way at some point legally we did with corporations, then yes, we’re going to have huge problems.”And Nolan isn’t the only Hollywood icon weighing in on the current rise of AI. Steven Soderbergh recently said that he’s “not afraid” of AI, while Joe Russo predicted AI films are approximately two years away. “Black Mirror” creator Charlie Brooker revealed he wrote a “shitty” sci-fi episode using ChatGPT, while HBO executive Casey Bloys warned of a creative future dependent on generated material.",

        "content": "After three weeks of PVOD play, “John Wick: Chapter 4” (now $5.99) returns to #1 on two of the three leading top ten charts with the lower price. Lionsgate delayed home availability for an unusual two months for this hit theatrical release, thus making an earlier than usual reduction of price unsurprising. Nor is its return to #1 (except on Vudu, which measures by revenue, not transactions) unexpected.Vudu continues with the latest “Fast and Furious” franchise release — “Fast X” — at #1. It fell to #3 at iTunes, while almost certainly an error has resulted in it being nowhere currently on Google Play’s chart (it was #1 as recently as Saturday).The appeal of action titles is also shown at both Netflix and elsewhere on the VOD charts. Netflix’s original film “Extraction 2” with Chris Hemsworth (and an added Idris Elba) is #1 there, with its 2020 predecessor #3. “Kandahar” (Open Road) with Gerard Butler in an Afghanistan rescue story, which grossed under $5 million in theaters when it played just weeks ago, had a strong debut at $19.99. It placed #4 on two charts, #6 on a third.Its strong response comes in contrast to the struggles of “Are You There, God? It’s Me Margaret” (Lionsgate). Though it grossed more than four times what “Kandahar” did and had some of the best reviews for a studio release this year, with the detriment of a $19.99 rental price it made only the Vudu list last week. This week, it’s on no list at all. “Beau Is Afraid” (A24) is another disappointing theatrical release that might have been expected to show some home life, but at $19.99, little so far.“The Super Mario Bros. Movie” (Universal) is #2 on all three lists (though it might have been a notch lower on Google Play had “Fast X” been listed). Three other films made all the charts — “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” (Paramount) and “The Pope’s Exorcist” (Sony), both at $5.99, and “The Covenant” (MGM), still at $19.99.The just-released Robert De Niro comedy “About My Father” (Lionsgate), which grossed under $12 million, placed on both iTunes and Vudu. “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” (Sony) was in the top five of both iTunes and Google Play, with its $3.99 rental excluding it from the elevated Vudu revenue levels.“Extraction 2” ends an unusual situation where not only were no Netflix originals #1, for over a week none was even on their top 10. This week, apart from the two “Extractions” on the list, “Black Clover: Sword of the Wizard King,” a Japanese animated film, appears, marking three originals there at the moment.But Netflix viewers’ enthusiasm for recent mid-level hits with heartland appeal shows itself again with Clint Eastwood’s “The Mule” #2 currently.

        "title": "‘M:I-7’ First Reactions: The Most a ‘Part 1 of 2’ Has ‘Felt Like Its Own Film,’ but It’s No ‘Fallout’",
        "content": "You’ve all seen Tom Cruise drive a motorcycle off a cliff in the first trailer, and the second, for ‘Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.’ Now, the first reactions from critics are here and they are strong, if not quite as strong as they were for “Mission: Impossible — Fallout,” the beloved most recent installment from 2018. But they are mostly shouting their praise as if they were Cruise himself yelling (rightly) on set about the importance of Covid safety.IndieWire’s own Executive Editor of Film, Kate Erbland, said it did the “best job yet of recent ‘part 1 of 2!!’ features in feeling like its own film while setting up for the next half.” That alone is worthy of praise because many of these films have struggled with this, ever since “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows — Part 1” inaugurated the form in 2011.This appears to be a slightly more plot-oriented “Mission: Impossible” film, but the action scenes within, though fewer in number than the past, are massive. “Huge variety of action and a final set piece that ranks 2-3 all-time for the franchise,” said Germain Lussier, while noting “it gets a little dense at times.”Uproxx’s Mike Ryan shared a little bit of its plot, that apparently “Dead Reckoning” is an “ambitious examination of/meditation on AI and the dangerous path we might be on.” He noted, however, that it’s “not as satisfying as FALLOUT.”Fandango’s Erik Davis also praised how it feels like a standalone film: “I had the absolute best time watching #MissionImpossible… it both felt complete and left you dying for what comes next.”People’s Nigel Smith might be the most enthusiastic of all: “It reinvigorated my love for the summer blockbuster.”TheWrap’s Scott Mendelson was the most negative, though, saying the film was “a big letdown. Wonky dialogue, oddly broad acting, and narrative contrivances/shortcuts that (being generous) seemed like COVID-related issues. Felt “off” in a way akin to ‘Saw 3-D’ after ‘Saw VI’. For the sake of the industry, I hope I’m in the minority.”After the insanity of the last few films, #MissionImpossible7 has a tremendous amount to live up to, but one thing I’ll say now in quick reaction format: it does the best job yet of recent “part 1 of 2!!” features in feeling like its own film while setting up for the next half.#MissionImpossible – Dead Reckoning Part 1 is fantastic.\n\nDynamite, timely story. Excellent new characters. Huge variety of action and a final set piece that ranks top 2-3 all-time for the franchise.\n\nIt gets a little dense at times but its pace & intensity more than cover that. pic.twitter.com/prm2wa6ZD6MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – DEAD RECKONING PART ONE works as Christopher McQuarrie’s ambitious examination of/meditation on AI and the dangerous path we might be on. (He doesn’t like it) With the inherent nature of being “part one” (said that a lot lately), not as satisfying as FALLOUTI had the absolute best time watching #MissionImpossible – an impeccably made action film that does not stop entertaining. Each action sequence is long, crazy & intense. The story is big & sprawling, but I like how it both felt complete & left you dying for what comes next pic.twitter.com/iNaKlDMH8lThere's a car chase scene in #MissionImpossibleDeadReckoning that brought me so much joy, it reinvigorated my love for the summer blockbuster. The craftsmanship of this franchise is unmatched. The final train sequence is a whopper too – I caught myself leaning IN from my seat.#MissionImpossible7 was a big letdown. Wonky dialogue, oddly broad acting, and narrative contrivances/shortcuts that (being generous) seemed like COVID-related issues. Felt \"off\" in a way akin to 'Saw 3-D' after 'Saw VI'.

        "title": "Wes Anderson Is Right to ‘Immediately Erase’ Videos He Receives Reimagining Movies in His Style",
        "content": "In addition to waxing rhapsodic about Elia Kazan in his interview with IndieWire’s Eric Kohn, Wes Anderson talked about just why he was so drawn to portraying the 1950s. As the rave reviews for the film have indicated, it’s a time period uniquely suited to Anderson’s meticulous aesthetic.And that’s a style that fans seem hellbent on replicating themselves, via the palest of imitations, through TikTok videos that show off their creators attempting “The Wes Anderson Challenge.” Symmetrical compositions, intense color coordination, shoebox diorama-like use of the frame and depth of field. All there. All not nearly as good as anything Anderson can do himself. Each imitation is more obvious than the last: And as Kohn indicated in his piece, these imitations are not something Anderson himself ever pays attention to.Now the director’s opened up a little bit more about his dismissal of the imitators in an interview with The Times (via The Independent).“I’m very good at protecting myself from seeing all that stuff,” he said.“If somebody sends me something like that I’ll immediately erase it and say, ‘Please, sorry, do not send me things of people doing me.’ Because I do not want to look at it, thinking, ‘Is that what I do? Is that what I mean?’ I don’t want to see too much of someone else thinking about what I try to be because, God knows, I could then start doing it.”Aside from the offensiveness of fans thinking they know a director’s style better than the director (or thinking it can be so easily boiled down to AI-ready bullet points of an essence), it’s so indicative of the moment, in which poor copies of great work are thought to be entertaining of themselves. The particular concepts that have gone viral such as a Wes Anderson-meets-“Star Wars” concept called “The Galactic Menagerie” (powered entirely by AI animation of course) could not be more obvious and tired.Believe it or not there are striking symmetrical compositions in “Star Wars” too — the opening shot of the original film, with the Imperial Star Destroyer flying overhead, practically qualifies on its own. Yes, actually, the maker of “Star Wars” had a distinct visual eye of his own, with environments he populated with characters and creatures as “quirky” as anything Anderson himself has come up with. Making bold artistic choices for how to use the frame is generally considered a foundation of filmmaking.It’s another sign of creativity flattened as knowledge of film culture and history continues to shrink: Wes Anderson has to meet “Star Wars” because there are no other reference points the parodists are aware of. At least the parody that may have kicked off all of these, SNL’s imagining of an Anderson horror movie, “The Midnight Coterie of Sinister Intruders,” did more than offer an algorithmic mashup.Giving a close read to a filmmaker’s style — how they use color, lighting, framing, depth of field, blocking of the actors — is essential for film literacy. But to be film literate, it’s important to be “well read,” so to speak. There is more to cinema than Anderson (and “Star Wars”), and there is so much more to Anderson’s cinema than the tropes that some of his more literal-minded admirers keep insisting on identifying.It’s artistic appreciation as the pinning of butterflies to a board. It’s comedy as the mere identification of tropes and adding nothing more. One’s worldview reduced to simply pointing things out like Rick Dalton sitting on his couch, beer can in hand, index finger extended in recognition to his TV screen.When does an homage become an insult? What the imitators don’t understand is that Anderson’s work is far more irreducible than they insist it is, so much more alive than anything that could be that parody-ready. Where’s the “She’s my Rushmore, Max” moment in any of these parodies? The “but I will say, he certainly sustained the illusion with a marvelous grace”? There’s deep human feeling in Anderson’s films. You will not find that in the parodies. There’s extraordinary craft in Anderson’s films (every frame of “Isle of Dogs” was carefully lit). You will not see that appreciated in the parodies.The tropes are not in Anderson’s films but in the lack of imagination of these “fans.”",

        "title": "Elliot Page Turned Down Role Requiring Feminine Clothes: ‘I Would Want to Kill Myself’",
        "content": "In his new memoir, “Pageboy,” Elliot Page opens up about the difficulties he faced with his gender identity in the years of his career before he came out as trans in December 2020. One was dealing with prejudice and harassment within the industry, as when one A-List actor said “I’m going to fuck you to make you realize you’re not gay.”Another of those difficulties was having to play femme characters and wear feminine clothing. On one occasion, Page decided he’d had enough and told his agents to turn down a part that required period women’s couture.“I would imagine myself in a woman’s costume from the mid-nineteenth century. The dress, the shoes, the hair, flashed before my eyes. It was too much after having put on the mask for awards season,” Page wrote, probably of the aftermath of the “Juno” awards campaign in late 2007/early 2008.“I understood that if I were to do it, I would want to kill myself.”He said it was a “sought after” role from a “famous book” — a likely candidate is Cary Joji Fukunaga’s 2011 adaptation of “Jane Eyre,” which ultimately starred Mia Wasikowska.Playing non-male characters was “too much,” and the Netflix series “The Umbrella Academy” even had his female character Vanya Hargreeves come out as a trans man named Viktor in the season immediately following Page’s own coming out. How could he play feminine roles onscreen when the role he “played in [his] personal life was suffocating [him] already.”“I pushed myself to dispel the truth for fear of banishment, but I was despondent, trapped in a dismal disguise. An empty, aimless shell,” Page said. “It wasn’t easy to explain to my reps that I couldn’t take on a role because of clothing. A face would scrunch up and tilt sideways, ‘But you’re an actor?’ Wardrobe fittings for films ripped at my insides, talons gashing my organs.”“I cringed at the way people lit up when seeing me in feminine clothing, as if I had accomplished a miraculous feat,” he added.“People would go, ‘Well, you’re an actor. Just put on the f–king clothes.’ You know? But needless to say, it was so much more than that.” ",

        "title": "Zoe Saldaña Reacts to ‘Avatar’ Sequel Delays: ‘Great! I’m Gonna Be 53 When the Last Movie Comes Out’",
        "content": "At this point, “Avatar” fans have become quite good at delayed gratification. “Avatar: The Way of Water” was originally scheduled to come out in 2014, but the sequel was delayed multiple times due to James Cameron’s desire to “future-proof” the franchise by inventing new technologies before they were needed. The film ended up hitting theaters in 2022, and its massive critical and box office success proved that audiences were still hungry for stories about Pandora after 13 years.“Avatar 3” will be a much quicker turnaround because the second and third films were shot concurrently. But while the upcoming sequel was originally slated for a December 2024 release, Disney recently pushed it back to 2025 when it shuffled its release calendar this week. The move ended up delaying the entire “Avatar” franchise, so the fifth and final movie is now set to open in 2031.As painful as the delay might be for “Avatar” fans, it’s not exactly convenient for the cast either. In an Instagram story announcing the news, Zoe Saldaña joked that her involvement the franchise will now span over 25 years of her life.“Great! I’m gonna be 53 when the last ‘Avatar’ comes out,” Saldaña wrote. “I was 27 when I shot the very first ‘Avatar.’” Throughout the entire process, Cameron and his team have continued to assure fans that the delays will be worth the wait. “Avatar 3” is expected to continue to expand the world of Pandora, introducing audiences to a new tribe of villainous Na’vi that live among fire.“The fire will be represented by the ‘Ash People.’ I want to show the Na’vi from another angle because, so far, I have only shown their good sides,” Cameron said in a 2022 interview. “In the early films, there are very negative human examples and very positive Na’vi examples. In ‘Avatar 3,’ we will do the opposite. We will also explore new worlds, while continuing the story of the main characters. I can say that the last parts will be the best. The others were an introduction, a way to set the table before serving the meal.”",

        "title": "‘Rebel Moon’ First Look: Behind the Scenes of Zack Snyder’s Netflix Space Opera",
        "content": "After directing “Army of the Dead” for Netflix in 2021, Zack Snyder is preparing to return to the streaming service for his next blockbuster. The “Justice League” director’s latest film is “Rebel Moon,” an original sci-fi epic that he co-wrote and directed and is set to stream this December.Netflix used its TUDUM fan event in Brazil on Saturday as an opportunity to give fans a first look at the new film. In lieu of a trailer, Netflix released a new behind-the-scenes video that shows Snyder and his team creating the intergalactic world of the new space opera.The official synopsis for “Rebel Moon” reads, When a peaceful colony on the edge of a galaxy finds itself threatened by the armies of a tyrannical ruling force, Kora (Sofia Boutella), a mysterious stranger living among the villagers, becomes their best hope for survival. Tasked with finding trained fighters who will unite with her in making an impossible stand against the Mother World, Kora assembles a small band of warriors — outsiders, insurgents, peasants and orphans of war from different worlds who share a common need for redemption and revenge. As the shadow of an entire Realm bears down on the unlikeliest of moons, a battle over the fate of a galaxy is waged, and in the process, a new army of heroes is formed.“Rebel Moon” is written by Snyder, Shay Hatten, and Kurt Johnstad. The film stars Charlie Hunnam, Anthony Hopkins, Sofia Boutella, Djimon Hounsou, Ed Skrein, Michiel Huisman, Doona Bae, and Ray Fisher.Snyder has previously stated that he views the project as an homage to George Lucas (and the filmmakers who influenced Lucas), and hopes that he can build “Rebel Moon” into his own sci-fi franchise that exists on the same scale as “Star Wars.”“This is me growing up as an Akira Kurosawa fan, a ‘Star Wars’ fan,” Snyder said when the project was announced in 2021. “It’s my love of sci-fi and a giant adventure. My hope is that this also becomes a massive IP and a universe that can be built out.”“Rebel Moon” streams exclusively on Netflix on Friday, December 22. Check out the behind-the-scenes video below.",

        "title": "Black TV Shows and Movies to Watch This Juneteenth",
        "content": "The media was not quick to embrace Black creatives nor has Juneteenth long been something on its radar. (Historically, as Black artists have entered television, the discussion of Black holidays has tended to be nonexistent, with only the occasional look at Kwanzaa thrown in around December.) But as different voices enter the culturally and politically shifting landscape, the newly recognized federal holiday — which honors the emancipation of the last enslaved people here in the United States on June 19 — could, or at the very least should, pop up more on screens large and small.Channing Godfrey Peoples made her directorial debut against the backdrop of Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020 with “Miss Juneteenth“: a feature film starring Nicole Beharie and Alexis Chikaeze as a mother-daughter pair navigating their opposing dreams for the young girl’s future. Before that, “Juneteenth” was the title of Season 1, Episode 9 in Donald Glover’s beloved “Atlanta”: a boundary-breaking FX dramedy about Blackness and celebrity with a surrealist twist.From tentpoles that changed the box-office game (see “Get Out” and “Black Panther”) to smaller indie achievements (“Fruitvale Station,” “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” and yes, “Moonlight”), not all of the picks that appear in the following list of recommendations have Juneteenth-centric stories or themes, per se. However, all of them honor and revere Black actors and other creatives, as well as tell stories that are heartwarming, powerful, emotionally resonant, and interesting to revisit for Juneteenth 2023. All entires are listed chronologically by release year; alphabetically therein.With editorial contribution by Wilson Chapman, Jacqueline Coley, Jude Dry, Kristen Lopez, Leonardo Adrian Garcia, Jenna Marotta, Wilson Morales, Noel Murray, Anne Thompson, and Ben Travers.UCLA grad Gina Prince-Bythewood ran track in college. At the center of her first feature, developed at the Sundance Institute’s directing and writing lab and produced by Spike Lee, she put into romantic conflict two L.A. athletes, who are childhood sweethearts (Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps). Over the years, as they play basketball through high school, college and into the professional leagues, they wrestle with complicated issues of love and friendship, competitiveness and gender identity, as they date other people and struggle with making it in the sport they adore. The sports romance broke out its two leads and writer-director, scoring over $27 million at the domestic box office. —ATWith Will Smith playing the iconic and legendary boxer Muhammad Ali, the stakes were high for him to deliver a career-defining performance, and boy did he ever. With Michael Mann’s direction, Smith showcased a different range of acting from the action-packed films we had previously seen him in. Embodying Cassius Clay meant charting his deepening religious beliefs, plus mixing politics and sports with some marital woes. Smith packed on the pounds, unleashed some great boxing moves, and displayed a level of emotional pull that compelled audiences to see him as The Greatest.The drama was also aided by the performances of Jamie Foxx, Jon Voight, Jeffrey Wright, and Smith’s wife, Jada Pinnkett Smith, in their only film together (outside of that “Men in Black 3” cameo). Smith received his first Oscar nod for Best Actor, and rightly so. While films such as “The Fighter,” “Rocky,” “The Champ,” and more recently “Creed” have their fair share of fans, “Ali” ranks alongside “Raging Bull” as one of the few satisfying boxing biopics. —WMWhen “Training Day” came out, Denzel Washington didn’t have much left to prove, beyond winning a Best Actor Oscar (he had a supporting trophy for “Glory”). His 1999 performance in “Hurricane” had been overlooked, but then came his four collaborations with Antoine Fuqua. In the first, urban classic “Training Day,” Washington reinvented his persona. As corrupt Detective Alonzo Harris, he finds himself paired with a new partner, Officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). During their drives through crime-ridden pockets of Los Angeles, Hoyt sees the dirty underworld that Harris loves, and is reluctant to join. He doesn’t know if Harris is his friend or foe. Fuqua made sure this wasn’t your ordinary buddy-buddy action-thriller cop film. In the most memorable scene, Harris proclaims, “King Kong ain’t got shit on me!” We hadn’t seen Washington play the bad guy before, and with his ferocious, dominating, and charismatic performance, the Oscar was his. —WMWhen “Hustle & Flow” first premiered at Sundance in 2005, no one knew what to expect. We had a new director (Craig Brewer) on the scene with Terrence Howard — after over 30 films to his credit — finally attempting to break out in a lead role. Most of the rap films we had seen at the time were set either in New York or LA, but this entertaining story takes place in the South, specifically Memphis, Tennessee. Howard, sporting a James Brown perm, plays an aspiring drug dealer and pimp named Djay looking to change his game and become a rapper. With Anthony Anderson acting as his producer/sound man and Taraji P. Henson, Taryn Manning, and Paula Jai Parker as his backup singers, Djay has to deal with the daily grinds of making ends meet while putting together a demo for his hopeful meeting with a local legend who made it out of the hood. Along with a song (“It’s Hard Out Here for a Pimp”) that won the Academy Award and Howard’s show-stopping performance — which netted him a Best Actor nod — “Hustle & Flow” certainly is among the emotional, uplifting feel good films that folks love to watch more than once. —WMWhen discussing comedians who became dramatic actors, Oscar winners Robin Williams and Jamie Foxx come to mind, as do nominees Jim Carrey and Steve Carell. But none had a more extreme transformation than Mo’Nique for “Precious.” Based on Sapphire’s 1996 novel “Push” and directed by Lee Daniels, the film cast her as Mary, a hellish Harlem mother who sexually abuses her illiterate teen daughter (newcomer Gabourey Sidibe). Always-bullied Precious has lived a life of continuous trauma, culminating when she learns that her father has given her HIV. But through the kindness of a teacher (Paula Patton), social worker (Mariah Carey), and hospital employee (Lenny Kravitz), she begins to acquire her own agency, eventually severing ties with Mary to become a responsible parent herself.The jarring film’s production team included Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry, each vocal survivors of sexual assault. Mo’Nique won an Academy Award, while a thriving television career (“The Big C,” “American Horror Story,” “Empire”) awaited Sidibe. Today, her self-possessed characters are rarely ever the victims. —JMCreated by Eric Ellis Overmeyer and David Simon, “Treme” follows a group of New Orleans residents in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The series boasted an all-star cast including Wendell Pierce, who’d worked with Simon previously on “The Wire,” John Goodman, Khandi Alexander, and Steve Zahn to name a few and was groundbreaking for its portrayal of New Orleans and its citizens. The series was nominated for six Emmy awards over its lifetime (running from 2010-2013) and ultimately won for its Sound Mixing. —KL Dee Rees’ first feature is a gracefully rendered coming-of-age story that draws inspiration from her own. Humming with the electricity of repressed sexuality finally unbridled, “Pariah” follows teenage Alike (Adepero Oduye) on a journey towards queerness and masculine gender expression. We witness Alike quietly change out of her baseball hat and t-shirt on the train home to Brooklyn, donning a girly sweater in order to calm her parents’ suspicions (Kim Wayans and Charles Parnell). We melt alongside her as she lights up with the first tingles of love, seeing herself as desirable for the first time through the sparkling eyes of Bina (Aasha Davis). Cinematographer Bradford Young (“Arrival”) films Alike’s first nights out at the club in rich, saturated colors. The movie pulses with the rhythm of first love and the cost of self-discovery. “Pariah” was slightly ahead of its time, but as Rees’ star continues to rise, it has finally gotten its due. —JDThe brilliant, original four-hankie dystopian family drama from New Orleans newcomer Benh Zeitlin far surpassed any expectations for a scruffy $1.5 million effort from an unknown film collective, cast and crew, even after it took home the Sundance Grand Jury Prize. The actors were mostly non-pros who workshopped their roles. Nine-year-old discovery Quvenzhane Wallis’s winning personality carries the film as Hushpuppy and earned an Oscar nomination; Dwight Henry was working as a baker before playing her father. No one could have predicted that a movie about the end of the world, shot in a chaotic run-and-gun cinema verite style with handheld digital cameras on a constantly flooding abandoned delta island below the New Orleans levees — complete with homemade non-CGI special effects like the film’s titular Aurochs — would score four Oscar nods, including director (knocking out Ben Affleck), adapted screenplay and picture. Yet again, a rooted homegrown story conjured up emotions that were universal. —ATIn October 1970, Angela Davis was arrested in New York City, accused of supplying weapons to Jonathan Jackson, who took hostages in a courtroom, whom he hoped to exchange for his brother George Jackson, an alleged Black radical imprisoned at San Quentin. In the subsequent shootout with police, Jonathan Jackson was killed, along with Judge Harold Haley and two inmates. Davis, who had championed the cause of organizing Black prisoners and was friends (later became romantically involved) with George Jackson, was indicted in the crime. But she went into hiding, becoming one of the FBI’s most wanted criminals. She was eventually apprehended and her trial drew international attention. Shola Lynch’s “Free Angela and All Political Prisoners” relives those eventful, uncertain, transformative early years of Davis’ life. In the film, the legendary radical activist speaks for the first time about her imprisonment, which became a flashpoint in an unrelenting Black liberation struggle and turned her into a revolutionary icon. —TO“12 Years a Slave” is powerful and excruciating to watch at the same time. Steve McQueen’s vision of 19th century slavery, emboldened by first-rate performances by Chiwetel Ejiofor (Solomon Northup), Lupita N’yongo (Patsey), and Micheal Fassbender (Edwin Epps) allowed audiences to witness the degradation of humanity that couples institutionalized oppression. Solomon Northup’s story of adduction and bondage is especially painful today; modern African American viewers can’t help but think, “Is this what would happen to me? Would I attempt to escape? Or would I, like Solomon, eventually bend to my oppressors and try to forget myself as a means of self-preservation?”The slow dismantling of will is just like a wound, one that throbs with the pain until it eventually heals. Watching Solomon and Patsy fester in the pain Epps inflicts on them leaves little room for solace, but the healing balm of Solomon’s eventual liberation eventually remove the sting. Though not a film many revisit, the final moments — when Solomon reunites with his family — is one that will reverberate for ages. —JCThis Sundance Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award winner opens security footage of the real Oscar Grant — shot in the back and killed by a police officer in an Oakland, Calif. train station in 2009 — and closes with a clip of his now-fatherless daughter. For his first full-length film, writer-director Ryan Coogler cast Michael B. Jordan as the slain 22-year-old. The role was complicated, not just because there were surviving relatives to think of, and mounting statistics about how Black men fared worse in the criminal justice system than their white counterparts, if they even made it to a court room. In the film, Grant is full of flaws. He’s been to jail, he’s cheated on his girlfriend, he’s been fired from the grocery store where he works. But he’s young, dynamic, and, aware of his family responsibilities, trying to make good choices. That’s how he wound up riding the BART on the last night of his life: it was New Year’s Eve, and he didn’t want to drink and drive. “Fruitvale Station” offers no social remedies, but by recreating Grant’s final hours, it actualizes him as a man, not just a rallying cry. —JMRunning on ABC from 2014 to 2022, “Black-ish” has examined numerous issues with regards to family in general and being a Black family in particular. Their Season 4 premiere actually examined the history of Juneteenth itself. Appropriately named “Juneteenth,” the episode sees family patriarch Dre (Anthony Anderson), irked by a historically inaccurate Columbus Day play at his kids school, enlist the help of Aloe Blacc to create a song celebrating Juneteenth. —KL  Tessa Thompson, lately of Marvel tentpoles (“Thor: Love and Thunder”), spent almost a decade as a working actor before filming her breakout role in “Dear White People” (2014): writer-director Justin Simien’s Sundance award-winning film that inspired the namesake Netflix series (appearing later on this list). As Sam White, an acerbic Black college student/author who unnerves the white administration with her radio show; she broadcasts missives such as, “The minimum requirement of Black friends needed to not seem racist has just been raised to two,” and, “Dating a Black person to piss off your parents is a form of racism.”But her narrative is just one of several that forces members of the Winchester University community (and viewers) to question internalized angst about how they are perceived by strangers. Like “Atlanta,” the film explores how two members of the same race can have vastly different experiences depending on how dark their skin is, as well as why certain people can say and act one way, but not others. The racially-tinged hostilities build to a squirm-inducing party where the white school president’s son invites all attendees to wear blackface. —JMAva DuVernay picked up a camera for the first time at the age of 32. By 40, she was onset with Oprah Winfrey, directing her and David Oyelowo in the Martin Luther King biopic “Selma.” Though this may seem a meteoric rise, one can’t help but assume if her race and gender had been different, her talent would have her holding a few Oscars (she did get nominated, for documentary “13th”), and helming a Star Wars or Marvel-type franchise. Nevertheless, “Selma” catapulted her into the stratosphere of modern filmmakers.The most impressive thing about “Selma” is its transformative nature. It turned King into a man with complexities and flaws that are often glossed over in hagiographic Hollywood biopics. More than that, it transformed DuVernay into one of the most talented directors of our time. As Spike Lee did with “Malcolm X,” DuVernay forced the audience to look at King from all angles — a luminary whose politics still ignite the Black community, but also a man, with personal failings and moments of ungoverned indiscretion. It must have been a daunting challenge to embody all of that, but Oyelowo cleared it with room to spare. When April Reign tweeted in 2015, “#OscarsSoWhite they asked to touch my hair,’” she was making a joke that went viral — but the Academy’s snub of both DuVernay and Oyelowo was anything but funny. The ensuing firestorm sent shockwaves throughout the industry, which still reverberate to this day. —JCSean Baker’s audacious farce following a day in the life of two trans girls working the streets of downtown Los Angeles is infinitely re-watchable and required viewing if you somehow missed it in 2015. Baker earned major points for casting actual trans women in the lead, and it paid off. Mya Taylor and Kitana Kiki Rodriquez saturate the film in such authentic flavor, it’s enough to make one swear off professional actors altogether. Shot entirely on iPhone (with the help of an anamorphic adapter), “Tangerine” made waves when it premiered at Sundance in 2015. It looks great, but it’s the raw intimacy Baker captured on camera that made “Tangerine” an instant queer classic. —JDAva DuVernay’s documentary could serve as the second in a trilogy on the history and legacy of racial injustice in the United States — “Selma” would be the first, and limited series “When They See Us” (2019) would be the third. Exploring the intersection of race and justice in the United States from a historical perspective, “13th” makes a direct connection between slavery and mass incarceration. That historical link operates as a bridge between the harsh truths uncovered in Sam Pollard’s eye-opening 2012 documentary “Slavery By Another Name” and Angela Davis’ 1997 tome “The Prison Industrial Complex.” —TOPremiering in 2016, Donald Glover’s “Atlanta” was one of the most audacious and interesting series of its time (though the stretch between seasons often felt interminable). In 2016 the series premiered its episode focused on Juneteenth. Directed by Janicza Bravo, the episode follows Glover’s character of Earn and Zazie Beetz’s Van as they attend a Juneteenth-centric party at the house of an upscale interracial couples home. Suffice it to say a lot of awkward conversations ensue that provoke in the way “Atlanta” usually does. —KL  For his third directorial outing (after “The Debaters” and “Antwone Fisher”), Denzel Washington skirted the hazards of “opening up” a play by chasing honest emotions. The two-time acting Oscar-winner took on the film adaptation of August Wilson’s ’50s Pittsburgh family drama “Fences” both as director and disgruntled former baseball player Troy Maxson, rejoining his fellow Tony-winning 2010 Broadway revival costar Viola Davis as his beleaguered wife Rose. Washington told Davis two things on the Pittsburgh location: “Don’t forget the love,” and “Trust me.” So Davis went big, letting Troy have it when he tells his wife of 18 years that he has been unfaithful. Debuting film actor Jovan Adepo (“The Leftovers”) shines in a key scene as high school football player Cory, who is crushed when his father tells him to quit the team and take back his job at a grocery store. “How come you ain’t never liked me?” he asks his father. “Liked you?” responds Troy. “Who the hell say I got to like you?” —ATIt’s Baz Luhrmann’s one-season wonder about the rise of hip-hop in 1970s New York: a tender romance, exhilarating musical, and passionate piece of history, all at once. The music is reason enough to check out all 11 episodes, but don’t sleep on the cast: “The Get Down” helped put Justice Smith and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II on Hollywood’s radar, while veteran stars like Jimmy Smits, David Diggs, Giancarlo Esposito, Ron Cephas Jones, Billy Porter, and Renée Elise Goldsberry all embraced Baz Luhrmann’s swirling world of genre-bending beats, bringing each character in the ecstatic production to heart-pounding life. —BTThe top-earning Best Picture nominee of 2017 ($236 million), “Hidden Figures” presented three brilliant Black women who just wanted to do their jobs. And they did: their expertise at a NASA field center helped send the first Americans into orbit, an extra-amazing feat since each was hobbled by segregation laws still in effect in the early ’60s. Mathematician Katherine Goble (Taraji P. Henson) had to trek a half-mile to use the bathroom at work; Dorothy Vaughan was reprimanded for conducting research in a library’s whites-only section; and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) went to court seeking enrollment in an off-limits engineering program.Rated PG, the film aimed to be widely accessible, including a love story (between Henson and her previous “Curious Case of Benjamin Button” co-star Mahershala Ali), friendship excursions, historical context, and countdown drama. Budgeted at just $25 million, writer-director-producer Theodore Melfi delivered the first live-action, non-franchise film in six years that featured multiple female leads and registered successive victories at the weekend box office (its predecessor: “The Help”). The source material was Margot Lee Shetterly’s eponymous book, optioned before publication by 20th Century Fox. Beyond acknowledging the accomplishments of this trio and their peers, and the continued need for women in STEM jobs, “Hidden Figures” produced perhaps the most scholarly Barbie doll to ever sell out. —JMIt’s impossible to overstate the significance of “Moonlight” — as a cinematic masterpiece, as inspiration to independent filmmakers like Barry Jenkins, but primarily for Black gay men — who deserve so many more examples of profound art that mirrors their experience. (For now, the best queer film of the 21st century will have to do). “Moonlight” was about so much more than representation, but it landed like a shot of adrenaline into the awards season release schedule because there are far too many stories we’ve heard a million times and far too many left woefully unexplored. Adapted from a short play by Tarrell Alvin McRaney, “In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue,” Jenkins’ triptych film explores a young Black boy’s identity at three crucial stages.Jenkins has said he wasn’t interested in making a film about his Miami childhood, but McCraney’s play allowed him to tell the story at an emotional distance through the lens of queerness. “Moonlight” is emotionally wrought, finely tuned, and beautifully executed. Perhaps its biggest triumph is the extent to which Jenkins was able to poignantly render a queer story by placing himself inside another’s experience. With any luck, more filmmakers of all stripes can emulate this success story, and “Moonlight” portends good things for the future of queer cinema. —JDFrom its clever premise to the bloodshed of its Grand Guignol finale, Jordan Peele’s sledgehammer of a response to the illusion of a “post-racial” America felt like a direct provocation that was somehow detonated across the entire country at once. It helped, of course, that “Get Out” was released just a few short months after the 2016 election, as the film’s timeliness helped it to assume even greater levels of urgency; and, for Black audiences, new degrees of knowing catharsis. They were treated to a movie that was effectively “Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song” (the other Black man who got away!) for a new generation. There was some concern for whether white audiences would be able to identify with a movie in which every white character was utterly evil and dies gruesomely. But audiences of all shades were more than ready. America has long found it awkward to talk about race, but it certainly was not awkward to talk about “Get Out.” —TO“America needs to have a national conversation about race,” is a cliched cris de coeur, given that it’s never happened, and probably never will. Justin Simien’s series, based on his critically-acclaimed 2014 feature debut of the same name, tries, diving headfirst into the complexities of race in America, even though it’s not always successful. But the attempt is more than admirable. Following the lives of a diverse group of college students (most of them Black), contending with microaggressions and outright racism at a fictional, predominantly white Ivy League school, it skewers the mythical idea of a “post-racial” America that many bought into after the election of Obama. Its biting humor and candor likely won’t be for the easily flustered. —TOIn one early scene in Virgil Williams and Dee Rees’ sprawling adaptation of Hillary Jordan’s post-World War II southern novel, Ronsel Jackson (“Straight Outta Compton” star Jason Mitchell) leaves home to join the Army as his mother Florence (Mary J. Blige) turns her back as he departs. Rees was inspired by her paternal grandmother, who thought it bad luck to watch someone going away. Looking to her grandmother’s diaries, writer-director Rees shifted the script’s focus from the white family of Memphis imports Henry and Laura McAllan (Jason Clarke and Carey Mulligan) to a balanced two-family drama with “Pariah” star Rob Morgan and a reluctantly makeup-free Blige as the parents whose family has worked the land for generations. Rees embraced the book’s multiple narrators, lacing the two families into a complex tapestry. For a period epic of scale and scope, the $11.8 million budget was tight — especially when it had to accommodate two days in Hungary, complete with tanks and airplanes. The rest of the 26-day shoot was filmed on location in Louisiana. The film earned four Oscar nominations including Supporting Actress, Adapted Screenplay, Original Song, and the first ever for a woman cinematographer, Rachel Morrison. —ATThe American justice system absolutely failed 16-year-old Kalief Browder, a Black teen who spent three years in Rikers Island, awaiting a trial that never came to be, after being arrested for allegedly stealing a backpack — an accusation that was never proven. He spent two of those years in solitary confinement, which is as inhumane as any sort of imprisonment can get. The case was never prosecuted, the charges were ultimately dropped, and after he was finally released, the young man died by suicide. His story and the questions it raised are central to this six-part documentary series that reviews the case exhaustively, to make a statement about the long history of tragic trials of Black men who enter a criminal justice system in desperate need of reform. —TOThe Marvel Cinematic Universe films generally range from “not bad” to “quite good,” but “Black Panther” is one of the few in the series likely to be remembered as genuinely groundbreaking. Besides being the first superhero movie nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars — and besides featuring one of the final performances of the great Chadwick Boseman, who died of cancer two years after the film’s debut — “Black Panther” is the rare blockbuster that leans into the thorny questions raised by its story. The plot sees T’Challa (Boseman), the super-powered king of the sheltered African nation of Wakanda, reckoning with the revolutionary outsider Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), who thinks the country’s copious resources should be widely shared. Directed and co-written by Ryan Coogler, “Black Panther” features an eclectic cast of characters, elaborate art direction, and memorable action sequences, all put in service to what turns out to be an impassioned debate over the benefits and drawbacks of isolationism. —NMThis ensemble drama about the world of New York’s ballroom subculture from the late ‘80s to early ‘90s made IndieWire’s list of the Most Essential LGBTQ TV of the 21st Century. Michaela Jaé Rodriguez leads the series as Blanca, the leader of House Evangelista who guides the other members through personal crises and the evolving HIV crisis. It’s groundbreaking work in terms of trans representation on TV; “Pose” featured five trans women of color (Rodriguez, Dominique Jackson, Indya Moore, Hailie Sahar, and Angelica Ross) in central roles, and gives them the opportunity to be kind, mean, messy, magnificent, and most importantly, human. The show’s exploration into ballroom culture and Black life is unapologetic and uninterested in hand-holding straight, white audiences, and its portrayal of how the queer community navigated the AIDS crisis is alternatively heartbreaking and life-affirming. —WCMaking waves when it was initially banned in its home country, this tender queer romance pulses with bright colors and the electric butterflies of young love. “Rafiki” follows two teens, Kena (Samantha Mugatsia) and Ziki (Sheila Munyiva), who crush on each other despite their families’ political rivalry. When love blossoms between them, they must contend with small-town busybodies and the judgment of their conservative society. Boasting nuanced performances from the two charismatic newcomers, Wanuri Kahiu’s assured debut feature is an important reminder of the struggle many still face to live out and proud. The first Kenyan film to play Cannes, Kahiu won a landmark court case that earned the film an Oscar-qualifying theatrical run, chipping away at Kenyan anti-LGBT legislation in the process. “Rafiki” is political filmmaking at its most crucial. —JDPotentially the strangest entry on this list, Boots Riley’s directorial debut “Sorry to Bother You” is, in its director’s words, an “absurdist dark comedy with aspects of magical realism and science fiction inspired by the world of telemarketing.” And yet, that really only scratches the surface of what this movie’s about. Filled with an incredibly talented cast led by Lakeith Stanfield and Tessa Thompson, the film centers around Stanfield’s Cash, a young Black telemarketer who adopts a white accent to succeed at his job. This is before the film becomes a parable of corporate greed, a biting commentary on income inequality and modern-day slavery, and a wild absurdist romp along the boulevard of genetic manipulation. In the end, however, what makes this film so special is Riley’s uniquely singular vision. It’s no exaggeration to state that there is no other movie quite like “Sorry to Bother You.” —LAGHBO’s adaptation of “Watchmen” was opening up audiences’ eyes from its first episode, detailing the 1921 Tulsa race massacre that is now the subject of a few documentaries being released this year. From that point the Regina King-starring series examined everything from the creation of superheroes and why they tend to be overwhelmingly white, to the subject of police brutality. The series would go on to win 11 Primetime Emmys.—KL  Much like the Kalief Browder story, the so-called “Central Park Five” was another judicial travesty, although its ending wasn’t as tragic. Korey Wise, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam, and Raymond Santana Jr. were victims of the same morally bankrupt system. New York City’s criminal justice apparatus implemented a desperate scheme to ensure that the crime was solved swiftly, regardless of evidence, and these five boys became unwitting pawns in service of that end. Convicted long before the trial by a city blinded by fear and equally weighed with racial conflict, they were the children of Reagan’s “welfare queens” in the early 1980s, who became “wilding” youth later in the decade, and eventually Hillary Clinton’s “super-predators” in the early 1990s. These are all terms that belong to a library of racialized dog whistles that evoked moral panic, thrust back into the spotlight during the Obama and Trump presidential years. —TOWriter-director Channing Godfrey Peoples’ feature directorial debut, “Miss Juneteenth,” follows a working-class African American single mother, and former beauty queen, named Turquoise (Nicole Beharie), who wants nothing more than for her daughter to also wear the crown. Offering an atypical perspective of a beauty pageant, the film unfolds against the background of the Miss Juneteenth procession, named after the Juneteenth holiday. For many young Black women, the Miss Juneteenth pageant is their version of the more recognized Miss America, and the film foregrounds this narrative from the POV of a woman rarely given as much screen consideration. A rare feature film written and directed by a Black woman, telling a Black woman’s story, “Miss Juneteenth” is at once familiar as a story about mothers and daughters, but it also feels fresh and authentic. It breaks stereotypes and instead presents Black women who are attempting to liberate themselves and move towards a greater self-awareness. —TOThe series observes American history through the lens of the evolution of African American cuisine, or what’s more commonly referred to as “soul food.” This century has witnessed a growing selection of art that serves as correctives to the “American Narrative” by amplifying the contributions of people of color. An example would be a film like “Hidden Figures” (2016). “High on the Hog” does the same in documentary series form, centering a key aspect of Black cultural identity (cuisine) as a foundation of American history that emerged on the African continent, and, because of the transatlantic slave trade, would eventually blend with Western culinary traditions to become what is appreciated widely today. It’s a fresh perspective, as well as a nuanced exploration of the generally unacknowledged contributions of Africans in America. —TOHow best should we remember the dead? The critical African American history retold in Margaret Brown’s imperative film, “Descendant,” an unblinking investigation combining local stories with “Erin Brockovich” flair, seeks to answer that question. Because for the many Black folks living in Africatown, Alabama, where the last slave ship made landfall, remembering is what they do best. Read IndieWire’s complete review of Descendant by Robert Daniels.The watery misery of Nikyatu Jusu’s soul-stirring feature debut comes in literal waves. A trickle of water felt in a dream soon spills into sinking tragedy as Senegalese immigrant Aisha (Anna Diop, purposeful and ferocious) gets sucked down an understated spiral of suspense, dread, and dark magic in New York City. “Nanny” quickly lets us know something is wrong in Aisha’s new world, where she babysits for a toxic family helmed by the manipulative Amy (a razor-sharp Michelle Monaghan) and her lecherous husband Adam (Morgan Spector).But the subsequent steady creep proves the ideal pace for Jusu to build up to her final-act heartbreaker. Aisha’s romance with the handsome Mailk (Sinqua Walls) and her longing for her son Lamine (Jahleel Kamara) back in Senegal, are the weights that submerge us in the pain of this singular final girl a woman ultimately drowned in the devastation of a terror she can’t see coming. —AF“The Woman King,” while based on a lesser-known segment of West African history during a decidedly fraught time in history, makes for a hell of a time at the movies, a seemingly “niche” topic with great appeal, the sort of battle-heavy feature that will likely engender plenty of hoots and hollers. And if it seems a bit Hollywood-ized, complete with glossy twists and a touch of the soap operatic to boot, perhaps that’s part of what makes it so special. You’ve never seen a movie about this that looks, well, so funnily familiar. If that’s what it took to get made, so be it. In this climate, in this world, stories like this are too precious and special to stay hidden. Bring them into the light. —KE",

        "title": "When Pixar and DC Failed to Be Sure Things and Wes Anderson Broke Box-Office Records",
        "content": "In theory, the Father’s Day weekend and Juneteenth holiday could boost Sunday’s grosses enough to prevent this weekend from falling below last year’s performance. However, even if that’s the case — and in all likelihood, it’s not — that’s a hell of a note when you’re looking at the debut of two new films from prime franchises, each costing over $200 million, and some vital holdovers.For once, genuine joy can be found in specialized releasing. Wes Anderson’s “Asteroid City” (Focus) has a post-COVID best opening of $790,000 in just six theaters. With a per-theater average of $131,667, that’s the best of the year. (In recent history, it’s hard to find another film that did as well.) The slow expansion of “Past Lives” (A24), now in 85 theaters, added another $761,000. At this point, it has an impressive PTA of nearly $9,000 and $1.9 million to date.Based on adequate-at-best tracking for “The Flash” (Warner Bros. Discovery) and “Elemental” (Disney), we hoped for a minimum weekend of $200 million for all films. Current estimate is around $167 million.It’s easy to blame the franchises: Both DC Comics (“Black Adam”) and Pixar (“Lightyear”) recently fell short (although even those had better openings). There’s also the unique challenge of “The Flash” lead Ezra Miller absenting himself from all promotion and Pixar’s recovery from being perceived as a streaming property rather than a theatrical one.However, a more existential concern may be to blame. Studios now spend $200 million-$300 million on what appear to be safe, audience-proven projects — only to find that an increasingly picky public, perhaps in response to our always-on entertainment industrial complex, has become increasingly expert at ignoring the hype.Under James Gunn, a full-scale revamp is underway at DC. But how different can it really be? (On June 16, WBD announced that “The Flash” director Andy Muschietti will helm the latest “Batman” reboot.) Whether it’s Marvel or DC, comic-book success is no longer a given and that makes it harder to justify individual production and marketing investments that easily exceed $300 million.Pixar no longer defines animated success, although it consistently makes the most expensive animated films. The top hits of the year to date, animated or otherwise, are Universal’s Illumination production “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” and Sony’s Marvel title “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.” They’re made and marketed as fun-first movies, something that Pixar seems to have lost.The summer still has more than two months to go with several potential hits ahead, but it’s become increasingly unlikely that a domestic $400 million release will be among them. Our best hope lies once again with Tom Cruise and the new “Mission: Impossible” film.This weekend’s openers did succeed in stealing market share from holdovers, with “Spider-Verse” and “The Little Mermaid” each falling by 50 percent. Last weekend’s No. 1 title, “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” dropped 67 percent for fourth place and only $20 million.“Spider-Verse” is a hit; “Mermaid” has a credible domestic performance; “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” will be profitable if unimpressive. As for everything else — “Fast X,” “Transformers,” weak foreign for “Mermaid,” “Elemental” — this summer is seeing many sure-thing movies that aren’t.For theaters, that may be enough for now. The summer remains 6 percent ahead of last year, with several promising July releases including the new “Indiana Jones” (another $300 million production). Year to date is now 23 percent ahead of 2022 (if that holds, a $9.1 billion year). The rolling four-week comparison to 2019 remains excellent at 98 percent, but that will drop; Summer 2019 saw three huge releases open later than June 18.The problem is to get to this level, studios need to continue to expend on films or try to figure out how to spend less and still have appeal. Add the WGA strike, and reaction to these weak results could result in a weakened pipeline ahead.With the Juneteenth holiday on Monday, Lionsgate released their Tim Story comedy acquisition “The Blackening” to $6 million. They acquired the Toronto-premiered horror comedy for $5 million, with additional marketing expenses. It placed No. 6. “Adipurush,” an Indian epic released in two languages, came in No. 9 with $2.5 million in 960 theaters.Wes Anderson’s latest bested another Anderson’s platform best (Paul Thomas, for “Licorice Pizza”) by a significant distance. This Anderson has a track record for opening strong. His three prior films were Searchlight titles with some level of initial limited release. His last film to open only in New York/Los Angeles was “The Grand Budapest Hotel” in 2014, which (with lower ticket prices) opened to $811,000 in four theaters.Much has changed in exhibition since then, including the loss of two major Los Angeles venues. “Asteroid City” also faces the challenge of getting enough seats in other theaters in a crowded week, along with decent but less exuberant reviews. That makes this weekend’s performance even more outstanding than figures suggest.Anderson’s film expands nationwide to around 1,500 theaters next week. Audiences may not respond at “Budapest” levels (it grossed $173 million worldwide), but this debut is a victory for the concept of initial platform play — and for “Asteroid City” distributor Focus Features.1.

        "title": "Jack Kirby’s Son Calls Out ‘Stan Lee’ Disney+ Documentary for Minimizing Father’s Contributions",
        "content": "Stan Lee‘s legendary career as a Marvel Comics writer is the subject of a glowing new documentary produced by the company that now owns his most iconic characters. “Stan Lee” began streaming on Disney+ on Friday following its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival, and diehard Marvel fans have praised David Gelb’s film for paying tribute to a man who is synonymous with comic books. But others have criticized the film for oversimplifying a nuanced story.Neal Kirby, the son of Lee’s longtime partner Jack Kirby, took to his daughter’s Twitter account on Saturday to release a statement condemning what he sees as the film’s omission of his father’s contributions. While Lee and Kirby are credited as co-creating most of their iconic characters, comic industry observers have long wondered if Lee’s media persona led to him getting a larger share of the credit than he deserved. Neal Kirby accused the documentary of perpetuating that narrative.“I understand that, as a ‘documentary about Stan Lee,’ most of the narrative is in his voice, literally and figuratively,” Kirby wrote. “It’s not any big secret that there has always been controversy over the parts that were played in the creation and success of Marvel’s characters. Stan Lee had the fortunate circumstance to have access to the corporate megaphone and media, and he used these to create his own mythos as to the creation of the Marvel character pantheon. He made himself the voice of Marvel. So, for several decades he was the ‘only’ man standing, and blessed with a long life, the last man standing (my father died in 1994).”He continued, “Are we to assume Lee had a hand in creating every Marvel character? Are we to assume that it was never the other cocreator that walked into Lee’s office and said, ‘Stan I have a great idea for a character!’ According to Lee, it was always his idea. Lee spends a fair amount of time talking about how and why he created the Fantastic Four, with only one fleeting reference to my father.”Kirby also took a jab at Lee’s intelligence, saying that his father was more well-rounded and infused his comics with context that Lee would have been incapable of adding.“It should be noted and is generally accepted that Stan Lee had a limited knowledge of history, mythology, or science.” he wrote. “On the other hand, my father’s knowledge of these subjects, to which I and many others can personally attest, was extensive. Einstein summed it up better; ‘More the knowledge, lesser the ego. Lesser the knowledge, more the ego.’”",

        "content": "The 2004 film “Spartan” has largely been forgotten, but the thriller will always have a place in history as the movie that made Val Kilmer hate David Mamet.A viral Twitter thread has sparked renewed interest in the film’s DVD commentary track, in which Kilmer repeatedly insults his director Mamet for what Kilmer saw as pompous and occasionally abusive on-set behavior. The film, which centers around a search for the President’s kidnapped daughter, was the first collaboration between Mamet and Kilmer. Based on the actor’s comments, it’s not surprising that it ended up being their last.“He’s cruel,” Kilmer said of Mamet. “He hates actors, having failed at the profession himself. There were a lot of tears on the set. It was tough, because you’d be playing a tough guy and he’d break you down. But in front of everyone too, he wouldn’t do it in the trailer. I hate him.”In addition to his personal grievances, Kilmer also said that he disagrees with the playwright-turned-director’s artistic choices.“He writes in a lot of particular and sometimes complicated rhythms,” he said. “That’s why it’s so frustrating when he cuts all the good stuff. He messes up his own rhythm. I don’t understand him, except that he needs help.”Kilmer frequently criticized Mamet for surrounding himself on set with friends who would never disagree with him. The actor said that his frustration with Mamet’s nepotism reached a boiling point when he had to act alongside Mamet’s rabbi in a key scene.“That’s David’s rabbi,” he said. “I’m not even kidding. It sounds like I’m kidding, but that guy I just shot is David’s rabbi. See that’s what I mean by ‘sick.’ I wouldn’t have him shoot my practitioner in my film. Why does he have me shoot his rabbi? And why is his rabbi Irish?”Kilmer claims that Mamet was so concerned about his perception among the crew that his assistant produced and distributed a weekly newsletter documenting the director’s best moments on set.“We had a thing called the Spartan Times, which was a newsletter produced every week by David’s assistant, basically to make David look good in front of the crew. So she would follow him around and write down any humorous thing he said, or make up stuff that she could attribute to David.”While many of Kilmer’s critiques of Mamet point to deep character flaws, he also found time to take superficial jabs at Mamet’s appearance.“What I find amazing is his courage,” he said. “To still wear a beret in 2004, you gotta have guts.”Watch the entire thread of Kilmer’s complaints about Mamet below.",

        "title": "Johnny Depp Says He Felt ‘Exposed’ at Cannes: ‘People Can Hit the Bottom Many Times’",
        "content": "The 76th annual Cannes Film Festival got off to a controversial start when Maïwenn’s “Jeanne du Barry” played as the opening night selection last month. The period piece, which features Johnny Depp in a supporting role as French monarch Louis XV alongside Maïwenn’s eponymous protagonist, attracted as much attention for its cast’s personal lives as its artistic merit.The film marks Depp’s first major acting role in years, following his acrimonious defamation lawsuit against Amber Heard and widespread reporting about unprofessional behavior on movie sets. His director and co-star also found herself in the headlines before the film’s premiere for assaulting a journalist at a restaurant in France.The film premiered to moderate reviews and eventually secured an American distribution deal from Vertical. Depp’s colorful press conference at the festival attracted plenty of attention, and film industry observers have begun to speculate about the actor making a larger Hollywood comeback in the near future.A new behind-the-scenes Instagram video released by photographer Greg Williams shows Depp getting ready for his Cannes appearance and opening up about the experience of returning to the storied festival.“Walking up the steps at the thing, I’ve done it a few times with different films over many years,” Depp said of returning to Cannes. “It’s quite beautiful, when you’re at the receiving end, you just feel like, initially you feel fucking exposed.”Depp continued to push back against the notion that his return to acting is a “comeback,” saying that he never attempted to leave Hollywood despite the hit that his reputation took.“I mean, you call it whatever you want, you could make it whatever you want but comeback? I mean, you have to go away to come back,” Depp said. “I didn’t go nowhere. Maybe I was not thought of or looked at or allowed to be looked at.”The actor explained that he was well aware of the way his recent scandals have impacted the public’s perception of him, but expressed confidence in his ability to continually bounce back from his failures.“People can hit the bottom many times,” he said. “You can drop straight to the bottom a billion fucking times, but if you’re lucky enough to find the basement, you’re alright, you know?”",

        "content": "Without question, one of the most thrilling aspects of DC’s “The Flash” is the reappearance of Michael Keaton as Batman after a 31-year hiatus from the role, something that was as exciting for the film‘s director as it is for the audience. “I was a teenager when the Tim Burton movie came out and I was blown away by it,” Andy Muschietti told IndieWire’s Filmmaker Toolkit podcast. “I was very attracted to the idea of finding Bruce Wayne 30 years later and fantasizing what his life would have been.”Bringing back Keaton’s iteration of Wayne as created by the actor and Tim Burton in the 1989 “Batman” raised a key question for Muschietti: How much should he carry over from the Burton “Batman” films and where did he want to strike out in his own directions? “The insertion of that story set up big questions,” Muschietti said. “How closely do we abide by the aesthetics and the tone?” Some choices were dictated by Muschietti’s desire to make “The Flash” a more grounded comic book movie than Burton’s films. “One thing I knew for sure is that I didn’t want to emulate the cinematography of the earlier movies, because the level of fantasy in the design would be prohibitive.”Yet Muschietti did want to create a convincing evolution for Keaton’s character from 1992 to 2023, which meant tweaking various designs from the earlier movies. “I tried to blend the worlds and reach a balance where it’s still believable that Michael Keaton exists in this timeline,” Muschietti said, noting that one of his first steps was to run his ideas about the character by Keaton. “There was a lot of talk about what happened to Bruce, why do we find him the way that we find him? The reason why he quit being Batman was very important to me.” In fact, there was more material relating to Wayne’s journey in the original cut, but Muschietti took it out for pacing. “It’s a very revealing and important scene, and you’ll see it in the extras on the DVD,” Muschietti said.The history Muschietti and Keaton discussed found its way into every element of the production and costume design when it came to Wayne Manor and Batman’s outfits and props. “I didn’t want to find Bruce Wayne in the same spot where we left him 30 years ago,” Muschietti said. “I wanted to create a backstory where he continued being Batman for a few more years, hence the new gadgets and technology. The suit is slightly different, the Batwing is different — it’s a three-seater now and has new rotating technology — everything looks like the designs from the Tim Burton movies, but slightly altered. I just had fun exploring it.”",

        "title": "‘The Flash’ Post-Credits Scene Hints at Which Other Superhero Might Still Have a Place in a Changing DC Universe",
        "content": "[Editor’s note: The following post contains spoilers for both “The Flash” and its post-credits scene.]Ah, the superhero movie post-credits scene. As the ever-evolving world of comic book cinematic universes has only grown over the past few years (important count notation: we’re currently at 32 released Marvel Cinematic Universe features, and 14 DC Extended Universe features, with plenty more to come), so too has the post-credits tag.Once just a frisky and fun add-on, post-credits scenes are now tasked with serving a wide number of functions, from setting up a sequel to unveiling new heroes and fresh villains, to the point that even when a film doesn’t include a post-credits tag, it’s worth noting.And now, something else entirely: the end of Andy Muschietti’s extremely buzzy and oft-delayed “The Flash” film doesn’t just set up what’s next for this standalone series, but hints at what’s to come for the wider DC film slate, which is currently in a state of profound flux and change. It’s not just the film’s sole post-credits scene on the hook to deliver that information either, it’s also the film’s final scene itself, which sets up a slew of queries about the future of the DC multiverse itself.[One more warning: The following post contains spoilers for both “The Flash” and its post-credits scene.]As Variety reported earlier this month, the secrecy surrounding the film’s final scene and its post-credits sequence was not just a product of Warner Bros. wanting to keep some fun surprises under wraps, but was also rooted in a desire for flexibility surrounding the future of the franchise. The outlet reported that “at the height of [star Ezra] Miller’s PR problems, Warners was looking to keep its options open with regards to the future trajectory of the speedster.” In short, just how much was that ending going to nod at more adventures to come? And, even if Miller seems locked to return for more films, which other DC superhero would be joining them for the ride?Per that Variety story, the film’s final scene was “changed multiple times” before it screened at CinemaCon in April, and “the version that screened at CinemaCon in April ended abruptly, with a chunk of the final scene missing. At screenings on the Burbank lot this week, the final scene was intact, but Warners blurred out key elements.” Muschietti’s film ends with Miller’s Barry Allen (aka The Flash) pleased after seemingly a) setting the multiverse back to “normal,” after the film’s time-bending adventure that sees the superhero altering multiple timelines after he discovers he can literally run fast enough to go back in time and b) celebrating the release of his beloved father (Ron Livingston) after one tiny tweak Barry did make in the past helps exonerate him in the “current day.”But, as we learn during the course of the film — mostly, care of Michael Keaton’s Batman, who appears as just one of the many changes to Barry’s “normal” timeline after he goes back in time (in his timeline, it’s Ben Affleck who plays the Caped Crusader) — screwing up time has plenty of unintended consequences, the kind that go forward and backward. So when a very happy Barry emerges from the local courthouse and gets a call from “Bruce Wayne,” he’s excited to see his usual pal: but it’s George Clooney (like Keaton, another former Batman star) who pulls up to greet his pal. Oops!Early screenings of the film that did include its final moments blurred out the appearance of Clooney as Bruce Wayne/Batman. Audience members knew some Batman was arriving, and that his appearance shocked Barry (who yelps, “Who the fuck is this?” when the hero gets out of his vehicle), but it was unclear which Batman was on deck.Clooney is not the only DC hero who appears in the film’s final moments, though it’s unclear how much of a part he’ll play in the series going forward (it seems more likely that The Flash’s next adventure will involve setting right the timeline and getting Affleck back, though the actor has been publicly disinterested in returning to the role, so maybe we get lots more Clooney, and maybe we get somehow entirely new). But there’s one person that DC seems ready to announce is very much part of the future of the franchise (alongside Miller), and that’s the hero who shows up in the film’s lone post-credits scene: Jason Momoa.During “The Flash,” once Barry is tossed into a new timeline, he sets about tracking down the rest of the Justice League, at least as he knows it. He can’t find Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (star Gal Gadot appears in an early scene of the film, FYI), soon learns that Victor Prince (Ray Fisher) has not become Cyborg, and even realizes that Momoa’s Arthur Curry wasn’t even born (and thus his Aquaman does not exist). Bruce Wayne/Batman is, of course, now Michael Keaton. And Superman? He never made it to Earth, but his cousin Kara Zor-El (Sasha Calle) did.In his somewhat-back-to-normal timeline, Barry does find Arthur, aka Aquaman, who seems to have spent most of his adult life getting drunk in dive bars. Barry attempts to explain to Arthur the ins and outs of the multiverse — like that there’s always a Bruce Wayne/Batman, though he’s different people throughout each timeline — but Arthur is too drunk (and, understandably, too confused) to truly process what his young friend is telling him. Instead, he splashes out in a big puddle (it’s “his home”!), tells Barry to take his “Atlantean treasure” (a ring) to get more beer, and passes out.It’s short and funny, but it also establishes that Miller remains The Flash, Momoa is back in the fold as Aquaman, and they’re seemingly going to be going on some further multiverse-spanning adventures together, and soon. All that, in less than a minute!A Warner Bros. release, “The Flash″ is now in theaters.",

        "title": "‘Fresh Kills’ Review: Jennifer Esposito’s Mafia Drama Puts the Women in the Spotlight",
        "content": "Watch the canon of classic American mob movies, and you’ll be constantly reminded that families — both kinds of them — stick together. The Vito Corleones and Tony Sopranos of the world are quick to justify the formation of their crime organizations by saying that Italians had to look out for each other when they immigrated to this country with nothing. And they’ll defend their continued shady dealings by saying that they do it all for their wives and children. Crime might be the lifeblood of their communities, but what really matters (in their view) is that mob families always take care of each other.Of course, the stories never end as happily as they begin. The sacred bonds of family rarely survive the stresses posed by greed, law enforcement, and the massive egos this line of work attracts. Sometimes, all it takes is a guy named Big Sam making a disrespectful comment about his cousin’s new boat to start a massacre that brings a family to its knees.The takeaway is often that if you invite evil into your life, it eventually becomes impossible to leave it at work. When a gangster survives long enough to see his idyllic home life ruined by his own bad decisions, there’s always a regretful moment where he looks back at what could have been. But who’s to say that what could have been wasn’t also terrible?That’s the question that Jennifer Esposito seeks to explore in her directorial debut “Fresh Kills.” The ’80s-set period piece follows the wife and two daughters of a Staten Island mob boss as they navigate the material comforts and unspoken expectations that come with living in the male-dominated world of organized crime. Esposito skillfully steers the story away from tired stereotypes we’ve seen before, like the “mob wife” seething at home while her husband cheats or the daughters who live in fear of a violent father. Instead, the film takes a nuanced look at the existential anxiety that can haunt the women in this world when things are going (relatively) well.The Larusso family thought moving from Brooklyn to a palatial McMansion in Staten Island would be a fresh start. They’d get more space, the kids could attend a new school without fear of being bullied, and Francine (Esposito) would finally have the distance she requires to turn a blind eye to what her husband Joe (Domenick Lombardozzi) does to finance their lives. But when Francine arrives and sees that Joe omitted a key detail from the pitch — they now live next door to his mob associate Nello (Stelio Savante) — she realizes that nobody can run far enough to escape the ugly realities of this life.That’s the lesson she tries to teach her daughters Rose (Emily Bader) and Connie (Odessa A’zion) as they grow up in the shadow of the mafia. “Fresh Kills” spans most of their childhoods, beginning in the summer of 1987 and continuing through 1998. The large canvas allows us to watch as the two girls form their own wildly divergent opinions about the family business.Connie is endlessly loyal to her father and wildly appreciative of the lifestyle he provides her. She’s always quick to spring to his defense and even quicker to marry a young gangster and embrace life as a mob wife. Rose approaches things differently. She can see that there’s life beyond Staten Island, and she allows herself to entertain dreams of going to cosmetology school and hosting a TV show about beauty. When her father showers her with gifts — like buying a bakery for her to run without ever asking if she was interested — they feel like golden chains tying her to a life that she isn’t sure she wants.Francine exists somewhere between the two, as if she entered life with Rose’s idealism and eventually resigned herself to Connie’s pragmatism. She’s loyal to a fault but often quietly supportive of Rose’s larger ambitions despite making a point of discouraging her. Esposito gives an incredible performance as a protective mother who has decided to live life without questioning the choices that she’s made, even if a part of her knows they might have been the wrong ones.“Fresh Kills” is at its best when it explores the complicated nuances of mob life through small, everyday moments between Francine and her daughters. But the major plot points that comprise the skeleton of the story often veer into melodrama that isn’t executed quite as sharply. At certain points the film seems unsure of what it wants to be, injecting its straightforward ’80s production design and cinematography with more expressionistic “indie film moments” that pull away from the larger story. (There’s the artful shot of someone yelling with glee on an empty street at night.)But occasional stylistic incoherence never derails the film because the emotional core of Francine, Connie, and Rose is so strong. Esposito portrays the three women with the kind of depth that’s normally reserved for male mob bosses, and she repeatedly proves that their decisions are every bit as complicated as trying to decide who to whack. The three actresses give deeply human performances that should remind everyone that the invisible women that these movies love to sideline are more than capable of anchoring their own stories.“Fresh Kills” premiered at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "title": "The A.I. Language in DGA’s Deal Is Stronger Than You Think, but Not as Strong as You’d Like",
        "content": "DGA members have until June 23 to vote on the tentative agreement with the studios that passed early this month. Ratifying the deal is no slam dunk, and one line about A.I. could crater the whole thing.“Employers may not use [generative AI] in connection with creative elements without consultation with the Director or other DGA-covered employees,” the tentative agreement reads. The use of the word “consultation” just hangs in the air.Some directors guild members have called that language “weak” and “dangerous.” Probably most nervous are DGA members who are also in the still-striking writers guild, the WGA.“The Matrix” director Lilly Wachowski said the DGA-AMPTP’s legalese “has a stink of deviousness.” “Law & Order: SVU” showrunner Warren Leight said on Twitter he’s been around long enough to know that taking the studio’s word on that whole “consultation” thing doesn’t mean much.The trouble is, there is no single, consistent definition for what such a “consultation” actually means. So we asked the only folks who could make sense of such a thing: entertainment lawyers.“It’s more than a notification but considerably less than an approval,” Simon Pulman, who is a partner and co-chair of Pryor Cashman’s media and entertainment groups, told IndieWire. “The studio or the producer would have to tell the director of their plan to use generative AI, and would have to give them the opportunity to air their thoughts and feelings about that. But there’s no requirements within that to actually engage with that feedback.”So the studio or producer can’t just drop the director a text or an email about planned usage of AI and call it a day. They must engage in good faith. But it doesn’t mean the director gets the final say — or veto power — on the matter.It’s understandable that some directors, writers, and especially director-writers want more than that. Ivy Kagan Bierman, Loeb & Loeb partner and the chair of the Entertainment Labor Group, sees “consultation” as a stand-in for “compromise,” which she called “very meaningful.”“If the DGA agreement said that the companies simply had to notify the directors that they were going to be using AI in connection with the creative elements, that would be a much bigger issue because the directors would have no involvement whatsoever in that decision making,” she told IndieWire. “The purpose of that consultation is to be meaningful, is to take into consideration the director’s perspective, the director’s notes and comments, and then to make decisions in part based upon that consultation with the director.”Kagan Bierman, Pulman, and one DGA-WGA member who spoke with IndieWire on the condition of anonymity all agree on one thing: thank goodness the agreement defines AI as not being a person.“I was really pleasantly relieved to see them willing to say on the record that AI is not a person and that people are required for these jobs,” the DGA-WGA member told IndieWire. “I know that sounds like a really dumb thing. But that really was an existential dread that everybody was feeling because of a lack of responsibility to the writer at all in terms of engaging them on those issues.”Pulman may not be as optimistic as our DGA-WGA member, but he offered up another silver lining that hinges on Hollywood being a relationship business: If a studio wants to keep working with an A-list director, they better not finish his or her film with Midjourney. The bad news? Not every director has such status.Worse yet? Even some AI advocates think the DGA deal’s language is soft. Edward Saatchi of The CultureDAO, which represents a collective of filmmakers telling stories with AI (without the aid of studios), believes directors deserve more autonomy than the pending agreement gives them.“That is the bare minimum, and we can all go much further for a kind of technology that is very disturbing to people,” Saatchi told IndieWire. “One would hope it would be a director-led process, rather than the producer checking in with the director, the director having the power to figure out how to use generative AI for those who are making entirely AI movies. That probably is too weak and artists should have more control.”When reached, here’s what a DGA rep had to say: The language with AI also applies to previously codified language surrounding the consultation over creative elements such as a director’s cut, as spelled out in section 7-202 of the DGA’s 2020 basic agreement, which requires employers to give good faith consideration to the director’s advice and suggestion. The spokesperson declined to comment further.We’ll find out in one week if the language was good enough for the (majority of) directors. Regardless, the writers see a reason to continue holding out: AI threatens to impact writing credits more so than it threatens to hurt directors. The WGA maintains its own fight is not tied to the DGA’s — or to SAG-AFRTA’s, for that matter. Pulman says he gets it, though he believes the DGA’s language will still be “helpful” for the WGA to build upon at the negotiating table.",

        "title": "‘Oppenheimer’ Could Open in Third Place, but It Might Not Matter",
        "content": "With “The Flash” (Warner Bros. Discovery) taking in a promising $9.7 million in Thursday previews (hoping to reach $70 million) while “Elemental” (Disney) grossed only $2.4 million, this weekend is perhaps the summer’s most critical for two of the brands that define franchise filmmaking.However compelling those results might be, we’re already distracted by the upcoming drama of July 21, opening date for both “Oppenheimer” (Universal) and “Barbie” (WBD) — and the battleground for ongoing IMAX screening of “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part 1” (Paramount), which opens the week prior. As box-office battles go, this one will be hard to beat in 2023.It’s too soon for audience tracking, but not to gauge industry expectations. There is a chance that the top three for the weekend of July 21 may be “Reckoning” #1, “Barbie” #2, and “Oppenheimer” #3 — but that would also be a misleading index. Here’s why.“Reckoning,” which moved to a Wednesday opening to gain two more days of IMAX and other premium play, could be the biggest hit of the summer with a potential five-day opening of over $125 million. Franchise popularity and expectations aside, star Tom Cruise has enormous credibility after the success of “Top Gun: Maverick.”That would suggest a second “Reckoning” weekend above $50 million at least — and less for “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie.” Industry sources suggest that “Barbie” has the edge and might ultimately be the bigger domestic success.Neither is a franchise film. “Oppenheimer” is a biopic about a scientist, played by respected actor-not-yet-movie-star Cillian Murphy. Its real star is director Christopher Nolan, and its appeal includes literally how much bang the director can get for $100 million bucks (along with potentially stellar critical reaction).“Barbie” is a comedy with primarily female appeal, with interest intense primarily from older and non-minority women. Director Greta Gerwig is two for two with “Lady Bird” and “Little Women,” neither of which were a guaranteed success. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling in the leads gives it greater star appeal than “Oppenheimer.”Each cost around $100 million. (“Reckoning” is reportedly close to $300 million.) Unlike “Reckoning,” these films will rely less on a huge opening; more important is initial reaction that generates word of mouth and sustains several weeks of impressive theatrical play.Driving Cruise’s drive to hold over IMAX screens is “Reckoning” needs multiple weeks of blockbuster performance to turn a profit. Without “Oppenheimer,” that would be a no-brainer… but Universal dated “Oppenheimer” when it announced the production in October 2020 and shooting with IMAX cameras guaranteed it would be an IMAX priority.Previous “Mission: Impossible” films opened in late summer and did well with late-summer openings, but with “Oppenheimer” locking up three weeks of IMAX screens, the placement may have been the best possible. Cruise’s intelligence is key to his longevity, but if he hoped last minute to shift this, that was not based on realism-based thinking.The IMAX advantage for “Oppenheimer” is a mixed blessing. It promises you must see it on the biggest possible screen to experience its full impact, but the limited number of premium-format screens are further constricted by the film’s three-hour run time. That will hurt its initial weekend gross even if many premium screens sell out all weekend.It would comfort Cruise if “Reckoning” took the #1 spot in its second weekend, but that is secondary to more important factors facing all three films: initial grosses, how they perform over multiple weeks, overseas grosses, and their relative budgets. Horse races are entertaining, but the ranking only provides bragging rights.",

        "content": "Diane Keaton still doesn’t know why she was cast in “The Godfather” more than a half-century after its release.The “Annie Hall” actress asked director Francis Ford Coppola via Instagram Stories, “Why on Earth did you choose me for ‘The Godfather’?!”Coppola replied, “I chose you, because although you were to play the more straight/vanilla wife, there was something about you, deeper, funnier, and very interesting. (I was right).”The auteur added that it was Keaton’s breakout performance in the musical “Hair” that in part convinced him to cast her.“I was invited by Fred Astaire to accompany him to see ‘Hair’ which he couldn’t make ‘hide nor hair’ out of,” Coppola wrote. “You were in it, and I remember your beautiful singing voice.”“The Godfather,” which celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2022, spurred two sequels, concluding with 1990’s “The Godfather: Part III.” Keaton, who portrayed Michael Coreleone’s (Al Pacino) wife Kay in all three films, reflected on what she believed was a box office disappointment of the third installment.“When I saw it way back, it was like ‘Oh, I don’t know.’ It didn’t seem to do that well and the reviews weren’t great,” Keaton recalled amid the 2022 recut. “But Francis restructured the beginning and the end and man, I’m telling you it worked.”Keaton’s co-star Pacino also has admitted that he was at first taken aback by the level of fame he reached following “The Godfather” films after “winning the lottery” of being cast in the lead.“How did they give him ‘The Godfather’?” Pacino said during a NYT interview reflecting on the movie’s anniversary. “It just seemed so outrageous. Here I am, talking to somebody who I think is flipped out. I said, ‘What train am I on? OK. Humor the guy.’ And he wanted me to do Michael. I thought, OK, I’ll go along with this. I said, ‘Yes, Francis, good.’ You know how they talk to you when you’re slipping? They say, ‘Yes! Of course! Yes!’ But he wasn’t. It was the truth. And then I was given the part.”He added, “‘The Godfather’ gave me a new identity that was hard for me to cope with. It’s a piece of work that I was so fortunate to be in. But it’s taken me a lifetime to accept it and move on. It’s not like I played Superman.”Film icons chatting thru the dm q&a box is why Instagram remains supreme @Diane_Keaton @coppolawine 🍷 pic.twitter.com/bU1p1QlMzt",

        "title": "Fire and Water Fall in Love in ‘Elemental’ — Here’s How Pixar Brought Their Romance to Life",
        "content": "[Editor’s note: The following interview contains spoilers.]After a disappointing premiere at Cannes, mixed reviews, and low box office forecasts (below $40 million), Pixar’s ambitious “Elemental” heads into theaters with a big question mark: Will audiences embrace this ultimate opposites-attract love story between Ember (Leah Lewis) and Wade (Mamoudou Athie)? After all, fire and water don’t mix. But director Peter Sohn built Pixar’s first rom-com around the very proposition that they can unite. That’s the whole point of this elaborate animated world and character building (as a tribute to his Korean parents’ immigrant story and his own mixed marriage). If fire and water can overcome their differences and co-exist, then so can humanity.“The first question was: If fire and water could even connect or fall in love,” Sohn told IndieWire. “And that was a promise to what this intimacy would be. So much of the development of this was us trying to understand how to use the effect [of these two elemental characters] in a cinematic way.”In their first iterations, Ember and Wade came off as superheroes, throwing their fire and water around as displays of energy (they represent Pixar’s first fully-simulated, volumetric characters in a joint collaboration between effects and animation). “Soon, very quickly, I found a connection through using the elements to reflect emotions,” added Sohn. “What do Wade’s bubbles feel like or Embers’ roiling? Does that feel like stress?“Once we got there, I felt like there was an opening for us to understand how these characters could begin to connect,” he continued. “Something that was different for me in terms of other movies that I’d worked on here was: It wasn’t just a buddy film about miscommunication, these two characters had holes in them and trying to understand how they fill each other up was the first journey.”But understanding the chemistry between Ember and Wade proved difficult before resolving their identities: She has anger management issues and he has his own unresolved emotional issues. “Ember, as our main protagonist, was trying to figure out where she belonged, how the burden of her family sat on her,” Sohn said. “And because she didn’t belong, that sort of created a wall in her. I mean, her hole really was about something subconscious in there.”As for Wade, his “being so much of a high IQ and being so emotional, became this mirror character, meaning he was gonna reflect Ember, but also become that safe place for Ember to become vulnerable. It helped us understand how they were gonna be intimate.”A memorable moment reveals great intimacy when Wade sneaks Ember into an underwater garden so she can finally see her favorite flower, the Vivisteria, which has remained elusive since childhood because of fire restriction laws.“It starts out as a spark for her,” Sohn continued, “but it also becomes a concept of her identity. And it really tied to my experience of trying to understand: Am I Korean or am I American? And that hyphenation started to layer into the little bubble that protects Ember underwater. It helps her heal some of the xenophobia that happens to her, which totally connects to identity when someone tells you that you don’t belong.”In fact, “Elemental” took a dark turn early in production with the passing of Sohn’s father. He was so grief-stricken that he made Ember a much angrier character. (Later, toward the end of production, his mother passed away as well.) “She was really, really angry and blew up a building, and her father became a pariah,” he said. “When everyone [at Pixar] saw this version, they knew what I was going through. And they asked if this is what I originally wanted to do? I was like, ‘No, I always wanted something more hopeful.'”But the greatest challenge was figuring out their first touch and the chemical reaction that it stirred in both of them. “There was so much tension of what this contact was, the fear that they could be killing each other,” said Sohn. “It was one of the first things that I boarded on the show. This is not old love, this is new love. So there was the external part, but then there was also trying to reflect that they wanted to connect. What is this chemistry? Is it magnetic, electrical? This boiling, this roiling?”For Sohn, this directly ties the emotional and visual appeal of “Elemental.” It’s both an intimate and epic spectacle. Yet it’s a nervous time for Pixar, given last year’s box office failure of “Lightyear,” which marked its first theatrical release coming out of the pandemic. The studio aims to remind audiences of its special animation brand with this original movie that deserves to be experienced in theaters as much as “Spider-Man: Across the Universe” and “The Super Mario Bros. Movie.”“It’s great that we’re back in theaters and we’ve really made this for the big screen,” Sohn said. “Disney’s also letting this live longer in the theaters. It won’t go on Disney+ until fall or winter. And we made it in 3D as part of that moviegoing experience. There was a new level of immersion that made me focus on certain aspects of it. And because these characters aren’t human, it pushed the concept of their elemental-ness. When Ember turns her head in 3D, there are transparent levels that are moving around, that created a new level that was really interesting. I am biased, but we’re in a brave new world, I guess.”",

        "content": "With “I Shot Andy Warhol” in 1996, Mary Harron launched her filmmaking career by depicting an artist with a complicated legacy, and that fixation never left her. Her latest effort, “Dalíland,” follows that trajectory with a trenchant look at the later years of Salvador Dalí. While the legacies of many legendary creators have been reevaluated in modern times, Harron’s own fixations haven’t kept from appreciating her troubled subjects.“There are a lot of artists’ work that I do not want people to cut themselves off from,” the director told IndieWire in a recent interview. “I love reading Dostoyevsky, who was anti-Semitic and had crazy political ideas. I was very influenced as a young person by Polanski, who did terrible things and really should’ve been in prison for them. But that doesn’t mean his films didn’t continue to inspire.”As for Dalí: The Surrealist may have been a cruel egomaniac who expressed sympathies for Hitler at one point in his career, alienated scores of colleagues, and fueled his outlandish sexual fixations into his work. “He would say the most awful things, whatever came into his head,” Harron said. “So many of the artists and writers that I love, if you look at their personal lives, it’s very problematic. But I get so much from them. I’m most interested in where I can find something inspiring and finding the good I can take from somebody’s work.”In “Dalíland,” Ben Kingsley stars as the mustachioed provocateur at a late stage of his career as he wrestles with his legacy and looks back on his journey through the 20th century. The story, seen through the perspective of a young gallery assistant (Christopher Britney) drawn into Dalí’s bubble, also touches on the inherent conflict between Dalí’s artistic stature and the commercialization of his work. “Nobody got so deep into our primal, weird sexual instincts that pop up — the side of ourselves that everybody wants to suppress,” Harron said. “I don’t think you can untangle the commercial side from that.”Harron’s own journey through the creative market has been complicated. While her best-known credit is 2000’s “American Psycho,” the twisty portrait of a murderous investment banker (Christian Bale) received a mixed response when it came out. Harron said she didn’t realize that the movie had built a stronger following until almost a decade later as audiences caught onto the satiric edge of the drama. “That was a function of the internet, in terms of memes and a new audience discovering it,” Harron said. “Initially, people didn’t know it was funny. To me, it’s at least half comedy, and in the first screenings people were afraid to laugh.”She recently sat through the movie at a memorial screening for the late producer Ed Pressman and noticed the younger crowd cackling all the way through. “I realized they were seeing it differently,” she said. “They were seeing the way Christian’s performance is making fun of the character.”As for “Dalíland,” while the production was waylaid by pandemic-related delays, Kingsley remained committed to the part. “I was very appreciative of that,” Harron said. “From the very beginning, my biggest fights have been about casting.”On her last movie, 2018’s “Charlie Says,” she was adamant about casting Matt Smith as Charlie Manson despite his minimal fame at the time. “Of course, thanks to ‘House of the Dragon’ and stuff like that, now he’s super-famous,” Harron said. “Back then, he was just Doctor Who. You have to cast people who are right for the roles, and hopefully, that will help them become famous.”At 70, Harron remains on the margins of the studio system, though it hasn’t been for lack of trying. (“Dalíland,” which was produced independently and released by Magnolia Pictures, was turned down by Netflix and Amazon, among others.) “If I could get more money to do make a movie, I would be super happy about it,” Harron said. “There are very few people other than Scorsese or Paul Thomas Anderson who can do a studio movie and keep their control.”A former music journalist who pivoted to filmmaking in her late thirties, Harron has been picky about which projects she takes on, and resisted works for hire. “After ‘I Shot Andy Warhol,’ a lot of biopics about women came my way,” she said. “There was a script about the Brontë sisters that had them sitting around talking about sex as if they were at Starbucks. Yes, that’s exactly how the Brontë sisters hung around!”While the writers strike has delayed her process, Harron has recently been working on two new projects, including one with “American Psycho” screenwriter Guinevere Turner. While Harron said that she felt freer to pursue more projects now that her daughters, who are 23 and 24, have grown up, she wouldn’t rush into circumstances that prevented her from maintaining creative control. “It took me so long to direct my first film,” she said. “Years and years. I’m not going to do something I don’t really care about.”",

        "content": "Michael Cera was almost Mr. Aubrey Plaza.The “Life and Beth” actor revealed to Rolling Stone that he almost tied the knot with “Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World” co-star Aubrey Plaza during production on the 2010 Edgar Wright film.“We were driving through Vegas,” Cera said. “The idea was to then get a divorce right away, so we could call each other ‘my ex-husband’ and ‘my ex-wife’ at like 20.”Cera and Plaza ultimately did not wed, with Plaza marrying filmmaker Jeff Baena in 2021 and Cera calling Nadine Cera his spouse since 2017.However, the duo are reuniting for the upcoming “Scott Pilgrim” animated Netflix series, as announced earlier this year. The rest of the original ensemble cast, including Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Chris Evans, Anna Kendrick, Kieran Culkin, Satya Bhabha, Brie Larson, Alison Pill, Brandon Routh, Jason Schwartzman, Johnny Simmons, Mark Webber, Mae Whitman, and Ellen Wong, are also returning to voice their respective characters.“One of the proudest and most enjoyable achievements of my career was assembling and working with the dynamite cast of ‘Scott Pilgrim,'” writer-director Wright said in a statement. “Since the film’s release in 2010 we’ve done Q&A’s, remembrances and charity read throughs, but there was never the occasion to reunite the whole gang on an actual project. Until now. Original creator Bryan Lee O’Malley, along with writer BenDavid Grabinski have conjured up an anime series of ‘Scott Pilgrim’ that doesn’t just expand the universe, but also…well, just watch it. I’m more than happy to announce that I have helped coax the entire original cast back to voice their characters on this epic new adventure. You are in for a treat.”The series, which is still awaiting an official title, will feature original songs by Anamanaguchi and is animated by Science SARU studios. Abel Gongora will direct.Wright previously reflected on how the “Scott Pilgrim” graphic novel adaptation was originally viewed as a box office bomb after a dismal opening weekend, before gaining cult status later on. He compared the film to “Citizen Kane” and “Blade Runner” in terms of its lasting legacy.“I’ve said this to other filmmakers since who’ve maybe had a similar initial reaction to a film like ‘Scott Pilgrim’ did, is that the three-day weekend is not the end of the story for any movie,” Wright said in October 2022. “People shouldn’t buy into that idea. Rating films by their box office is like the football fan equivalent to films. Most of my favorite films that are considered classics today were not considered hits in their time.”",

        "title": "David Fincher Is Remastering ‘Seven,’ but He’s ‘Against the Idea of Changing’ What the Movie Is",
        "content": "David Fincher was in a characteristically misanthropic mood during a discursive Q&A with Steven Soderbergh Thursday night at Tribeca Festival. The directors have been pals since Soderbergh’s indie career launched more than three decades ago while Fincher became a Hollywood enfant terrible with “Alien 3.”“I hate reality, but it just keeps seeping in,” Fincher told his friend, who moderated the conversation at Manhattan’s Spring Studios, while noting that he is a “regret-generating entity” who loves rehearsal but, he said, “I don’t enjoy shooting.” Later, when asked by an audience member for advice on how to get an independent film out in the world, Fincher deferred to Soderbergh and said, “I’m a slave. I’m essentially going to beg for an inordinately huge amount of money,” noting that the “Sex, Lies, and Videotape” wunderkind might be better suited to answering the question.But one bit of news to come out of the conversation that should please ’90s Fincher fans is that the director — now set up at Netflix with “Love, Death, and Robots” and films “Mank” and the upcoming “The Killer” — is working on a 4K remaster of his 1995 serial killer noir “Seven.”That’s likely an uncomfortable experience for the director, who said he never looks back at his old work. (“I’m not brave.”) Fincher discussed the specific challenges of burnishing his moody urban nightmare starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as idealistic and hardened detectives, respectively, chasing a murderer who’s modeled his kills after the Seven Deadly Sins.“We’re doing ‘Seven’ right now, and we’re going back and doing it in 4K from the original negative, and we overscan it, oversample it, doing all of the due diligence, and there’s a lot of shit that needs to be fixed,” Fincher said. “Because there’s a lot of stuff that we now can add because of high-dynamic range. You know, streaming media is a very different thing than a 35-millimeter motion picture negative in terms of what it can actually retain. So there are, you know, a lot of blown-out windows that we have to kind of go back and ghost in a little bit of cityscape out there.”Perfectionist Fincher said that while issues may not be noticeable, “on a 100-inch screen, you’ll look at it and go, ‘What the fuck, they only had money for white cardboard out there?’ So that’s the kind of stuff on print stock. It just gets blown out of being there. And now you’re looking at it, going ‘I can see, you know, 500 units of what the fuck.’”Amid a time when Steven Spielberg is now regretting taking the guns out of “E.T.” for the 20th anniversary re-release of the film, and a racial epithet has been censored out of “The French Connection” on streaming services, Fincher said he is “fundamentally against the idea of changing what [‘Seven’] is.”“You can fix, you know, three percent, five percent. If something’s egregious, it needs to be addressed. But, you know, I’m not gonna take all the guns out of people’s hands and replace them with flashlights,” he said.“David’s got a laser pointer and it’s frozen on the shot and you’re like, ‘I want that part of the wall a quarter of a stock darker,’” Soderbergh said. “I walked out and laid down on a couch in the lobby because of what torture it is to see that.”Fincher’s “The Killer,” starring Michael Fassbender as an assassin gone rogue, is expected to release from Netflix in the fall.",

        "title": "‘You Can’t Make a Movie That Doesn’t Reflect Your Instincts’: Director Andy Muschietti on ‘The Flash’",
        "content": "When director Andy Muschietti came on board DC’s “The Flash,” he knew the tonal balance he wanted to strike. “We wanted to make a stylized movie that was at the same time realistic,” he told IndieWire’s Filmmaker Toolkit podcast. Although “The Flash” incorporates aspects of earlier DC releases (most notably Tim Burton‘s 1989 “Batman” and various movies from the Zack Snyder-verse), Muschietti’s approach is both funnier and less fanciful, with the comedy rooted in behavior and the design elements extrapolated more from reality than Burton and Snyder’s more deliberately artificial films.Part of how Muschietti achieved the balance had to do with his and cinematographer Henry Braham’s approach to coverage. Rather than force the actors into pre-planned blocking, Muschietti and Braham devised a system by which the camera would be handheld yet stabilized, giving the actors the freedom to move where they wanted. “[This approach] gives you a lot of freedom and it gives you the ability to make 360-degree shots,” Muschietti said. “It’s not studio mode where everything is cinematic in the classic way. The camera seems to be liberated, and that brings you closer to the feeling that what you’re seeing is more real.”The system Muschietti and Braham developed had the added benefit of allowing the filmmakers to move quickly. “I never shot faster in my life than with this rig,” Muschietti said, adding that the wide-angle lenses Braham used increased the sense of intimacy. “I love wide lenses because they create a lot of depth and the perspective is closer to the characters. This movie is all about emotions, and I want the camera so close to the actors that it’s like I can see their soul, you know?”The fluid, naturalistic style Muschietti achieved is all the more remarkable given that many scenes feature two iterations of The Flash’s alter ego Barry Allen, meaning that there are two Ezra Millers acting opposite each other. The freedom Muschietti was determined to give his actors meant the old way of shooting an actor’s dual performance, a la “Dead Ringers” (which starred Jeremy Irons, one of the actors in “The Flash”) or “Multiplicity” (a vehicle for another “Flash” star, Michael Keaton), was out. “In the age of ‘Dead Ringers,’ they used split screen, or if the camera was moving, they’d put in a double who looked like Jeremy Irons and shoot him three-quarters so you couldn’t see his face,” Muschietti said. “If I used split screen, it would feel stiff because you basically can only get static shots.”Muschietti dismissed another way of shooting “twin” effects, motion control, for more pragmatic reasons. “Motion control gives you a little bit of movement, but you still have to send the actor back to the makeup trailer and wait an hour for them to be turned into the other character,” Muschietti said.Muschietti worked with the visual effects department to devise a novel solution: Miller would shoot each scene opposite a double who had cameras attached to the top of their head that captured a 360-degree environment. Then, after the movie was shot and edited, Miller came back and reshot their scenes from the double’s position in a volume, where the virtual environment photographed by the double was projected around them so that they could react not only to themself but to all the other actors and action.During production, Miller played whichever Barry had the most lines in the scenes, then returned to play the other Barry during post. “It was a bit complicated, but it made sense,” Muschietti said. “It was a bit of a leap of faith and there was a lot of development to refine the process. The studio had its hesitations at the beginning because it was something that had never been done before, but they finally trusted us and our enthusiasm and went for it.”That enthusiasm never waned, even as Miller became embroiled in controversy and legal action. “I believed in this movie so much from the beginning that I knew that when people saw it, they were gonna love it,” Muschietti said. “Some of the people, I don’t know. But it wasn’t something that I was too concerned about, honestly.”In spite of the massive pressure of making a film at a larger scale than any of his previous movies, Muschietti never felt overwhelmed by the size. “The spectacle is something the audience appreciates when the movie is finished, but the truth is that when you’re in production working with the actors and rehearsing, the spectacle doesn’t really interfere with the emotional parts,” he said, adding that the studio’s support kept him from worrying that his point of view would be compromised. “I think they believe that the purest form of filmmaking results from chasing one vision instead of making a movie by committee. That’s what filmmakers do, they have a vision, and the vision comes from inside. When the vision comes from the outside, it’s a disaster.”Surprisingly, Muschietti said he felt far more pressure making his first short film than he any of his studio projects, including “The Flash.” “[Making films] is a process of learning to trust your instincts and finding things that excite you. When you finesse those instincts, then everything else is secondary. You can’t make a movie that doesn’t reflect your instincts. Of course, it’s not only about my instincts: It’s the screenwriter, Christina Hodson, and the cast is incredible. Ezra had so much to do with the success of the movie. I don’t know about the box office success because the movie hasn’t come out yet, but I think it’s a cinematic success because of all our combined instincts.”",

        "title": "Adrien Brody Didn’t Base His ‘Asteroid City’ Director Character on Wes Anderson, but He Sure Loves His Process",
        "content": "The Wes Anderson aesthetic, tone, and style are unmistakable. When this particular writer commented that you can recognize an Anderson film “within 10 seconds,” the subject of this interview interjected, “even less!” — and he’s not wrong. But there’s also the inherent charm of his often recurring cast of stars. Now appearing in his fifth Anderson feature, no one is a bigger fan of Anderson’s work and process than Oscar winner Adrien Brody.So once you hear that Brody, who talks with obvious joy and understanding about everything from Anderson’s ability to cast incredible young talent and the way he uses animatics to plot his films, is playing a director in “Asteroid City” — a theatrical director, but a director nonetheless — the question seems obvious: is he playing Anderson?No. Not really. OK, maybe a little, but certainly not more than his primary inspiration: Elia Kazan.“I’ve spent a lifetime with filmmakers,” Brody told IndieWire. “I’ve lost count how many movies I’ve made, but I’ve been working professionally since I was 12, and I’ve probably spent more time on a film set than many of the people I’ve worked with. I’ve learned a lot through the years, and everyone is so unique and obviously that informs some of my work in portraying this man.” (To wit: he’s Schubert Green, the director of the play version of what’s being made into a movie, which is what “Asteroid City” is about and what we promise makes much more sense on the screen in yet another Anderson gem.)Brody started acting when he was just a kid, notching both an Off-Broadway appearance and a PBS television film before he was 13. By age 16, he had his first film credit (the anthology feature “New York Stories,” appearing in Francis Ford Coppola’s short “Life Without Zoë”). He’s still the youngest person to win the Oscar for Best Actor (for Roman Polanski’s “The Pianist”). Over the course of his decades in Hollywood, he’s been directed by Spike Lee, Terrence Malick, Rian Johnson, Peter Jackson, and M. Night Shyamalan.“I referenced Kazan in a lot of ways, and Marlon Brando as well, but mostly Kazan just at that era,” Brody said. “It’s funny because, in ‘Blonde,’ I got to play Arthur Miller, and to some extent, these guys were pals. But Kazan really changed a lot of our expectation of what filmmaking and performance is, the expectations of that performance. And actors like Brando obviously kind of set the bar for actors of future generations to honor a more realistic emotive form of expression than what was the norm of the time. So I like those aspects of the film and Wes honoring that, and it’s also playful within that.”OK, so maybe there’s a bit of Anderson in there, if only because he’s so present in all of his work. “Even as an actor, when I am fortunate to play the protagonist in a film, [there’s] usually an element of the filmmaker [in there], if the filmmaker’s a writer on that,” Brody said. “There are a lot of qualities that, if you look, are present in that individual or relatable to that individual, so it’s there for the taking if you’re present.”When Anderson cast Brody in 2007’s “The Darjeeling Limited,” the actor, best known for heavy features like “The Pianist,” “The Thin Red Line,” and “Summer of Sam” was hardly an obvious pick for the lighter touch of an Anderson film. But it worked, and the pair have remained close, with Brody going on to also star in Anderson’s “Fantastic Mr. Fox,” “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” and “The French Dispatch.”“I’m incredibly honored and feel really privileged to have had such a long friendship and professional relationship with Wes,” Brody said. “He’s single-handedly influenced my life in many positive ways, from our time traversing India together and all these interesting towns throughout the world, Görlitz in Germany and Chinchón here in Spain. They’re kind of magical experiences where he pulls together so many interesting people, several of which have remained close friends. … I love the guy and we’re friends. He and my mother are friends! My mom’s been on every set, and it’s a family. It’s very unusual.”Asked if Anderson has ever told Brody why the filmmaker thought of him for more comedic features after the Oscar winner had spent so much time in darker projects, Brody paused. “He hasn’t told me that,” the actor said. “I think he’s seen within me the capacity for that work. … In my case, at that point in my career, I’d done some comedic work, but the films that I was known for were very dramatic roles. It’s my responsibility to represent those films and the subject matter, and there’s not really room for that levity. But the whole beauty of being an actor is to be diverse in the characters that you portray and the style in which you portray characters. And Wes has been very helpful in expanding that for me. And I’ve done a number of much more overtly comedic work since then.”So, what’s it like when Anderson lets Brody know he’s got something for him? Well, first there needs to be a script. “Wes will envision people perhaps as he’s writing, but he comes to you when he has something to share,” Brody said. And when he does? “There’s a musicality in the writing and a pace and an intrinsically sharp, ironic text. I feel like filmmakers try to duplicate that, and Wes does it so well because it comes from a real place. He feels it and sees it and finds humor in all that peculiarity.”He also loves the team around Anderson, including key grip Sanjay Sami (who has been with the pair since “The Darjeeling Limited” and is, as Brody tells it, “essential”) to frequent Anderson cinematographer Robert Yeoman. “For the timing to work for certain shots, so much is dependent on this one individual’s expertise and understanding of Wes’ specificity,” he added.For Brody, that specificity allows him to tap into both comedy and drama, a marriage of tones that he revels in. “There’s comedy and tragedy in real life,” Brody said. “And there’s a need to not play comedy overtly in comedy, unless you’re doing something that’s very superficially funny and which is also fun to do, but the key is to be well in on that joke and play it very straight and oblivious to the joke. That’s what kills, right?”“Tone is so important and being on the same page tonally with the people you’re working with, and sometimes you’re not all on the same page,” he said. “Sometimes the producer has a very different idea of what he would like of your portrayal than the director, and sometimes the other actor is doing something that is not necessarily in the same space that you feel you should be, so it’s a matter of aligning everyone’s vision to someplace that gels and then being present enough in that moment to hear it and modulate your reactions within the context of that.”Aligning shared visions? That’s not a problem on an Anderson set, Brody said, pointing to the filmmaker’s use of animatics (essentially, moving storyboards) as a visual reference and a tool for everyone to get a sense of the overall vision of the film.“It’s a wonderful tool for the actors to know the kind of tone of the film,” he said. “Wes will actually recite all the characters, interpret all those things, not that he’s asking you to do that exactly, but it’s a very meaningful guideline to help you get a sense of pace. And Wes’ pace is quite hitched up and demanding, so there’s no room for a thought or a pause that isn’t intentional. You have to be able to do all the physicality and deliver every line with some subtlety, but never skipping a beat and keeping it well within the time constraints that he sees it to be. And it’s very exciting. It’s very exciting.”Focus Features releases “Asteroid City” in select theaters on Friday, June 16, with expansion to follow on Friday, June 23.",

        "content": "Melissa McCarthy is calling out the misconception behind comedies in Hollywood during the latest episode of “Hot Ones.”“Somehow the new logline is that comedies don’t work,” McCarthy said. “I think bad comedies, I think bad movies don’t work but I will fight to my last breath, which will be in about 4 more wings, that comedies are important and I think it brings people together.”She added, “I just want to keep variety in the pie, I think once it goes darker, darker, darker, darker, darker…and it’s only dark that gets valued and it’s only the worst of humanity. It’s like I want to cry, I want to be heartbroken, I want to feel hopeful and I want to laugh.”McCarthy recently told The Guardian that it’s a “fist fight” to greenlit comedies.“I don’t know why, because we’ve never needed to laugh more,” McCarthy said. “Comedy allows you to sit next to somebody whose ideas don’t match up. And maybe you come out a little closer. I think that’s what I’m supposed to be doing, in this world.”The “Ghostbusters” actress added, “I can’t do a lot of useful things. I don’t know how to clean up the oceans, or stop our violent tendencies. But I can hopefully give someone who’s had a bad day an hour and a half to go into a different world where bills or illness isn’t the top thing on their brain. That’s the only skill set I really have. So I have to keep trying.”McCarthy is set to star in Kellogg’s biopic “Unfrosted” about the race between the food industry titan and Post to change breakfast cereal forever. Jerry Seinfeld directs, with “Borat 2” breakout Maria Bakalova, James Marsden, Hugh Grant, Amy Schumer, Jim Gaffigan, Drew Tarver, Max Greenfield, and Christian Slater also starring.McCarthy also recently shared her hopes for a “Bridesmaids” follow-up with the original cast, including Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, and Rose Byrne. “I would do a ‘Bridesmaids’ sequel this afternoon, right now,” McCarthy said. “That group of women was the most magical thing ever. Almost all of us were really good friends already. I think it was such a magical time.”",

We have a lot of trust between us. So I spent the most time with Cillian.”Blunt also noted that neighbor and co-star Matt Damon was a familiar face on set.“Matt Damon and I go back years back,” the “Devil Wears Prada” alum revealed. “Matt lives in our building, actually, so we would hang out a lot.”Blunt shared that her character Kitty is “kind of lethal” and a “non-conformist” for the era.“She’s such a big personality,” Blunt said. “She did not conform to the ‘50s housewife ideal. We love a non-conformist. And she was such a confidant for him and fiery and smart and troubled. Not an easy person. So I guess I saw her because she was a challenging person; it was a great challenge for me to take her on as a character.”Blunt teased of the R-rated historical epic, “You’re going to love it.

        "title": "Stellan Skarsgård Praises ‘Enormous Sets’ on ‘Dune: Part Two’: ‘You Feel It in Your Body’",
        "content": "Stellan Skarsgård is praising the “enormous sets” behind “Dune: Part Two” as another reason why practical effects trump green screens.The actor compared the upcoming Denis Villeneuve-helmed sequel to the “Star Wars” Disney+ series “Andor” during an interview with Entertainment Weekly. The “Andor” production built an entire outdoor city for the series, similar to the large-scope practical effects behind “Dune.”“I was very happy to be in that kind of ‘Star Wars’ universe and not like in many films, where you’re just in the world of green screens,” Skarsgård said. “Because it affects you physically when you have the set. You can’t deny that. It was the same thing with the sets on ‘Dune.’ They are physically there, these enormous sets, and you feel it in your body. You move differently.”He added, “We had all of Ferrix built up as this city. It’s very exciting.”“Dune: Part Two” is set to open in theaters November 3. Lead star Chalamet admitted he was “blindsided” by the production scale of the first “Dune” film. Director Villeneuve also teased that the entirely IMAX-shot sequel is the “main course” of the epic sci-fi saga, compared to the “appetizer” of the debut movie.“‘Part Two’ is more action-packed, epic war movie, much more bulk, much more dance,” Villeneuve said during 2023 CinemaCon. He added that while this is a resurrection of Arrakis, the film features entirely new sets and designs.Skarsgård plays the villain Baron Vladimir Harkonnen in the “Dune” films, spending much of his time on set in the makeup chair to suit up for the character’s sinister, ink-black look. Joining him in the cast this time are Christopher Walken, Florence Pugh, and Austin Butler, along with the regular cast of “Dune: Part One.”“Dune: Part One’s” sets earned the film the Academy Award for Best Production Design.For all the details on “Dune: Part Two,” click here.",

        "title": "‘Passages’ Trailer: Ira Sachs’ Sundance Breakout Captures Complicated Love",
        "content": "What happens when the line between art and love is blurred?Ira Sachs‘ Sundance standout film “Passages” poses the age-old question about commitment and the cruelty of love triangles for the sake of art.The official synopsis reads: After completing his latest project, filmmaker Tomas (Franz Rogowski) impulsively begins a heated love affair with a young schoolteacher, Agathe (Adèle Exarchopoulos). For Tomas, the novelty of being with a woman is an exciting experience that he is eager to explore despite his marriage to Martin (Ben Whishaw). But when Martin begins his own affair, the mercurial Tomas refocuses his attentions on his husband. Set in contemporary Paris, “Passages” charts an escalating battle of desire between three people, where want is a constant and happiness is just out of reach.Saïd Ben Saïd and Michel Merkt serves as producers on the film, which is distributed by Mubi.“Passages” marks Sachs’ eighth film. The cast spoke with IndieWire at 2023 Sundance with Rogowski explaining that it took a while to connect to his “irrational and mean” character.“The way [Sachs] composed those relationships was very interesting from the start, but it’s true that I had some concerns regarding the credibility, because [my character Tomas’] decisions seem to be sometimes so irrational or mean that it was hard for me in the beginning to find access to his world and the reasons that drive his decisions,” Rogowski said. “Being a human being that loves and desires and is full of fear and hope and spontaneous decision, it felt rather easy. It’s not just about this character being hard to understand. It’s also very funny how it’s combined sometimes, it’s also very ridiculous. Love, sometimes, is ridiculous and painful, but also, it always comes back to very human and intimate moments that allow you to accept the more challenging ones.”IndieWire critic David Ehrlich praised “Passages” for not shying away from the self-destructive habits of its intimate characters. “‘Passages’ is at its best whenever the modesty of its story is allowed to become a strength unto itself,” Ehrlich penned. “Sachs has always been a lightning rod for actors who aren’t afraid of making difficult choices — even if their characters are.”“Passages” premieres in theaters August 4.

        "title": "Lily Gladstone Makes Her Mark This Year with ‘Killers’ and ‘The Unknown Country’ — Watch the Trailer",
        "content": "Lily Gladstone is poised to be the talk of this year’s awards season thanks to her performance in Martin Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon.” But the “Certain Women” breakout actor also stars in the lonely American road movie “The Unknown Country,” written and directed by Morrisa Maltz with a story credit for Gladstone. Music Box Films releases the acclaimed feature on July 28 in New York City at the Quad Cinema and at the Nuart Theatre in Los Angeles. Watch the trailer below.Reeling from a devastating loss, Tana (Lily Gladstone) is pulled back into the world by an unexpected invitation to her cousin’s wedding. She packs up her late grandmother’s Cadillac and hits the open road, driving from her home in Minnesota to South Dakota. After reconnecting with her Oglala Lakota family, Tana sets off to retrace a surreal journey that her grandmother took decades ago, searching for the spot captured in an old family photograph. As she travels, Tana finds connection in the stories of everyday people who’ve settled down far off the main roads including Isaac (Raymond Lee), who provides a pivotal clue to understanding the lost location that could cultivate closure.From IndieWire’s review of the film: “With a face that beams a comforting inner light, Gladstone is a treasure. She exudes the kind of compassionate curiosity for others reserved for those who always listen attentively and empathize with your pain even if she can’t offer any advice. Not surprisingly, director Kelly Reichardt has collaborated with her in stories that revisit the Western mythos with a unique gentleness. In ‘The Unknown Country,’ Gladstone takes on a lead role with equal measures of vulnerability and playfulness, adding up to an endlessly captivating and tenderly potent performance.”Gladstone is already generating awards buzz for her performance in Scorsese’s “Killers” as Osage woman Mollie Burkhart, who is married to Leonardo DiCaprio’s character and suffers greatly while trying to stand on her tribal ground. She was last in the awards conversation for Reichardt’s “Certain Women,” which earned her a Film Independent Spirit Award nomination in 2017 for Best Supporting Female.Here’s the trailer for “The Unknown Country.”",

        "title": "‘Transition’ Review: Gender and Politics Collide in Brave Documentary",
        "content": "It’s no secret that war reporters are often adrenaline junkies with an astronomically high risk tolerance, but Jordan Bryon takes the cake. A documentarian based in Afghanistan, Bryon was embedded with a Taliban unit after the fall of Kabul while working on a film for the New York Times. A chilling prospect for anyone, much less a white Australian “infidel,” as one source calls him.But there’s one other little detail that puts Bryon at particular risk: He’s trans. During the risky assignment the 39-year-old journalist also filmed himself, capturing his unique situation in “Transition,” an astonishing documentary that merges the geopolitical with the personal.As Bryon takes steps to medically transition while living in the Middle East, his relationship to gender evolves against the backdrop of a strictly gendered society. The pressure to pass becomes a life or death situation (as it is for many trans people), a struggle made starkly visible by the extreme circumstances. Amazingly, the film never sags under the weight of its dire surroundings. That seems almost entirely thanks to Bryon’s good-natured humor (he is Australian, after all) and lucid self-reflection. Unsentimental and sharply restrained, “Transition” throws focus on its unbelievable central premise, letting the remarkable story speak for itself.The film was shot by Bryon and produced by Monica Villamizar. Both share director credit, a collaboration that seems to have maintained some neutrality while preserving the personal edge. Scenes of Bryon navigating various Taliban checkpoints and firefights are interspersed with more intimate settings, like when he gets his first testosterone injection from an underground doctor while lying prone on a conference table. He speaks not exactly to the camera but often to an invisible audience, narrating his shifting state of mind from his apartment in Kabul.He explains his basic experience of gender dysphoria, without belaboring the point. He always felt deeply uncomfortable in his body, which he soldiered through for 39 years before finally deciding to medically transition. His high-stakes career in the Middle East seems to have distracted from his personal distress, it also provided a surprising cover of relief.“Those things don’t follow me here. Afghanistan took me in,” he says. With his short hair and men’s apparel, Afghanis take him at face value, accepting him as a man.Conversations with his partner Kiana Hayeri, an Iranian photojournalist, reveal Bryon is being a bit cavalier about the risks. She is deeply concerned about the Taliban placement, reminding him of the danger in anyone finding out he’s trans. “I am absolutely playing with fire going to these villages,” he admits. “It’s possible that they would kill me.”The scenes in the village are the film’s most intense, and the respite of life in Kabul between visits comes as a relief. Accompanied by his partner and translator Teddy, the duo engage in surprisingly frank and engaging conversations. The most fascinating revelations come from one young soldier, or Talib, named Mirwais. Mirwais has a peculiar fascination with Byron, even at one point calling him “kind of beautiful.”At certain moments, it almost seems Mirwais knows something is different about Bryon, even if he can’t quite place it. Though he sees him as an infidel, Mirwais surprises himself by how much he likes the jocular Aussie. Bryon is “open-minded” and “non-judgmental,” qualities that could just as easily be used to describe Mirwais. When one Talib teased Bryon for his paltry beard, he recalls Mirwais saying: “There’s more to being a man than having a beard. Manhood comes from within.”Later, Bryon will travel to Tehran to get top surgery, and then home to Australia to see his mother, who is jovial and supportive. He is happy to receive a phone call from Mirwais, and teaches his mother to say “Salaam.” After they hang up, he explains that it was huge for Mirwais to even speak to his mother, as it is forbidden in Sharia law to even hear a woman’s voice. A consummate professional with a deep respect for Muslim religious beliefs and cultural mores, he worries the film will “betray them so publicly.”“Transition” doesn’t dwell too deeply in its ambiguities. The film was executive produced by Matthew Heineman, the Oscar-nominated director of “Cartel Land.” Not only is access is paramount, but human stories are more nuanced than mainstream media can fathom. When Bryon’s sympathy for the Taliban fighters begins to borders on naive, Kiana is there to remind him that she can no longer walk down the street due to harassment. The deeply gendered society that provides liberating cover for Bryon still terrorizes women and girls. The film makes plain the experience of being caught between a rock and a hard place, a boldly incisive metaphor for the trans experience.“Transition” premiered at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "title": "Wes Anderson on ‘Asteroid City’: Mental Health, Marilyn Monroe, and Sending Emails to Tom Hanks",
        "content": "Wes Anderson has explored many distinctive milieus over the years, from the fictional Zubrowska of “The Grand Budapest Hotel” to the bottom of the sea in “The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou” and “Isle of Dogs.” However, “Asteroid City” may be Anderson’s most personal backdrop yet, as its chief subject is storytelling itself.A playful meta narrative that defies simple categorization, “Asteroid City” functions as three movies in one: It’s the colorful story of a Junior Stargazers convention in a midwestern desert town circa 1955, but it’s also a 1950s TV play called “Asteroid City,” and on top of that, a behind-the-scenes look at a troubled playwright (Edward Norton) working on the aforementioned play. There’s an alien played by Jeff Goldblum, but also Jeff Goldblum playing an alien. Got all that?In addition to being a movie about acting, “Asteroid City” is an acting showcase. Anderson regular Jason Schwartzman plays a grieving parent, while Anderson newbie Tom Hanks plays the grieving father-in-law; Scarlett Johansson plays a glamorous movie star; Bryan Cranston narrates the TV show; other familiar faces include Adrien Brody, Jeffrey Wright, and Steve Carell (who, as Anderson told IndieWire this week, stepped in last minute to replace Bill Murray).With its shifting narrative trajectory, “Asteroid City” coheres into a fascinating meditation on the history of American storytelling, with references that stretch from the “Playhouse 90” era and the Actors’ Studio to “Close Encounters of the Third Kind.” It’s a unique creative stew for a filmmaker best known for developing his own homegrown style. While his quirky and immaculate aesthetic has been imitated with A.I. trailers galore (which he claims he doesn’t watch), the filmmaker remains an unpredictable storyteller well into the fourth decade of his career. At Cannes, the movie baffled some critics, but IndieWire’s David Ehrlich called it one of Anderson’s best — and it could make its way into the awards conversation later this year.All of that remains to be seen, but for now, Anderson is in good spirits. The director traveled from his main hub in Europe to New York on Sunday and quickly made his way to his usual hangout, Bar Pitti, to see friends. Then he hopped on the phone with IndieWire ahead of the U.S. premiere to unpack the many themes and inspirations behind his new work. He also explained the journey of his upcoming Netflix short film, “The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,” and shared his thoughts on the evolving careers of his favorite directors.The following interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.IndieWire: You often set your movies in the past, but this is the first time you’ve explored 1950s America and it’s clear you have a strong fascination with the film and theater work from that time. Since you were born in 1969, you weren’t alive for that era, so how did you develop such a strong relationship to it?Wes Anderson: When Owen Wilson and I were 18 or so, we were together everyday, we wanted to do the same thing and we knew we wanted to do it together. We had our college courses we were taking, but our real education was the one we were giving ourselves, which had a lot to do with movies. The thing at the center of it for us — if you kind of break it down — is Elia Kazan. We were so interested in Marlon Brando, James Dean, Montgomery Clift, and the world of these new voices in the movies of the ‘50s. It was so resonant. When I think about it now, how odd it is that while we loved the movies of the ’70s — we had all our guys from that period — the ’50s was really at the center of it for us. As much as it was about Kazan, it was also about the repercussions of Marlon Brando walking onto the stage.How do you see the interplay of Brando and other actors bringing their talent from theater to film?I have always been very susceptible to the mystique of a backstage story and the theater, just the aura of it. The ’50s New York stage is its own special thing, but there was this new kind of acting, this new variety of storytelling that Kazan and these playwrights of the period were a part of. In a way it was the most cinematic ever. Its effect is bigger on the movies than even on the stage. That’s where some part of this movie starts to come from for us and why it came to exist.Of course, that doesn’t address the way you position the American West here. It has an almost exotic quality.It has to do with a kind of Euro take on the American west. I thought a lot about Wim Wenders. I’ve always loved his interpretation of the landscape and the people in it. American stuff fascinates him from a sort of Berlin point of view. It comes back in a way that makes it fresh for me. He took a lot of still photographs out in California, Nevada, Arizona, places like that. In our earlier days, Owen and I loved Sam Shepard. He’s from California but his take on the West is filtered through an avant garde perspective. He goes to New York before he starts to tell these stories. His New York is Patti Smith and Lou Reed. It’s a downtown rocker New York. I think that’s also a kind of Euro thing. And then he ends up in collaboration with Wim Wenders on “Paris, Texas.”“Paris, Texas” certainly makes sense as a visual reference point for “Asteroid City,” but it also has a larger, almost hyperbolic sense of scale.There’s a different kind of cinema that comes from the ‘50s besides the Kazan approach, which is big-picture Cinemascope. Suddenly there are these widescreen things that take up the whole landscape, these wide formats they invented to make movies bigger. I’m drawn to that, too.You mentioned Marlon Brando earlier, but Marilyn Monroe is also relevant to “Asteroid City” as Scarlett Johansson’s character is clearly modeled on her. What is your relationship to her work?I can’t say that Marilyn Monroe has been a special fixation for me, especially knowing the struggle it sometimes was to get through the experience of making a movie with her. I love her in “Some Like It Hot” and “The Prince and the Showgirl.” Billy Wilder made two movies with her and he knew there was just no other way to get Marilyn Monroe than to go through the whole thing, to have Paula Strasberg telling her what to do behind his back. She’s this most vulnerable kind of talent where there’s something real happening in front of the camera. She’s a movie actress who goes back the other way. I don’t know that she ever played on the New York stage, but she went into the Actors Studio and tried to dig deep in that way.Did you see “Blonde”?No, but I know Adrian plays Arthur Miller in it. Is it good?It’s troubling, because it seems to have a hard time appreciating the good in her work because of what she endured.You know, in the end, there’s always this kind of thing around mental health. No matter how much talent somebody has, in the end, they’re still subject to however the brain works and god knows, brain trauma can come in so many forms. It’s one thing to play a scene. In a way, being an actor is pretty straightforward. But it’s an unbelievably difficult thing to find your way to being magical, to aspire to something, and find your way to it. There’s just no recipe. It’s a mixture of things you have to discover.Actors don’t always want to go along with a specific vision. “Asteroid City” seems to take that into account. Does it frustrate you when your cast doesn’t quite get what you’re going for?There’s nothing I love more, even when it makes the process more challenging and tumultuous, than having somebody who just wants to throw themselves completely into the thing and believes in it. The whole thing with this movie is about having spent some time with actors and experiencing what an emotional ride they go on and what it means to me to be with them.It also seems to be a meditation on stardom, so it’s notable that you’re working with Tom Hanks for the first time. What was it like to get him onboard?By the time I had the chance to work with Tom Hanks on this movie, he had crossed a sort of threshold into being more iconic. He’s a full-on icon now. If I’d worked with him in 1998 or something, he would’ve been a big movie star, but not a legend. He expanded over those years. I’d met him very briefly a couple of times over the years and I had his email address. When I was working on this movie, I thought he’d be perfect for this because he’s interested in the 20th century history of America. We’ve seen him pursue this era in his work. It was pretty simple: I wrote him, said I had this, and asked him to read it. He wrote me back and said, “When are the dates?” He’s the kind of person where he’s going to make everything work better and more smoothly. He’s going to do things to help you make the movie. Then also Rita his wife came with him and she’s in the movie. Their enthusiasm helps make everything better. And on top of that, they have a son who works on our movies too now, and stayed on with us after “Asteroid City.”What’s real in this movie? You have actors playing people in a story but they’re also playing actors rehearsing that story…Those characters are the actors who they’re playing, but for me, I still feel like they’re the characters the actors play. They mix together for me. The black-and-white and the color parts, somehow I feel they’re one person. The alien is Jeff Goldblum in his costume but I feel like he’s also this uncontrollable thing beyond our understanding that’s entered into the mix.The most spectacular scene in the movie — and maybe all of your work — comes when the whole cast begins to chant “You can’t wake up if you don’t fall asleep.” Where did that line come from?The scene itself comes out of this acting class where they’re doing exercises. Sometimes what you’re doing in an acting class is quite abstract because you’re taking it out of character and instead you’re going into something to “test your instrument,” to train yourself to do something that a text will require of you, but you don’t know what that text is. They’re inventing a kind of acting exercise but they’re also meant to be trying to help this playwright break through a sort of block he’s got in his script. He has something he’s envisioning and he’s not sure what it is, so he’s looking to this company to workshop it with him. Then this thing kind of bursts out of them.But there’s a bigger idea embedded in that line.That was sort of the context of this scene, but what actually happens in it is still something that happens spontaneously between you and a pencil or a typewriter. You’re waiting for the thing that is also beyond your control to suddenly happen. I will say there’s a theatrical kind of reference to it but I’m hesitant to say it. At some later date, I’ll say it. It’s something that has been adapted. It’ll be more interesting at a later date. Actually when I do tell you, then you’ll see it, and it’ll be interesting. Better to let it simmer for now.Earlier you mentioned how ’70s American cinema inspired you. Many of the filmmakers you’ve cited as your favorites from that period are still working today. What do you make of their evolution as you consider your own evolving body of work?People are sort of obligated to compete with themselves and everything they do is compared to their earlier work. There’s a certain view that people do their best work as movie directors in their 30s or 40s and 50s, not really their 60s or 70s. They don’t say that about conductors. But with this group, there has been a lot of especially good work from them in their 70s. Martin Scorsese is over 80 and he’s got a big movie coming out. I haven’t seen “Killers of the Flower Moon,” and I wouldn’t say that “Wolf of Wall Street” has the kind of blast of originality and inspiration that gives us “Goodfellas,” but it used all these kind of tools and techniques that he sort of invented. He was working with actors in a way he hadn’t in years, in an improvisational way that he’s so great at it. He made this great, huge movie that’s endlessly entertaining.Now we see Paul Schrader with a whole set of later movies that are sort of Bressonian, where he’s taken a sort of focus and taken back something for himself. Spielberg’s collaborations with Tony Kushner have produced such interesting work and it’s all later period stuff. Even Frances Coppola who hasn’t made a movie in some time is now making something gigantic. He’s taking on a tremendously personal project he’s been wanting to do all these years. It’s a twist on the whole that’s been interesting and surprising. But I’d say each one has a different kind of virtuosity that’s totally unique to them.Brian De Palma has given you a lot of guidance over the years. How much has he inspired the way you approach filmmaking?You could always say that De Palma follows Hitchcock’s path, but a lot of people have followed De Palma’s path. His point of departure from Hitchcock’s influence is so strong. I have tried to do bits like a De Palma scene, setting up a sequence like De Palma would, but it’s almost impossible for me to do. Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson have done scenes where they set things up like De Palma and do it well. Not me. I had to find other things in his work. There are certain things he does that I certainly steal but others that I can’t steal, because I’m not capable of it.What relationship do you have to the WGA strike going on right now?I don’t have a writers room. It has a completely different context from the way I work. I’m not involved with that. I’ve never worked in a writers room. It’s been so long since I lived in Los Angeles. It’s a bit of a world apart from the area where I work.But it could get in the way of your ability to work.I’m not writing. If I was writing something, it wouldn’t be business as usual because I’d be on strike.You have a project you’re hoping to shoot this fall, right?But that’s already written. If I was in the middle of that script, I’d say I wish I could finish writing my script, but that’s not the case. You know, I hope everybody gets what they want and the deals are made to people’s satisfaction.You’re a real theatrical purist, but you have a new project coming up with Netflix, an adaptation of “The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar.” Are you concerned that it might not get the kind of big-screen life you prefer?In my case it’s a little bit of a weird thing. I knew Roald Dahl since before we made “Fantastic Mr. Fox.” I met Lindsay Dahl, his widow, when we were shooting “The Royal Tenenbaums” like 20 years ago. For years I wanted to do “Henry Sugar.” They set this story aside for me because I was friends with them. Lindsay kind of handed the torch to Luke, Dahl’s grandson. So I had this waiting for me. But I really couldn’t figure out the approach. I knew what I liked in the story was the writing of it, Dahl’s words. I couldn’t find the answer, and then suddenly I did. It’s not a feature film. It’s like 37 minutes or something. But by the time I was ready to do it, the Dahl family no longer had the rights at all. They had sold the whole deal to Netflix.Suddenly, in essence, there was nowhere else you could do it since they own it. But beyond it, because it’s a 37-minute movie, it was the perfect place to do it because it’s not really a movie. You know they used to do these BBC things called “Play for Today” directed by people like Steven Frears and John Schlesinger and Alan Clarke. They were one hour programs or even less. I kind of envisioned something like that.So this is more akin to the short film “Hotel Chevalier” you made for Apple in 2007.Yes. It’s not quite the choice between a full-fledged cinema release and a streaming release because you would never distribute a short film like that and distribute it in cinemas. They’d have to sell cheaper tickets or do a double feature. I will say is that while I had only a good experience with Netflix, but I’m very happy to be putting “Asteroid City” in cinemas. Focus and Universal are doing it the real cinema way. That’s the way I really want my movies to be shown.You moved to Europe over 15 years ago and divide your time between England and France. How does living outside the U.S. impact you as a filmmaker?What I love is that my experience of the world is broader than it was. I didn’t grow up in Los Angeles or New York. I grew up in Houston. It was a more narrow perspective. Aside from knowing now what it’s like to live somewhere else, the experience of being a foreigner teaches you all kind of things, some you can’t really describe. But also, as I’ve worked in various places all over the world, I’ve gathered collaborators as I’ve gone along. I have people I’ve met in all corners of the world, really, who have stayed with me. They all bring things from their places that we use as a group. I’ve really loved having a bigger experience than anything that my parents had.",

        "content": "Warner Bros. is hoping Christopher Nolan will return to the studio, according to the film group’s co-CEOs.Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy, who share the CEO title at Warner Bros. Film Group, addressed Nolan’s departure from the studio for Universal after the release of “Tenet,” his ninth film at Warners.“We’re hoping to get Nolan back,” De Luca told Variety in a cover story. “I think there’s a world.”Nolan collaborated with Warner Bros. for close to 20 years but exited for a deal with Universal which will release his upcoming epic “Oppenheimer.” Nolan publicly condemned Warner Bros. for releasing the studio’s 2021 film slate in a day-and-date hybrid model with streamer HBO Max, led by then-WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar, who is no longer with the conglomerate. “Tenet,” however, was not released day-and-date on streaming platforms when the time-bending action thriller came out in September 2020. But the film was repeatedly delayed theatrically due to the pandemic.Now, Nolan’s next feature “Oppenheimer” is competing with the highly anticipated Warner Bros. film “Barbie” on a shared July 21 release date. Nolan has reportedly requested a 100-day theatrical window for “Oppenheimer” ahead of release on PVOD platforms.Two sources told Variety that Nolan “received a seven-figure royalty check from Warner Bros. within the past eight months” tied to 2020 film “Tenet.” Per the sources, “no strings were attached” to the money transfer.Nolan allegedly has also done post-production work for “Oppenheimer” on the Warner Bros. lot, according to Variety.IndieWire has reached out to representatives for Warner Bros. and Nolan for comment.Warner Bros. film group co-CEO Abdy said that in the wake of the COVID-19 release shuffle, the company is “through the worst of it.”“After the AT&T years, everyone felt a bit of battered child syndrome,” co-CEO De Luca agreed. “We have one of the best film libraries in existence, so we started inviting our filmmakers to come and choose a movie that inspires them and talk about it with our staff.”“Oppenheimer,” which stars Cillian Murphy as the creator of the atomic bomb and one of the leaders of the Manhattan Project, currently has all IMAX theaters in North America booked for its first three weeks of release.",

        "title": "Inside 5 Mind-Blowing Dimensions in ‘Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse’",
        "content": "[Editor’s note: The following interview contains spoilers for “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.”] It’s a brave new multiverse for Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) and Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) in “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.” It was the same for Sony Pictures Imageworks, which introduced several new dimensions and characters inspired by a multitude of trippy-looking Marvel comic book designs. And for that, Imageworks created innovative tools for translating more elaborate 2D stylization into 3D with new systems for using pencil, pen and ink, markers, and paintbrushes.In “Across the Spider-Verse,” we travel to the watercolor-inspired Earth-65, from which Gwen’s Spider-Woman hails; Earth-50101, a mashup of Mumbai and Manhattan called Mumbattan, home to Spider-Man India (Karan Soni); Earth-928, the futuristic brutalism of Nueva York, where Spider-Man 2099 (Oscar Isaac) runs Spider-Society HQ; and Earth-42, the noirish world where the spider that bit Miles originated. Plus, we get a glimpse of Earth 138B’s New London through Hobie Brown/Spider-Punk (Daniel Kaluuya). He embodies the look of rock posters from the ’70s, with photocopied paper textures cut and pasted together and constantly moving at different frame rates.In addition, we’re introduced to two baddies: The Vulture, a bird villain (Jorma Taccone) from the Italian Renaissance who lands at the Guggenheim Museum in Earth-65, and Spot (Jason Schwartzman), the bizarre-looking nemesis of Miles, who’s all white with black spots that serve as inter-dimensional portals.“This movie was so heavily painterly and stylized,” returning VFX supervisor Michael Lasker told IndieWire. “And we had to control dry brushes, wet brushes, control it in depth, making brushes move and repaint. We didn’t have any of that before. So all of it had to be developed on this film, and it’s a testament to the creativity and ingenuity of the group [at ImageWorks].”The look of Gwen’s world was partly inspired by Robbi Rodriguez’s covers for Jason Latour’s comics, with their vertical striation and striping of paint. However, the idea of it being a wet-on-wet watercolor world was original. The idea was that it changes in every shot like a mood ring keyed to Gwen’s emotional state. This was achieved with a tool called Rebelle and new brush stroking systems.“A lot of the Gwen’s world frames looked almost like a flat painting,” Lasker said. And a lot of it comes down to the composition and the lenses. And if you’re shooting it very flat, it lends itself well to being more graphic.“The opening sequence was very tricky ’cause we had to have it timed out to music with her drumming. It was actually one of the last sequences that we finished. But we did a lot of 2D shapes. It was very graphic-inspired. And then we mixed that in with renders of Gwen and drumming to create this hybrid look. It’s not as washy, it’s not as wet; it’s just a little bit cleaner. And then we bring in a lot more of that wet look, more painterly at times, depending on her emotion.”The Vulture was worlds apart from Spot, which was treated as a painting built up from nothing with spots that were animated and ink smeared in effects. The first challenge was figuring out the Da Vinci-style parchment for this crazy vulture creature. And then they had to make him stand out in Gwen’s world amidst all the saturated blues, purples, and greens.The Vulture was fully rigged, inked with multiple layers of lines that were interpolated and then meshed with other materials and effects. “Not only did his rig, his modeling, and his linework have to be on paper, but there were markings that he drew in the air as he rebuilt his wing,” said Lasker. “We had a splotchy paper texture on him. And, in some shots, we worked in a little bit of that sort of nickelodeon-style flickering, almost like a flip book effect with a little bit of light flickering behind him. He was always a little bit different in every shot.”This world was distinctive to its India comic book style, where the ink wasn’t always perfectly on form, the printing was a little bit offset, and there were a lot of overlapping colors and forms outside the lines. They created an action-packed, 2D-looking tapestry, sometimes working in half-tones and making it look like it wasn’t printed properly. It took new tools for simulation, linework, and non-photorealistic compositing to pull it off.“They really wanted it to feel like the city was dense with wires, with people, with traffic,” Lasker added. “So we wanted almost a rougher look and it was like the juxtaposition of those two ideas, which was interesting. We used our line tool and we did a lot of early tests where we took a car and drew lines around it, but we made it really messy and we made the shadows messy. You wanted it to feel busy, to have enough of the graphic looks in every shot that you feel the style, but also read the characters’ emotion in their performance.”There is beauty and coldness in the Syd Mead and John Berkey-inspired brutalism of Neuva York in 2099, where a clean, futuristic world stands high above the Spider-Society HQ underworld, where it’s dark and neon-lit. This aesthetic required its very own brushstroking tool, which was first tested on Mumbattan.“We used that brushstroking tool, but we actually used real marker strokes and brought them into the tool,” Lasker said. “And the trick with markers was how you layered them, blended them together, but with their own feel. So markers had their own look. And it’s a very powerful tool where you can use lines for shadows, for edges. It can be messy, it can be sketchy, it can be tight to the form, but not messy like the India style.This is a nightmarish world for Miles stylistically based on Sean Gordon Murphy’s “Batman: White Knight” comic series: dark, gritty, hard-edged, and scary. “So we did a lot of experiments to convey light without using light,” Lasker said. “We would use line work to reveal light, and we did a lot of ink splatter techniques: very sharp, unforgiving lines, a little bit of dry brush, but there’s no gradient anywhere.”They also used very saturated red, black, and green in Miles’ apartment. “This very green, gritty, spindly stairwell, we built out from there,” added Lasker. “And how we treated lens flares and lights and our offsetting and our line work was really an interesting look.”",

        "title": "‘Extraction 2’ Review: Netflix’s Brutally Entertaining Action Sequel Belongs on the Big Screen",
        "content": "When we last left “Extraction” hero Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) he was, well, he was dead. He’d been beaten, shot multiple times, and tossed into a river, where he was presumably (again) dead. And yet…in the final moments of the Sam Hargrave-directed feature, a shadowy figure emerged, looking a bit like Tyler, albeit very much not dead, to watch over his young charge so many months after his apparent (and, sorry, last time here) death. But, in the world of blockbuster filmmaking, no one is ever really dead (or, at least, no one is ever allowed to be really dead, as long as test audiences have a say), least of all an ass-kicking Aussie mercenary with a secret soft side, and thus: “Extraction 2.”That Tyler is indeed not dead has served as the backbone of the Netflix action sequel’s marketing campaign, complete with the kicky hashtag #TylerRakeLives and its accompanying “punching arm on fire” emoji (which is basically this franchise in a nutshell). So it should come as little surprise that Hargrave’s sequel opens with the badass’ fraught resurrection. Flashbacks remind us of the many wounds the black market mercenary endured at the end of his last mission to extract an innocent kiddo. Tyler is soon pulled out of the river and essentially brought back to life — we’re told many times he was “clinically dead!” See! — thanks to great medical care and the sheer force of will of his handler Nik (Golshifteh Farahani) and her wise-cracking brother Yaz (Adam Bessa).But what does Tyler have to live for? In the first “Extraction,” Tyler’s biggest asset was his total disregard for his own safety — inspired by his profound guilt over abandoning his young son as he was dying of cancer, a traumatic throughline referenced in the first film, and exploded further outward in its sequel. But with his body almost irrevocably broken, that’s not a feasible way forward. Just as Tyler is healing up in Dubai, Joe Russo’s screenplay zings us over to Georgia, where we’re introduced to the intensely bonded criminal brothers Zurab (Tornike Gogrichiani) and the incarcerated Davit (Tornike Bziava).It’s clear that the duo will somehow intersect with Tyler and his team, and Russo offers a swift reveal of who actually needs to be extracted — this time, a family of three (Tinatin Dalakishvili as the mom, Andro Jafaridze as her son Sandro, and sisters Mariami and Marta Kovziashvili trading off as youngest sibling Nina) with a latent connection to Tyler. This ensures the ailing mercenary has no choice but to shape up and get back in the field. (It does not hurt that Idris Elba appears as the shadowy, nameless figure who offers Tyler the job, an absolutely obvious bid to further expand this franchise that’s also impossible to mind.)Cue up the “Rocky IV”-esque training montage — Austria subs in for the Soviet Union, though moments in which an angry Tyler chops wood and pushes heavy loads through snowy drifts smack of that classic boxing drama — and soon, Tyler is busting his way through a Georgian prison to save the terrified trio and battle back innumerable baddies in the process (Davit being just one of literally dozens). Hargrave’s 2020 feature directorial debut boasted an eye-popping 12-minute one-shot action sequence that saw Tyler fighting his way through Dhaka, Bangladesh, which Hemsworth, the director, and their talented stunt team have quite literally doubled up on, care of a 21-minute-long sequence styled to feel like a single shot.This one takes Tyler and company through (deep breath) the initial prison break, a bone-crunching one-on-one with the pissed-off Davit, a massive prison yard melee (see: flaming arm), a high-energy car chase (in which many baddies die in quite funny ways), a desperate run through a creaky factory, a nutso train-set sequence (complete with swirling helicopters full of bad guys and plenty of hand-to-hand combat), and an explosive conclusion. This is how the first act of Hargrave’s film closes, an instantly iconic sequence that sets the film a cut above both its predecessor and the rest of its Netflix actioner brethren. Mostly, it deserves — hell, it nearly demands — to be seen on the big screen, though precious few Netflix subscribers will get that chance.While original Netflix action films have proven to be big hits for the streamer — the first “Extraction,” plus “Red Notice,” “The Mother,” and “The Gray Man” currently rank among Netflix’s all-time top 10 films — few are given a theatrical berth when they are released. (A handful of titles do still get limited runs before they hit the service.) The care and precision that go into the most brutal and bombastic sequences of “Extraction 2,” from that insane one-r to a later skyscraper-set battle royale, offer some of the best examples yet of what Netflix-backed talent can churn out, the kind of stuff that still belongs in a movie theater with a rip-roaring crowd. And while few viewers are likely to tune out of “Extraction 2” during such moments, at least based on the popularity of the first film and the anticipation for this one, it’s a shame that only a limited pool will see it in the best conditions, where tuning out is (ideally) not even an option.The high energy of the film’s action sequences also helps paper over some of its less thrilling elements, including frequent exposition, a thinly drawn antagonist, and hammy flashbacks to Tyler’s previous pains that are mostly unnecessary. But when this thing moves — and, wow, does it ever — it offers one of the best examples yet of what Netflix bucks can buy. It even makes off with upped emotion (including that engendered by shining a brighter spotlight on the wonderful Farahani and Bessa), a new dimension to the always-evolving Hemsworth, and proof that the action franchise can capture old thrills with new stories. It won’t look as good on your TV or your computer, but that’s a mission for another day.“Extraction 2” starts streaming on Netflix on Friday, June 16.",

        "title": "Wes Anderson Movies, Ranked: ‘Bottle Rocket’ to ‘Asteroid City’",
        "content": "Let’s get this out of the way right from the top: Wes Anderson has never made a bad movie, and — in all likelihood — he probably never will. He’s too particular, too immaculate, too in command of his craft. Of course, the fact that he has always been so sure of himself only makes it more tempting to chart the progress of his career and to measure his films against each other. Or maybe it’s just fun because there are still only 11 of them, and everyone seems to have their own favorite. Who could say?Anderson is the rarest of rarities, an arthouse filmmaker who not only finds ways to consistently make ambitious original projects, but also maintains genuine influence on what remains of mainstream pop culture. (None of the other esteemed directors who competed for the Palme d’Or at this year’s Cannes Film Festival were the subjects of viral TikTok trends.) But the instantly-recognizable aesthetic that propelled Anderson to filmmaking superstardom often prompts his critics to look at his work through an oversimplified lens. Many of Anderson’s films contain similar stylistic flourishes — like twee interior design with perfect color palettes, inserts of hand-written notes, and the presence of Jason Schwartzman, to name a few. But the visual similarities mask the fact that he has covered an insanely wide range of narrative ground in his 25 years of filmmaking. From dry comedies and whimsical animated features to painfully mature dramas about the nuances of grief, Anderson’s filmography is anything but monolithic. We all know what a Wes Anderson movie looks like, but the differences between his films and the substance of his artistry are complex subjects that merit rigorous debate. With “Asteroid City” opening in select theaters this weekend (and his Roald Dahl adaptation “The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar” hitting Netflix later this year), it’s a perfect time to reevaluate Anderson’s catalogue. Here are all of Wes Anderson’s feature films, ranked from “worst” to best.[Editor’s note: This story was published on May 1, 2017 and has been updated multiple times since.]Almost as indebted to Satyajit Ray and Jean Renoir as “The Grand Budapest Hotel” is to the writings of Stefan Zweig, “The Darjeeling Limited” never pretends that it isn’t the work of a white guy from Texas who was raised on the “exoticism” of movies like “Charulata” and “The River.” On the contrary, Wes Anderson’s uneven fifth film confronts that naïveté head-on, telling a story about three grieving brothers who travel to India with the half-assed hope that they can bottle up some of the country’s spiritualism and take it home as a souvenir.Riding the eponymous train through the countryside and looking out the window like everything they see is a backdrop for their self-obsessive bullshit, Anderson’s most noxious cast of characters learns the hard way that you can’t be a tourist in your own family. Modernist to the extreme and a bit stilted as a result, “The Darjeeling Limited” doesn’t quite match the sum of its parts, but — from Bill Murray’s opening dash to Amara Karan’s unforgettable performance — the parts are pretty great. —DEWes Anderson arrived fully formed (or close to it), and so much of his cinematic ethos can be distilled from the very first shot of his very first film, the camera crashing in on Luke Wilson’s young face with the confidence of a master and the exuberance of an eternal kid. And it’s really that energy that makes “Bottle Rocket” such a perfect indication of what was to come.Yes, the film is full of Anderson’s future signatures — whip-pans, insert shots of handwritten lists, overly elaborate plans, the hierarchy of accessories that are assigned for infiltration missions (and used as measuring sticks for love) — but the director’s debut points the way forward because it’s so high on its own existence, its characters as committed to the bubbles they create for themselves as we are to watching them burst.Anderson’s most naturalistic film by a long shot (there’s something so intolerably casual about those gray skies), this puckish caper movie sputters out at least three different times before James Caan even shows up to spark the third act, but “Bottle Rocket” is colorful even when it isn’t sparkling. Would Wes Anderson have even been possible without Owen Wilson there to translate him for us? His Dignan, dreamy and deranged, set the mold for at least seven movies to come, playing the guy in an electrified defensive coil of some kind, always trying to disguise themselves and doing such a poor job of it that you can’t help but laugh at their transparency (“What are you putting that tape on your nose for?” Bob Mapplethorpe asks. “Exactly,” Dignan replies). Thank God someone was able to see through the film’s disastrous box office performance and recognize that this was the start of something great. —DE“Oh, shit! Swamp leeches. Everybody, check for swamp leeches, and pull them off… Nobody else got hit? I’m the only one? What’s the deal?”It’s amazing, just when he was on the verge of becoming a household name, Wes Anderson made a dry nautical epic about Jacques Cousteau being a shitty father. I mean, I’d appreciate this movie being made under any circumstances, but “The Life Aquatic” is the only Wes Anderson film that feels as though it exists for the simple reason that someone was willing to fund it.As exhaustingly dense as “The Royal Tenenbaums,” as spirited as “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” and as anarchic as “Fantastic Mr. Fox,” this expansive adventure is even better than the Adidas sneakers it inspired. Yeah, it sits uncomfortably in the middle of Anderson’s career and sometimes play like a watered down version of his previous work, but it also features Bill Murray as a vengeful shark hunter, Seu Jorge covering David Bowie, Cate Blanchett radiating right off the screen, Willem Dafoe as an over-sensitive German sailor, and Bud Cort giving us the closer that “Harold and Maude” never did. —DEIf the two decades that brought us “Rushmore,” “Fantastic Mr. Fox,” and “Moonrise Kingdom,” felt like a passionate love affair between cinephiles and Wes Anderson, the release of “The French Dispatch” is more akin to settling into a comfortable relationship. The excitement inevitably fades when you pretty much know what you’re going to get, but that does not negate the fact that Anderson is one of the most technically proficient filmmakers working today. As his aesthetic becomes more recognizable, if that’s even still possible, the (often unfair) question of what Wes Anderson is offering beyond unique interior design choices and snappy dialogue will weigh on him more with each subsequent film.“The French Dispatch” succeeds in part because it does not particularly try to answer that question, instead offering a light ensemble piece that goes down relatively easily and gives Anderson plenty of opportunities to work with new actors and show off the cinematic bells and whistles his devotees have come to expect. The thinly veiled tribute to The New Yorker does an excellent job of weaving multiple stories together without boring audiences, even if that means sacrificing the narrative heft of some of Anderson’s earlier films. While this was probably Anderson’s first opportunity to cast Timothée Chalamet since the young actor broke through in 2017, the pairing still felt long overdue. As did the film’s decision to partially shoot in black and white, which gave Anderson a new color palette that produced some stunning shots. Anderson’s technical precision has never been better — even if the film looks less flashy than some of his earlier work, there is no doubt that he is at the top of his game as a visual filmmaker. “The French Dispatch” did not represent a massive step forward in Anderson’s filmography, but it was not a step backward, either. —CZThe world is trash, and Wes Anderson is currently enjoying the hottest streak of his career. These things, it turns out, are not unrelated. The worse things get, the more fantastical Anderson’s films become; the more fantastical Anderson’s films become, the better their style articulates his underlying sincerity. Disorder fuels his imagination, and the staggeringly well-crafted “Isle of Dogs” is nothing if not Anderson’s most imaginative film to date.There’s a whiff of inevitability to that. Whether telling a story about a splintered New York dynasty or one about a faded European hotel where it used to be possible to find some faint glimmers of civilization in this barbaric slaughterhouse known as humanity, Anderson has always been attuned to the beauty of magical idylls, to the violence of losing them, and (most of all) to the fumblingly tragicomic process of building something better from the rubble. So at a time when global warming and gun violence have become inescapable — a time when fascism and xenophobia are no longer abstract threats so much as Republican campaign promises — it’s no wonder that America’s fussiest auteur is operating near the peak of his powers.“Isle of Dogs” is the work of an artist who’s howling into the same wind that’s currently blowing in all of our faces. Blending Akira Kurosawa and Hayao Miyazaki into a darkly comic fable about a boy, his dog, and a world that’s on the brink of running out of biscuits, this is a movie that literally asks: “Who are we, and who do we want to be?” And since it’s a Wes Anderson movie, those questions are posed straight into the camera. It’s funny, it’s grim, and it’s probably the most pet-able bit of dystopian fiction we’ve ever seen. —DEIf all of Anderson’s movies are sustained by the tension between order and chaos, uncertainty and doubt, “Asteroid City” is the first that takes that tension as its subject, often expressing it through the friction created by rubbing together its various levels of non-reality. Some might see that as self-amused navel-gazing, but the unexpected moment towards the end when Anderson finds a certain equilibrium between those contradictory forces — with a major assist from a movie star whose name you suddenly remember seeing in the credits some 100 minutes earlier — is so crushingly beautiful and well-earned that the artifice surrounding it simply falls away.Read IndieWire’s complete review of “Asteroid City” by David Ehrlich.For such a singular artist and aesthete, Wes Anderson has always been comfortable with wearing his influences on his sleeve, rightly confident that he can celebrate his touchstones without resigning to them. For proof, just look at the way his characters worship each other in order to find themselves — from Ned Plimpton’s childhood obsession with Steve Zissou, to the mild awe that Gustave H. inspires from his new lobby boy, Anderson understands that self-discovery is the last stage of a failed attempt to become someone else. Maybe that’s why “Rushmore” represented such a breakthrough for him, because this coming-of-age story about a super precocious kid (and the grown man who goads along their mutually assured destruction) is so giddy about the things that made it possible.Running on the fumes of the French New Wave and drafting behind American touchstones like Mike Nichols and Albert Brooks, Anderson’s second feature is like an artistic manifesto that never declines to cite its sources. And, not for nothing, it gave the world Jason Schwartzman, reinvigorated Bill Murray, and — most importantly — made it possible for generations of viewers to say “Wait wait, go back… was that Rory Gilmore!?” “Rushmore” is a film as self-possessed as its hero (and many times cooler), and that makes it a favorite for many, but it lacks the sentimental spark that galvanizes Anderson’s more mature work. —DEThe Wes Anderson movie that people think of when they think of Wes Anderson movies, “The Royal Tenenbaums” is a story about failure that’s told by someone who’s afraid of his own ambition (or, more precisely, afraid of his unwillingness to tame it). Unfolding like “Fanny and Alexander” as remade by a very drunk Whit Stillman, “The Royal Tenenbaums” is responsible for so many of the worst quirks of recent indie cinema, but it falls victim to exactly none of them. It’s a film where the characters are cobbled together from affects, but all manage to feel human. It’s a film that feels overstuffed to the gills, but one whose every moment is iconic — gather enough twentysomethings together, and their Tenenbaums tattoos could serve as storyboards for the entire script. It’s a film that leaves me a little cold every time I watch it, but always feels worth watching again. —DEWes Anderson’s career can be cut into two distinctly different parts: Before “Fantastic Mr. Fox,” and after “Fantastic Mr. Fox.” Stung by accusations of self-parody, Anderson could have eased off the gas after “The Darjeeling Limited” divided critics and inspired all sorts of talk about how the filmmaker had grown subservient to his own style. But rather admit that the tail was wagging the dog, Anderson snipped the damn thing off and let his next hero wear it as a necktie.He introduced himself to audiences as an aesthete, and every one of the films he made after “Bottle Rocket” had a little less breathable air than the last, but that was fine by Anderson. If anything, he wanted more control, he wanted to play God, he wanted to make something so airless that his characters wouldn’t even need to have lungs. And so he ventured into the painstaking world of stop-motion, working in a medium where literally nothing made its way on screen unless he thought to put it there. It turns out that yeah, everything else was just getting in the way.Flattering Roald Dahl’s (lovely) source material into a gloriously wry domestic comedy about compromise, belonging, and accepting one’s lot in life (be it in below ground or above), “Fantastic Mr. Fox” is more than just one of the most quotable films this side of “Casablanca,” it’s also an immaculate portrait of flawed “people” doing the best they can for themselves and each other. —DEA pre-pubescent “Badlands” that’s told with the endearingly pathetic quality of an elementary school play, “Moonrise Kingdom” is the rare American film that’s about children, but not necessarily for children (a schism that studios can’t seem to wrap their heads around, but one that artists like Robert Bresson, Ingmar Bergman, and Hayao Miyazaki have always been able to reconcile with ease). The movie begins with the most perfect premise that Wes Anderson has ever devised for himself: Two kids get together and try to run away from home, only to be stymied by the fact that they live on an island. If you squint, that pretty much sums up every Wes Anderson movie.But “Moonrise Kingdom” isn’t a story about being stuck, it’s a story about how the things we can’t escape are often the things that love us the most, about how the greatest myths are the ones we create for ourselves, about how everything is better when narrated by Bob Balaban. It’s like a mousetrap, it’s written with a whimsical Dickensian flair, and it’s filled with lines so evocative that merely reading them can bring the whole film back to life (“I love you, but you don’t know what you’re talking about”). Anderson has made a lifetime’s worth of family sagas, but none of his other movies so pointedly capture what it feels like to have a home. —DEThere will always be some debate as to whether or not “The Grand Budapest Hotel” is the best Wes Anderson movie, but there may be no denying that it’s the most Wes Anderson movie. The latest work from an artist who seems to become himself a little bit more with every film, this flawless, four-tiered confection is like a wedding cake filled with arsenic, a nostalgic comedy that functions like a requiem for itself.Anderson’s stories are about boys, men, or male foxes who seek to live in snow globes of their own design, ensconcing themselves in the empire of their own imaginations. Some of his films (e.g. “Moonrise Kingdom”) are about creating those magical spaces, but most of his stories are about the heartache of losing them, about the tragicomic process of building something new on top of the rubble. With “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” Anderson directly confronts the hermetic fantasy of his films, reaching into the not-too-distant past and exhuming the spirit of Stefan Zweig in order to mourn the world we lost, the civility that we’ve forgotten, and the beauty of creating beautiful things even when we know that the world will never let them survive.The film is so beautifully realized that Ralph Fiennes’ career-best performance almost feels like the cherry on top. Also: Willem Dafoe playing the best henchman who Bond never killed, and Tilda Swinton as a sexually active octogenarian. And Saoirse Ronan’s Mexico-shaped birthmark. Oh, and also the best line that Anderson has ever written, shrugged off like an afterthought in the first act: “You see, there are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity. Indeed, that’s what we provide in our own modest, humble, insignificant… oh, fuck it.” —DE",

        "title": "It’s a High Stakes Weekend at the Box Office for Both the DC and Pixar Franchises",
        "content": "Saying an upcoming weekend is crucial for box office is getting old, but in terms of the range of significant elements that are in play, this weekend is stand-out. And it’s not just “The Flash” (Warner Bros. Discovery) on the ropes. Pixar’s “Elemental” (Disney) also opens, and the stakes it represents might even be higher for the animated studio than the comic book-centric one.But the headline story is how “The Flash” performs. The elevation of a DC Comics character to a standalone, titular lead role also comes with the return of Michael Keaton as Batman. Its prime position mid-June, its expense, its centrality to DC as its universe hits the reset button all might suggest, at least under ideal circumstances, the film have a domestic opening at the $100 million or higher level.It almost certainly will not.Published projections sit around $70 million, although rival distribution and exhibitor sources are hopeful that it could reach the $80 million to $85 million mark. Credit WBD with playing a tricky hand well. The film’s media attention has mostly been about actor Ezra Miller’s behavior in the months leading up to its release. Other than a recent premiere red carpet appearance, Miller has not been on hand to publicize the film.An April CinemaCon screening provided positive reactions, while official reviews have been more mixed, though hardly damaging. Considering there was serious chatter about not even releasing the film at the height of Miller’s bad publicity, a $70 million debut (with that and more in foreign dollars) would be something of a victory. And if audience reaction is good then, unlike some comic book movies, the potential for an above average take is possible.“The Flash” wasn’t overseen by new DC chiefs James Gunn and Peter Safran who, irrespective of this film’s fate, are tasked with righting a ship that has seen rough waters. However this entry performs, this production group will continue unhindered.Pixar would likely happily switch places with DC. The vaunted animation unit has struggled in recent years with its latest releases, and almost certainly could hit bottom this weekend. Last June, their “Toy Story” spinoff “Lightyear” opened to $50 million. That was considered disappointing. “Elemental,” their latest, will be lucky to hit $40 milllion.Unlike the unit in its prime, “Elemental” isn’t even getting good reviews (56 on Metacritic). Ironically, it comes in what has already been a great (and profitable) year for animation, with two of the three biggest releases of 2023 (“The Super Mario Bros. Movie” and “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse”).Hit animated titles these days are some combination of franchise-related and comic book appeal. “Elemental” is a standalone original film, and though it has comic-like elements, it comes after multiple Pixar original titles that used marketing tactics that conveyed worthiness ahead of fun. That, and recently elevated Disney+ early or exclusive play for many theatrical titles, has reduced the sense of urgency audiences might feel when it comes to seeking them out on opening weekend.Again, even if the film’s opening is weak, a better sustained result might at least temper overall negativity. But the prospects are currently grim, and it is hard to see why Disney would continue to allocate high-end budgets for Pixar without significant revamping behind the scenes.Beyond these two releases, there are other indicators worthy of attention:Watch this number: what will the weekend total be? There’s potential for it to exceed $200 million, and that really is the minimum number needed to kickstart an otherwise tepid summer. The optimistic hope has been for a $4 billion season. After the first six weeks (about a third of the way in; “summer” for movies means early May through Labor Day), grosses are up only $4.8 percent from 2022. Reaching that target figure will require a 22 percent improvement the rest of the way. $200 million this weekend would be 21 percent better than last year, so it would be on target.Both “The Flash” and “Elemental” exceeding expectations would help. But other routes exist, and in some ways, it would be even better news if they did. How the current top three — “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” “Spider-Verse,” and “The Little Mermaid” hold will be a critical element. Hitting the target summer gross requires an expanded audience and multiple films performing well at the same time.Those three titles grossed $140 million last weekend. Based on weekday numbers, #1 “Transformers” could see a dip of 55 percent or more. Can the other two drop less, and do so while the new films reach their share of viewers? Watch this result carefully.Also worth watching: a third new wide release. Lionsgate has Tim Story’s low-budget Toronto 2022-premiered “The Blackening.” The horror/comedy film has an appropriate Juneteenth theme for the holiday, strong reviews, and a recent splashy Tribeca premiere to elevate it. It’s an atypical mid-June release, but if it overperforms, it would be another sign of a risky date getting rewarded.Look for more signs for more specialized green shoots. Wes Anderson’s “Asteroid City” (Focus) opens in six New York/Los Angeles theaters, with a chance it might outgross the strong start for “Past Lives” (A24). Celine Song’s “Past Lives” continues it old-style slow rollout with 85 theaters this weekend. Though only a small part of the total, it’s hard to underestimate how vital these two releases are for this struggling sector, which needs all the wins it can get.",

        "content": "Samuel L. Jackson is waiting to visit Wakanda in the MCU.The Marvel staple, who plays Nick Fury in the superhero franchise, told Entertainment Tonight that he would prefer to be in “every Marvel movie” instead of the role being “up and down.”“I don’t know, it’s kind of up and down for me in an interesting sort of way,” Jackson said since playing Fury since “Iron Man” in 2008. “Feels like I’ve been playing him forever. If I had it my way, I would’ve been in every Marvel movie because, I mean, he is Nick Fury, he knows everything that’s going on. I’m still trying to figure out why I’ve never been to Wakanda.”Jackson reprises the role for Disney+ series “Secret Invasion” but was not approached to appear in “Black Panther” nor the Oscar-nominated sequel “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.”“They didn’t ask me to go, but I’m still trying to get there,” Jackson said. “I need a ticket.”Jackson recently addressed longtime collaborator Quentin Tarantino’s comments about the “Marvel-ization” of Hollywood driven by IP over star power. Jackson argued that audiences can’t “refute” the cultural iconography of MCU stars like late “Black Panther” actor Chadwick Boseman.“It takes an actor to be those particular characters, and the sign of movie stardom has always been, what, asses in seats? What are we talking about?” Jackson said on “The View” earlier this year. “That’s not a big controversy for me to know that apparently these actors are movie stars. Chadwick Boseman is Black Panther. You can’t refute that, and he’s a movie star.”Jackson previously explained why he’d “rather be Nick Fury” than be “doing statue-chasing movies” in hopes of an Oscar.“As jaded as I wanted to be about it, you know thinking, ‘Well, I should have won an Oscar for this or should have won for that and it didn’t happen,’ once I got over it many years ago, it wasn’t a big deal for me,” the “Pulp Fiction” actor told the Los Angeles Times. “I always have fun going to the Oscars. I always look forward to getting a gift basket for being a presenter. But otherwise, I was past it. I was never going to let the Oscars be a measure of my success or failure as an actor. My yardstick of success is my happiness: Am I satisfied with what I’m doing? I’m not doing statue-chasing movies. You know, ‘If you do this movie, you’ll win an Oscar.’ No, thanks. I’d rather be Nick Fury. Or having fun being Mace Windu with a lightsaber in my hand.”",

        "content": "Guillermo del Toro is sticking to his art form, regardless of “assholes” in Hollywood.The Oscar winner called out the film industry for being “geared toward grinding out shit and destroying your art” during the Annecy animation festival (via The Hollywood Reporter). Del Toro revealed that five of his projects were turned down by studios in the last two months.“They still say no to me,” the “Nightmare Alley” director said. “In the last two months, they said no to five of my projects. So it doesn’t go away. Making movies is eating a sandwich of shit. There’s always shit, just sometimes you get a little more bread with yours.”He added, “The rate of productivity against your efforts will remain frustratingly difficult, and frustratingly long. And you will always encounter assholes. But have faith in the stories you want to tell and wait until someone wants to buy them.”Del Toro also said that he will be focusing primarily on animated feature films going forward following his stop-motion adaptation of “Pinocchio” and the upcoming “Buried Giant,” based on Kazuo Ishiguro’s novel. Both films come from Netflix.“There are a couple more live-action movies I want to do but not many,” del Toro said. “After that, I only want to do animation. That’s the plan.”The “Shape of Water” director continued, “Animation to me is the purest form of art, and it’s been kidnapped by a bunch of hoodlums. We have to rescue it. [And] I think that we can Trojan-horse a lot of good shit into the animation world. I believe you can make an adult fantasy drama with stop-motion and move people emotionally. I think stop-motion can be intravenous, it can go straight to your emotions in a way that no other medium can.”Del Toro previously told IndieWire’s Eric Kohn in November 2022 that the experience on “Pinocchio” led him to rethink his past films in terms of animated potential.“I want to focus on animation a lot more. It is much more my speed,” del Toro said. “Could you do an animated version of ‘The Shape of Water?’” he wondered before answering his own question. “I don’t think so. Could you do a version of ‘Pan’s Labyrinth’? Maybe, I think so.”",

        "title": "Disney’s Queer Track Record: A Troubled History",
        "content": "In Ron DeSantis’ astonishingly pointless vendetta against Walt Disney World, it seems the Florida governor’s favorite insult to use against the corporation is “wokeness.” Ever since former CEO Bob Chapek criticized the governor’s homophobic and transphobic Parental Rights in Education Act — which forbids discussion of gender and sexual identity in public schools — DeSantis and his supporters have repeatedly accused the entertainment conglomerate of “echoing Democrat propaganda,” and engaged in a vicious legal battle over Disney World’s self-governing tax status that’s proved a huge headache for the state.To hear DeSantis tell it, you’d think Disney World was a paradise for gays, and Mickey himself threw the first brick at Stonewall. That’s hyperbole, yes, but not by much. The reality makes Disney look far less rosy. For starters, Chapek (who has since been fired and replaced with his predecessor Bob Iger) initially stayed mum on the act — even as multiple other companies took active stances against the bill and the public turned on companies donating to the anti-LGBTQ legislators sponsoring it. In fact, Chapek’s first official response was a company memo, in which he said the company would avoid taking a public stance, and would instead make an impact via “the inspiring content we produce.”After the memo released, many LGBTQ Disney employees and their allies blasted the company for how it handles gay representation. Pixar workers released a letter claiming the company actively blocks the inclusion of same-sex affection and romance in their films, and ultimately staged a walkout in protest in March 2022. The public mutiny forced Disney to eventually reverse course; first by reincorporating a cut gay kiss from the “Toy Story” spinoff “Lightyear” (it lasted all of one second in the end), and finally pulling funding from anti-LGBTQ sponsors and criticizing DeSantis’ bill — which nevertheless passed on March 28, 2022. It was a public relations disaster for Disney, one that seems to mark a turning point in the very messy history between the House of Mouse and the American LGBTQ community.Disney and the queer community have always made for strange, awkward bedfellows. On one hand, queer subtext runs galore in many of the films; gay Disney fans are a very real (and, let’s be honest, lucrative) phenomenon; and many of the most important creators in the company’s history are out and proud members of the LGBTQ community.But Disney is also famously protective of its brand and reputation as “family friendly.” Disney executives tend to be hesitant about featuring gay characters in films in order to maintain a conservative image — and marketability in countries with homophobic censorship laws. The result is a company with a lot of gay employees that regularly pays lip service to including everyone, but rarely measures up to even the lowest standards of inclusion. Read on for a look at Disney’s long, troubled history with LGBTQ people.There’s shockingly little to dissect in how Disney treated its gay characters and gay employees in the company’s earliest years. That’s because Disney maintained the status quo by doing what every other studio did, and largely pretended they didn’t exist for much of the 20th century. That said, there were several films from this time that leaned on queer stereotypes, or lent themselves to gay readings.Early shorts like “Ferdinand the Bull” (1939) and “The Reluctant Dragon” (1941) focused on characters, like a bull that loves to smell flowers or a shy bookish dragon, whose alienation from conventional gender expectations were easy to interpret as queer. As more films were made by the company, several queer-coded villains were also introduced, such as the dandyish Captain Hook in 1953’s “Peter Pan.” But these bursts of representation were nothing compared to the deluge of queer-coded characters that would arrive following the company’s late ’80s renaissance. (More on that below.)There’s also the matter of Disney Theme Parks, which are an entire topic in themselves.For years, Disneyland and Disney World had policies preventing attendees of the same gender from dancing with each other while at the facilities. The policy was introduced in 1957, when Disneyland first introduced venues intended for dancing. In a Los Angeles Times story from 1985, a spokesperson for the parks, Al Flores, said the policy was intended as a “crowd-control measure” to protect women and to avoid offending guests.In 1980, two gay teen boys were removed from a dance floor in the Tomorrowland park area by security. The men filed a lawsuit, and in 1984 Orange County Superior Court ruled in favor of them. However, Disney’s lawyer William M. Bitting said in a statement after the decision that the order will not apply to others, and “If two (other) men show up tomorrow night to dance, Disneyland won’t let them on the dance floor.”Disneyland ultimately lifted the policy the next year in 1985. Officially, the decision was made due to requests from patrons of Videopolis, a (now-shuttered) teen dance venue.“Videopolis brings in a lot of teen-aged kids, and we see a lot of situations where two girls come together and want to dance and ask to. We have always said no, but we changed our minds,” Flores said at the time. According to Time Magazine, same-sex parkgoers were still barred from doing slow dances together until 1989, after Disney dropped the policy in response to another lawsuit.When Disney rose up from its commercial and cultural low point of the ’80s, a lot of its newfound success could be attributed to the work of LGBTQ creators. Howard Ashman, in particular, was one of the driving forces between Disney’s early ’90s creative Renaissance, writing music for “The Little Mermaid,” “Beauty and the Beast,” and “Aladdin” before his death from AIDS in 1991. The highest grossing film from the studio during the ’90s — and its highest-grossing 2D animated film of all time — was 1994’s “The Lion King,” which featured music from venerable gay icon Elton John.Another LGBTQ creator who rose to prominence at the company during the ’90s was Andreas Deja, who worked as a supervising animator on many of the company’s most famous films. Deja specialized in animating villains, including Jaffar in “Aladdin,” Gaston in “Beauty and the Beast,” and Scar in “The Lion King.” All three characters have been analyzed by various critics as gay coded, and blatant gay subtext exists in all three films. The eponymous song “Gaston” in “Beauty and the Beast,” for example, features several men praising the brawny chauvinist through innuendo-laden, homoerotic lyrics.These weren’t the only villains queer coded by Disney. Ursula, the villainous sea witch of “The Little Mermaid,” was patterned directly on the famous drag queen Divine. This queer coding has been criticized by some scholars as homophobic, while others in the LGBTQ community have embraced the villain as a symbol of feminist (and/or lesbian) rage. Several other movies from the ’90s have been read through an LGBTQ lens; the most obvious of which is “Mulan.” The gender-swap classic features a girl disguising herself as a man, and has been interpreted by some as transgender allegory.So, what was it like being a gay employee at Disney during this creative peak? Complicated. On the one hand, when Ashman was diagnosed with HIV, the company supported him and built a production unit near his New York City home so he could continue working while receiving treatment during production of “Aladdin.” In 1994, “The Lion King” executive producer Thomas Schumacher — who still works at the company as the president of its theatrical wing — told The Advocate that “a lot of gay people at every level” work at Disney, and that, while some executives were uncomfortable seeing him with his partner at a retreat, the environment at the company was overall very supportive.On the other hand, the company was one of the very last in Hollywood to offer health care coverage to the domestic partners of LGBTQ employees. The company officially made the move in 1996, after many studios had already expanded their health care plans to be more inclusive in response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Things at the Parks weren’t much better. In 1991, shortly after its homophobic dancing policies were lifted, Disney World became the host of “Gay Days,” an unofficial event where LGBTQ community members could visit the resort during the first Sunday of June.Gay Days grew into one of the biggest events for Disney World, attracting over 100,000 attendees. But Disney wouldn’t officially sponsor the event, and its handling in the early years was rough. In 1994, the company posted signs outside the park warning straight attendees that “members of the gay community have chosen to visit the Magic Kingdom today in their recognition of Gay and Lesbian Pride Month.”In 1998, an off-shoot of Disney World’s Gay Days was established at Disneyland. Years later, Disneyland Gay Day cofounder Eddie Shapiro told Time Magazine that Disney would placate straight parkgoers by handing out free white shirts to customers who unknowingly wore red, the signature color of the event. Refunds would be provided to any straight patron who complained about gay guests.“Those were conversations that had to be had with Disney each step of the way to say, ‘Hey, by the way, that’s the definition of homophobia,’” Shapiro told Time Magazine. “Those kinds of things had to be pointed out and fought for.”Not much of note was reported about the treatment of LGBTQ people by Disney during the first decade of the 21st century. But that’s not because Disney was actively supporting employees or fans.Gay creators continued to be prominent at all levels of the company; for example, Kenny Ortega, who directed movies like “Newsies” and “Hocus Pocus” during the ’90s, delivered Disney Channel its defining hit with the camp classic “High School Musical” trilogy. The series featured musical theater obsessed Ryan (Lucas Grabeel) in its ensemble, and the character is one of the most blatantly queer-coded in Disney’s history. Years later, Ortega said that although Disney had the “most progressive group of people I’ve ever worked with,” he chose not to make the character explicitly gay out of concern that the company wasn’t ready to take that step in representation.Coding and hints as the only form of representation was essentially the norm for Disney characters (and characters in all media for kids, in fairness) during the 2000s. “The Proud Family” featured the character of Michael (voiced by Phil LaMarr), an effeminate friend of main character Penny (Kyla Pratt). When the show, which aired from 2001 to 2005, was revived for Disney+ as “Louder and Prouder,” the character was depicted as openly gay, and creator Ralph Farquhar said they had to use “code” to portray the character as queer in the original run.Is Elsa, the ice-spewing queen voiced by Idina Menzel in Disney’s modern blockbuster “Frozen,” gay? In the minds of most fans, that’s a very definite “yes.” The character doesn’t have any love interests in the original 2013 film or its 2019 sequel, but does have a storyline around accepting herself and the secret she hides from conventional society. Not to mention, she sings several songs (“Let it Go,” “Show Yourself”) that many have interpreted as metaphors for coming out.But Disney has been resistant to confirming the very obvious subtext surrounding Elsa in the films, leaving the confirmation only to fan art and Onion headlines. In interviews, creators involved with the films have emphasized the importance of Elsa as a Disney Princess who doesn’t pursue romance, and instead focuses on her own self-improvement and her relationship with her sister. That’s all well-and-good, but a) we’ve since received more independent princesses without romances like Moana and b) the coyness struck many as Disney trying to have its cake and eat it too: moulding Elsa into a gay icon without running the risk of offending people who wouldn’t take kindly to the idea of a gay Disney princess.Following the first “Frozen,” Disney began making its first real — if extremely slight — inroads for LGBTQ representation in its films and shows. A 2014 episode of Disney Channel’s “Good Luck Charlie” drew protests from hate groups after it featured a lesbian couple as minor characters. In 2017, an episode of Disney Junior’s “Doc McStuffins” introduced another pair of lesbian mothers, marking a first for the pre-school channel.Other shows that featured minor gay representation during this time period include “Star vs. the Forces of Evil,” which saw supporting character Jackie enter a same sex relationship in a 2019 episode. In 2016, the series finale of the beloved animated series “Gravity Falls” confirmed that the characters of Sheriff Blubs and Deputy Durland were a couple; a sweet moment, but one that felt out of step with the times after Cartoon Network’s “Steven Universe” had more explicitly gay representation baked in from the beginning. “Gravity Falls” creator Alex Hirsch would later call out the company for removing LGBTQ content from the series over the course of its run.In 2017, director Bill Condon revealed in an interview with Attitude that the “Beauty and the Beast” live-action remake would feature what he called an “exclusively gay moment” involving the character of LeFou (Josh Gad). That “exclusively gay moment” amounted to LeFou dancing with another man for five seconds in the film’s climax. The discrepancy between how it was promoted and its laughably minor reality was widely mocked, and Gad even eventually apologized for it. But that was just the beginning of similar press rounds about so-called “boundary-breaking” representation from the company.Other “first” gay characters from Disney that have popped up include: an unnamed man played by Joe Russo, who briefly mentions dating another man in a scene from “Avengers: Endgame”; the lesbians in “Rise of Skywalker,” who inadvertently birthed an iconic meme; the background lesbian moms in “Toy Story 4”; a cyclops cop in “Onward”; supporting characters in “Cruella” and “Jungle Cruise,” who don’t actually say they’re gay; and Brian Tyree Henry’s superhero in “Eternals.” Aside from the arguable exception of “Eternals,” all of these characters have felt like insulting baby steps for Disney.In 2021, after the release of the film “Raya and the Last Dragon,” Kelly Marie Tran, who voiced the title character, said she played the role as queer, and intentionally added romantic subtext to the relationship between Raya and her rival Namaari (Gemma Chan). She said this wasn’t Disney’s official position, but called for the company to do better on queer rep going forward.Another Disney project featuring obvious but non-explicit gay themes to come out that year was “Luca,” a Pixar film about an intimate friendship between two young boys. Disney conversely faced criticism in 2021 after execs cancelled an animated film adaptation of webcomic “Nimona,” from the now-dissolved Blue Sky Studios, which featured a love story between two men; the film has since been rescued and will premiere on Netflix in June 2023.As Disney’s queer representation on film stalled into nothingness, things did begin to turn around on TV — at least somewhat. 2017 saw the premiere of the show “Andi Mack,” a slightly more serious Disney Channel sitcom, and the show’s second and third seasons focused on the character Cryus Goodman (Joshua Rush), who grapples with his sexuality and comes out of the closet. Gay and queer characters were also prominently featured in the “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series” spinoff on Disney+, which premiered in 2020. Disney+ also hosted a short from Pixar, “Out,” which focused explicitly on the difficulties of coming out as gay.Disney Channel also premiered “The Owl House” — an animated show that focuses on the same sex relationship between characters Luz and Amity — in 2020, making it the first animated series with a queer lead character in the channel’s history. The show, which concluded after three seasons earlier this year, also featured a non-binary character in the form of coven head Raine.Dana Terrace, the creator of “The Owl House” and a bisexual woman, has been outspoken about having to fight to feature queer representation on the show. Terrace was also one of the most outspoken Disney employees against Chapek during the Don’t Say Gay controversy, calling his initial statement “flowery and compassionate words to shut you up.”Last year, Disney released “Strange World,” which featured Jaboukie Young-White voicing Ethan, the gay teenage son of the main character. Refreshingly, neither the film nor its marketing nor the press made a particularly big deal out of the inclusion of a gay lead, treating it in a matter-of-fact way that felt far more authentic and respectful than the “exclusively” gay characters of old. The movie did bomb at the box office, but that was likely more due to the issues with marketing than Ethan — in spite of what some right-wing commentators suggested at the time.As Disney has effectively burned bridges with conservatives via the Disney World lawsuit, there’s a possibility that the company will be a bit more willing to feature non-straight characters openly; if Disney has already alienated anti-LGBTQ audiences and sponsors, it can’t make any money by appeasing them. New shows released by Disney since then have had more open representation; see this year’s “Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur,” which features “Pose” star Indya Moore as an openly trans middle schooler.It’s certainly depressing that Disney is only beginning to improve on how it has handled queer characters after getting bullied into it, but based on its less than magical track record, that’s about as happy of an ending as you could expect from the House of Mouse.",

        "title": "Bryan Cranston Reveals ‘Asteroid City’ Had No Call Sheet: The Cast Is ‘All Equal’",
        "content": "Wes Anderson wanted the “Asteroid City” ensemble to feel like a theater troupe.According to actor Bryan Cranston, the auteur filmmaker did not have a “hierarchy” call sheet for the A-list ensemble cast — which includes Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, Steve Carell, Maya Hawke, Jason Schwartzman, Jeffrey Wright, Tilda Swinton, Margot Robbie, and Jeff Goldblum.“Wes, the word ‘auteur’ has been thrown around so much, but it is applicable to him,” Cranston told IndieWire on the red carpet for the “Asteroid City” New York City premiere Tuesday night. “He is a man who is kind, not just in his creativity but in his spirit and generosity. He is vulnerable and open and sweet and so creative, so specific, complex in all the best ways. And when you do a film with him, you are part of a company. This is what actors crave, this community.”The “Breaking Bad” star plays the narrator of “Asteroid City,” which centers on adults and youngsters gathering for a stargazing convention in an American desert town. Cranston previously lent his voice to Anderson’s 2018 “Isle of Dogs” but is featured on camera throughout “Asteroid” in interstices between the film’s three acts.Cranston continued, “Every single night we would get together for dinner, all of us, every night. I’ve never experienced that before. There are no trailers, there is no hierarchy, there is no call sheet. There is no ‘star’ and you’re under them. We’re all equal, in a socialistic kind of way. And it really works.”A call sheet typically tells actors where they need to be on a given day, with top-billed stars at the head of the sheet.Writer-director Anderson previously admitted that COVID-19 production protocols worked in favor of his ensemble film, which eventually does center around an actual quarantine as the town grapples with a possible alien invasion.“The making of the movie during COVID protocols, it really suited us. It worked for us,” Anderson said at the Cannes Film Festival. “I loved that we formed a troupe and stayed together and sat at a long table and had dinner.”The “French Dispatch” director earlier told IndieWire that he considers his frequent collaborators like Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, and Schwartzman as part of his personal “family.” He added, “I always love having new people. It just expands the whole range of it. You know, we have other movies.”Anderson also this week confirmed that Murray — featured in Anderson films like “Rushmore,” “The Royal Tenenbaums,” and “The Life Aquatic” — was supposed to star in “Asteroid City” before the actor caught COVID. His character was later played by Carell.“My experience with Bill is so extensive. Bill was such a great supporter of me from the very beginning,” Anderson said amid misconduct claims against Murray. “I don’t want to speak about somebody else’s experience, but he’s really part of my family. You know, he’s my daughter’s godfather. In fact, he actually baptized her. He’s the one who splashed the water.” (Murray was spotted at the film’s premiere after-party in Manhattan on Tuesday.)Focus Features opens “Asteroid City” in select theaters on June 16.",

        "title": "Why Are Oscar Documentary Prospects So Sparse This Year?",
        "content": "In early summer, the still-slim Oscar conversation around documentary contenders got an unexpected bump: from an Emmy contender.When the team behind AppleTV+’s “Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie” realized that the field of Oscar contenders was thinner than usual, the Davis Guggenheim-directed doc entered the fray. Right now, the film about the hugely popular TV and film star fighting off the vicissitudes of Parkinson’s and reflecting on his past looks good not only for an Emmy nomination, but Oscar rules make it possible to double dip and also pick up an Oscar nod.But it doesn’t work the other way. Only if a movie does not land an Oscar nomination can it then submit for the Emmy race, as Brett Morgen’s “Jane” did in 2017. But given the weak Oscar competition this year, “Still,” with superb reviews for its innovative filmmaking — which elevates it beyond the usual hagiographic celebrity documentaries that are so popular these days — has a chance at both the Emmy and the Oscar.One thing we can count on if that happens: the Oscars will change the rules again. “The world is upside down right now,” said filmmaker Morgan Neville at this week’s Tribeca Film Festival. “Everything about the industry has changed. And everybody knows this. Some of these films are going for Emmys before they go for Oscars.”That doesn’t change one thing: the Oscar field is very light this year — here’s why.With a rickety theatrical market for non-fiction fare, and a drastically curtailed number of active documentary buyers, many Sundance films did not get picked up for distribution. So far, only one of 12 competition films to date has announced a buyer. (Clearly, Sundance 2023 did not offer a commercial slate of non-fiction films.) Usually the Sundance programmers cherry-pick the best non-fiction content available: it’s the top American festival for docs, and often supplies as many as four of the final Oscar nominated films every year.Last year at this time, three Sundance grads — eventual Oscar nominees “Fire of Love” (Neon), “All that Breathes” (HBO), and the winner, “Navalny” (CNN) — were already campaigning.“It’s a perfect storm of confusion and fear,” said Submarine seller Josh Braun. “Because it’s the one thing everyone felt was reliable and predictable: you go to Sundance and a number of docs would sell. It’s the first year since I’ve been doing this that this has happened.”“The old independent model of documentary is not happening right now,” said Oscar winner and former Academy governor Roger Ross Williams (“Music by Prudence”), “where you make a doc about a regular person or a real situation, and you raise the financing with grants and some equity, and you take it to a festival, and then you hope to get a sale. No one’s buying what was sold at Sundance. So that’s not working. It’s really scary for those filmmakers who are still making those documentaries.”Williams’ production company produced indie doc “Master of Light,” a mass incarceration story that was financed by now-defunct Vulcan Film and grant money, from Rosa Ruth Boesten, “a first-time filmmaker, queer filmmaker out of the Netherlands,” said Williams. The film won the Grand Jury Prize at SXSW 2022, won Best Doc at San Francisco International Film Festival, and Best First Feature at Sheffield. Only then did HBO fall for the film and buy it. But that’s a miracle story, not one that repeats every day.Word is, veteran documentarians Joe Brewster and Michèle Stephenson’s rigorous probe into feminist poetry and politics, 2023 Sundance Grand Jury Prize winner “Going to Mars: The Nikki Giovanni Project,” is going to wind up at HBO. (HBO has not confirmed.) “That’s a film that people will get behind,” said Williams. “They’re loved by the community.”And one of the stronger films in this year’s uneven selection, Nicole Newnham’s “The Disappearance of Shere Hite,” a portrait of the embattled and glamorous sex researcher and feminist pioneer, finally sold to IFC Films and Sapan Studios. Another film that could build a following is Lena Waithe-backed transgender sex workers story “Kokomo City” (July 28, Magnolia), which won both jury and audience awards at Sundance NEXT and the Audience Award at the Berlinale Panorama.If enough people catch up with it and it lands a distributor, U.S. Documentary Director prize winner “A Still, Small Voice,” Luke Lorentzen’s follow-up to Oscar-shortlisted “Midnight Family,” could find some supporters.One Sundance film that should resonate with Oscar voters belongs to the popular icon biopic genre, Lisa Cortés’ well-reviewed “Little Richard: I Am Everything” (Magnolia/Max). But while CNN Films was an early enthusiastic backer, the documentary unit has been trimmed back and its chief, Amy Entelis, is busy filling in for the ousted Chris Licht. Still, with backing from both the Jann Wenner family and Mick Jagger, if CNN gets on board, “Little Richard” has a chance to follow “Navalny” as another Oscar contender.So far Neon, HBO, and Sony Pictures Classics didn’t buy anything at Sundance. “Not as many documentaries popped out of Sundance as normal,” said one manager at the Tribeca Film Festival. “It’s helpful to put more films on the map. Usually by now, the documentary race is already underway. You know three or four of the final five. And now so few films sold out of Sundance. It’s hard out there because the streamers aren’t buying. And movies that are getting financed are about celebrities or true crime.”For his part, Williams directed two of the eight episodes and executive produced the Oprah Winfrey-backed “The 1619 Project” (Hulu). Two-time Oscar nominee Liz Garbus (“What Happened, Miss Simone?”) took on the high-profile six-episode “Harry and Meghan” series for Netflix, where Cynthia Wade stretched her “MerPeople” to four episodes, and Lesley Chilcott laid out “Arnold” in three. And Morgan Neville’s upcoming Steve Martin documentary (AppleTV+) plays out in two parts.Not only Little Richard and Michael J. Fox, but in recent years celebrity subjects Val Kilmer, Sidney Poitier, Louis Armstrong, Taylor Swift, Brooke Shields, Mary Tyler Moore, Joan Baez, Yogi Berra, Dan Rather, Ed Sullivan, Harry Belafonte, Rock Hudson, Stan Lee, and more have commanded documentary attention. And top documentary directors have devoted their time: R.J. Cutler (Billie Eilish), Neville (Bono & the Edge, Paul McCartney), Alex Gibney (Paul Simon, Boris Becker), Williams (Donna Summer), Matthew Heineman (Jon Batiste), and Dawn Porter (Lady Bird).Some celebrity biographies are more hagiographic and promotional than others. “I love watching and consuming biodocs,” said the manager. “But we should think about having them under a different name other than documentary, especially where you have these celebrities not only cooperating but also producing.”In an atmosphere where fear reigns in the executive ranks, not taking chances is a survival strategy, and so is cozying up to celebrities. “We’re all adjusting to the shift in the industry,” said Williams. “All these corporate mergers, and everyone’s trying to figure out what’s going on. And right now, what seems like the only safe bet for the big buyers are celebrity docs. They’re grabbing the best talent to make [them]. The big names are going where the money is. As someone who has a production company who wants to keep people employed, I also have to do celebrity docs in order to keep my employees. I’m trying to employ BIPOC people, people of color, people who traditionally don’t have the same opportunities. So I have to go where the money is.”Current Academy rules dictate a one-week Oscar-qualifying run in New York, Los Angeles, the Bay Area, Chicago, Miami, and Atlanta. That costs money, as does inclusion in major and regional festivals, International Documentary Association screenings and other doc series with Q&As.“The traditional theatrical runs of documentaries that tended to establish the field aren’t really happening,” said Neville. “Films that felt like they might have more Oscar weight are getting put on streaming services very quickly, whether it’s ‘Little Richard’ or Michael J. Fox or whatever. They’re already streaming it. The older model was: let them percolate in the culture for six months or more. And then it reveals itself.”All is not lost with a small distributor and marketing budget, though. “The documentary branch has been good at rewarding quality documentaries,” said Williams, “regardless of their commercial potential.” For a movie to break through that doesn’t have a serious campaign behind it, “there has to be Academy doc branch members who champion it, like ‘Writing with Fire.'”Filmmakers like Williams (Netflix’s “Stamped from the Beginning”) are eagerly awaiting news on which fall festivals will accept their submissions. Telluride? Venice? Toronto? New York?Laura Poitras won her first Oscar for “Citizenfour” (Radius TWC) after premiering at NYFF, while her second nomination for “All the Beauty and the Bloodshed” (Neon) arrived after winning the Golden Lion in Venice (and playing NYFF again). Raoul Peck’s Oscar-nominated “I Am Not Your Negro” (Magnolia) premiered in TIFF before playing New York. And Oscar-winner “Free Solo” (NatGeo) debuted in Telluride before playing Toronto.Several of the films that did not make a big splash at earlier festivals have a chance to gain more ground at the fall festivals.In recent years, as the documentary Oscar branch has grown, it has become more international. This year it may move from more than 30 percent international to more like 40 percent, said one veteran Oscar campaigner.Movies like “All that Breathes” and “Writing with Fire,” from India, Oscar winner “My Octopus Teacher,” from Australia, “Flee” from Denmark, “Honeyland” from Macedonia, and “The Mole Agent” from Chile filmmaker Maite Alberdi have all wound up in the Oscar race. In fact, Alberdi could be back with Berlin entry and winner of the Sundance World Cinema documentary jury prize, “Eternal Memory” (August, MTV Documentary Films) a heart-tugging romance about Alzheimer’s that is sure to play for the older Academy crowd that embraced Michael Haneke’s “Amour.”Said one influential marketing rep, “There’s weirdly more than normal international films in the mix than American films this year.”Sundance World Cinema entries that could build followings include Pulitzer Prize winner Mstyslav Chernov’s timely war journalist story “20 Days in Mariupol” (August, Frontline/PBS), which won the Audience Award, along with North Korean exposé “Beyond Utopia,” which is still seeking distribution.Having distribution is always a plus: Kino Lorber will push Berlin Golden Bear winner “On the Adamant,” about a floating psychiatric care center, from Nicolas Philibert.At Cannes, three-time documentary Oscar nominee Wim Wenders debuted 3D artist portrait “Anselm,” about Anselm Kiefer, which should find North American distribution. Cannes entry “The Mother of All Lies” won Best Directing in Un Certain Regard, and tied for the Best Documentary award with edgy three-hour Competition title “Four Daughters.” Jury chief Kirsten Johnson (Emmy-winning “Dick Johnson Is Dead”) will be talking up both titles stateside; they still need distribution.Several European documentaries could enter the race later on, as did last year’s surprise Sundance nominee “A House Made of Splinters” — assuming they get some backing.Stay tuned. This year, more than ever, the documentary Oscar race remains in flux.",

        "title": "‘Rust’ Prosecutors Accuse Film’s Armorer of ‘Likely’ Being Hungover While Loading the Gun",
        "content": "Prosecutors in the “Rust” case are accusing the film‘s armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed of “likely” being hung over when she loaded the gun with the bullet that ultimately killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, something her lawyers have called “character assassination.”While charges against “Rust” star Alec Baldwin were dismissed, Gutierrez-Reed remains charged with a count of involuntary manslaughter in the “Rust” case. And on Friday, June 9, prosecutors in New Mexico responded to her lawyer’s motion to dismiss those charges.The special prosecutors in their response wrote off the motion as “laughable” but also revealed that they will have witness testimony that Gutierrez-Reed was drinking and smoking in the evenings leading up to the “Rust” shooting.“Witnesses in the current case will testify that Defendant Gutierrez was drinking heavily and smoking marijuana in the evenings during the shooting of ‘Rust.’ It is likely that Defendant Gutierrez was hung over when she inserted a live bullet into a gun that she knew was going to be used at some point by an actor while filming a shooting scene with other actors and crew members,” special prosecutors Kari T. Morrissey and Jason J. Lewis said. “The crime of involuntary manslaughter was designed specifically for this type of circumstance. Defendant Gutierrez has a history of reckless conduct that has resulted in loss of human life and it is in the public interest that she finally be held accountable.”In a statement to IndieWire in response, attorney Jason Bowles said, “The prosecution has so mishandled this case and the case is so weak that they are now resorting to character assassination tactics to further taint the jury pool. This investigation and prosecution has not been about seeking Justice; for them it’s been about finding a convenient scapegoat.”Marijuana use became legal in New Mexico in June 2021 ahead of the “Rust” incident in October 2021, though some employers are permitted to forbid it.A preliminary hearing for Gutierrez-Reed is scheduled between August 9-16, at which point a judge will determine if there’s probable cause for the case against Gutierrez-Reed to proceed. Gutierrez-Reed was charged on January 31.The response from the special prosecutors also mentions that they’ll make a final decision about whether to bring any new charges against Baldwin within the next 60 days. The involuntary manslaughter charges brought against him were dropped back in April.The “Rust” case has gone through some upheaval since Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed were first charged, including both the original special prosecutor and the state’s district attorney stepping down from the case, and with prosecutors needing to revise and downgrade the involuntary manslaughter charges brought against both Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed. Meanwhile, filming resumed on “Rust” back on April 21 in Montana, with Baldwin returning to the starring role. Gutierrez-Reed was not involved in the restarted production.Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed on October 21, 2021 when a gun held by Baldwin and carrying a live round discharged, fatally wounding Hutchins and injuring the film’s director Joel Souza.",

        "content": "Randall Park is fresh off his directorial debut.The “Fresh Off the Boat” sitcom star and “Always Be My Maybe” actor helmed millennial coming-of-age “Shortcomings,” starring Justin H. Min. The film, written by Adrian Tomine and based on Tomine’s 2007 graphic novel of the same name, also stars Sherry Cola, Ally Maki, Debby Ryan, Tavi Gevinson, Sonoya Mizuno, Jacob Batalon, and Timothy Simons.In “Shortcomings,” Ben (Min), a struggling filmmaker, lives in Berkeley, California, with his girlfriend, Miko (Cola), who works for a local Asian American film festival. When he’s not managing an arthouse movie theater as his day job, Ben spends his time obsessing over unavailable blonde women, watching Criterion Collection DVDs, and eating in diners with his best friend Alice (Maki), a queer grad student with a serial dating habit. When Miko moves to New York for an internship, Ben is left to his own devices, and begins to explore what he thinks he might want. “Shortcomings” premiered at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival and went on to play at this year’s Tribeca Film Festival. Director Park told IndieWire at Sundance that the film adaptation had been in the works for 15 years since the graphic novel debuted.“I first fell in love with [the book] when it came out back in 2007. And I always wanted to see it as a movie,” Park said. “I was around the same age as Ben. And I was like, ‘Gosh, I’d love to play Ben. That would be so cool.’ But that was never going to be made into a movie at that time especially. Just over the years, I just kept thinking about that book and then found out that Adrian had written a script and they were looking for directors. I made a pitch because I was so passionate about the material and I had been thinking about it as a movie for so long that I came up with this elaborate pitch and joined the project and brought my production company along. It just felt like it all came together magically, a lot of serendipity.”“Shortcomings” premieres August 4 in theaters from Sony Pictures Classics. Check out the trailer below.",

        "title": "Saved by Annapurna and Netflix, ‘Nimona’ Is a Breakthrough Queer Mainstream Animated Film",
        "content": "Netflix‘s “Nimona” marks an LGBTQ breakthrough for a mainstream animated film (the trailer launches Wednesday, coinciding with the Annecy premiere and ahead of the June 30 streaming debut). Based on ND Stevenson’s best-selling queer graphic novel about the titular teen shapeshifter (Chloë Grace Moretz) in a futuristic medieval world, “Nimona” explores timely issues of identity and xenophobia. It additionally pushes 2D stylization into 3D with a uniquely illustrated look.“Nimona” is also a minor miracle. It was rescued from the dead by Annapurna Animation and Netflix after Disney halted production in 2021 when they shuttered Fox-owned Blue Sky Studios, where the project originated. As it was, the film’s LGBTQ themes were watered down and a same-sex kiss between bestie knights (voiced by Riz Ahmed and Eugene Lee Yang) was a cause of concern at Disney.But former Blue Sky co-presidents Andrew Millstein and Robert Baird refused to let “Nimona” die in 2021. Together with producer Julie Zackary and directors Nick Bruno and Troy Quane (“Spies in Disguise”) — who replaced original director Patrick Osborne (the Oscar-winning “Feast” short at Disney) — they quickly got Annapurna’s Megan Ellison on board, who was already a fan. Soon after, they formed Annapurna Animation and secured Netflix and London-based DNEG, where it was animated from scratch to fit their pipeline.The directing duo went back to Stevenson’s graphic novel for inspiration in telling the story of Nimona teaming up with Ballister, Ahmed’s falsely accused knight on the run, which takes a dark turn when she’s hunted down as a monster.“After wrapping ‘Spies in Disguise,’ we were asked to come in and just help with the story a bit,” Quane told IndieWire. “So it was March 2020 that Nick and I stepped into the director’s seat and the pandemic hit five days later. We all went home and kept making the movie. While everyone figured out how to overcome the technical hurdles and everything else, what we couldn’t overcome were the financial realities of Disney needing to shut down Blue Sky.”Bruno added that all of these obstacles would’ve sunk the film if it were not for the compelling source material. “It’s a story about acceptance, about feeling misunderstood, and a kingdom not loving who you are,” he told IndieWire. “But I feel like everyone was so connected to those themes that they kept fighting for it, and that’s why it’s here.”Yet “Nimona” was technically daunting. The handmade, simplified look was a cross between the mid-century illustrative styles of background artist Eyvind Earle (Disney’s elegant “Sleeping Beauty”) and minimalist wildlife artist Charley Harper. But they turned the world-building into a combination of medieval and modern that mirrored the world we live in.“The reason why we had to pick two was Eyvind Earle had a lot more of the fluid organic language and Charley Harper was using a lot of similar conventions, but in a more geometric and simple shape base,” production designer Aidan Sugano told IndieWire. “And pretty quickly we realized that we needed that range to convey both sides of the spectrum and both sides of the character ideologies. Luckily, both [artists] were contemporaries and played in the same universe.”But then they also had the shape language of the graphic novel to incorporate as well. This included circles for the free-form Nimona, squares for the traditionalist Ballister, and diamonds for the rigid Institute where the knights are trained. In the case of the pink-colored Nimona, her shape-shifting (rhino, whale, cat, gorilla) translated into an explosion of emotions.“They took the shapeshift concept and pushed it to its limit,” added Sugano, “which is how we kind of got to this moment where Nimona is in such pain and turmoil.”In terms of the animation, it was the most complex film ever attempted at Blue Sky. Fortunately, the studio’s experience on “The Peanuts Movie” proved invaluable for further 2D stylization. “That introduced some of those mixed 2D elements into the 3D universe,” Sugano said. “It’s almost like trying to strip the 3D-ness out of 3D. To go at the core, simple color shapes that are there, and then put back just enough information.”Yet to translate the hand of the artist in the animation required a new approach at Blue Sky. “They had to break everything because the tech doesn’t give us that,” the production designer added. “It was very much a balancing act of pulling back and putting back. And you’re doing extremes with lighting: blown out versus stark shadows. The biggest challenge for this entire production was finding those solutions in that collaborative mindset to make sure that we kept as consistent as possible.”However, it all had to be handed over to DNEG in a form of animated shapeshifting. Fortunately, the studio was no stranger to 2D stylization with Netflix’s adult animated musical series, “Entergalactic,” created by Kid Cudi.“Unfortunately, we had to restart from square one, rebuilding different pipelines, different technologies,” Bruno said. “But Blue Sky gave a blueprint for what we were looking for, and all of that R&D that went into it, they were able to translate it and apply it with their tech. And we found the right team in DNEG to mind meld and get it into place.”",

        "content": "Scarlett Johansson couldn’t get her audition for Alfonso Cuarón‘s “Gravity” off the ground.The “Under the Skin” star told Entertainment Tonight about doing a screen test for Cuarón’s Oscar-winning 2013 film that eventually starred Sandra Bullock as an astronaut whose space shuttle is destroyed.Johansson revealed that she has “done a lot of weird screen tests” and cited “Gravity” as one of them.“I did a screen test for the movie ‘Gravity,’ that Sandra Bullock is fantastic in, but I had to be in, like, the full whole space suit thing, and sort of pretend I was kind of like floating in space,” Johansson said, “even though I was just sitting in a chair with a helmet on.”The “Asteroid City” actress recently told Variety that she felt “hopeless” after losing out on “Gravity” amid a slew of “unfulfilling” roles.“I got turned down for two roles — the first was ‘Iron Man 2’ and then the other one was Alfonso Cuarón’s ‘Gravity,'” Johansson said. “I had wanted that role so much. It was sort of the straw that broke the camel’s back. I felt really frustrated and hopeless. Like, ‘Am I doing the right job?'”She continued, “The work I was being offered felt deeply unfulfilling. I think I was offered every Marilyn Monroe script ever. I was like, ‘Is this the end of the road creatively?'”The star admitted it was “hard to get out of that pigeonhole” of playing an onscreen bombshell. “And I did films like ‘He’s Just Not That Into You’ and movies that kind of continued that narrative,” Johansson said. “I couldn’t make any headway.”Spike Jonze’s “Her” helped “reignite” Johansson’s “passion” for acting. “Suddenly it was like, ‘I still love this job,’” she said. “I felt less anxious.”Johansson started her career with breakout roles in “Lost in Translation” and “Girl With the Pearl Earring” around age 19.“I was coming into my own womanhood and learning my own desirability and sexuality,” Johansson said. “I was kind of being groomed, in a way, to be this what you call a bombshell-type actor. I was playing the other woman and the object of desire and I suddenly found myself cornered in this place. I couldn’t get out of it.”She continued, “It would be easy to sit across from someone in that situation and go, ‘This is working.’ But for that kind of bombshell, you know, that burns bright and quick and then it’s done and you don’t have opportunity beyond that. It was an interesting, weird conundrum to be in but it really came back to working at it and trying to carve a place in different projects and work in great ensembles.”At the premiere of “Asteroid City” in New York on Tuesday evening, director Wes Anderson praised Johansson as a “great movie star playing a good one,” referring to her character Midge Campbell, a middling actress stranded in a California desert town during a quarantine.",

        "title": "Could the Best Training to Direct Movies Be Stunt Coordination?",
        "content": "When Netflix‘s “Extraction” premiered in 2020, its elaborately constructed set pieces propelled it to become the streaming service’s most-watched original film to that point and marked director Sam Hargrave as a talent to watch. Hargrave and star Chris Hemsworth now return to the adventures of Australian black ops mercenary Tyler Rake (Hemsworth) for “Extraction 2,” a sequel that improves upon its predecessor in just about every way without losing sight of what audiences loved about the first movie. The action is bigger, the motivations more personal and affecting, and Hargrave’s command of his craft more assured.Hargrave is part of one of the most positive trends in action filmmaking in recent years: The rise of directors with a background in stunts. The most famous examples are Chad Stahelski (the “John Wick” franchise) and David Leitch (“Atomic Blonde,” “Bullet Train“), who follow in the footsteps of ’70s and ’80s pioneers Hal Needham (“Smokey and the Bandit”) and Craig Baxley (“Action Jackson”) on the trajectory from stuntman to stunt coordinator to second unit directing and directing. And the trend is not limited to theatrical filmmaking: over in television, terrific work is being done — and on lower budgets and tighter schedules — by directors like Steve Boyum, who performed stunts on “Apocalypse Now” and is currently directing FX’s “The Old Man,” and David Barrett, who continues to moonlight as a stuntman (most recently on “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts”) even though he’s an in-demand director of episodic action series like “FBI: International” and “True Lies.”These directors exhibit an unerring eye for blocking and choreography and are experts at placing their cameras in the most felicitous positions to capture as much visceral impact as possible. But they are also as attentive to the connective tissue between the action scenes — the performances and the quieter moments that give the action its meaning. This is certainly true of Hargrave’s work on “Extraction 2”; while the film is loaded with spectacular action — including an over-20-minute prison break that plays out in one unbroken shot — it’s also got a surprising degree of poignancy and longing, expressed by Hemsworth in one of the best performances of his career.According to Hargrave, who was Chris Evans’ stunt double on the “Captain America” movies, his history in stunts informed both aspects of “Extraction 2.” Referring to Stahelski, Leitch, Boyum, and Barrett, Hargrave told IndieWire’s Filmmaker Toolkit podcast that “had they not been in the stunt world, they probably would have ended up being directors. There’s just a certain sensibility that lends itself to that skill set. They’re working with actors very closely during the rehearsal process, and I did a lot of that as well. So you’re communicating with actors and understanding how they think, how they operate. That on-the-job experience gives you a leg up on many directors coming out of film school. They may have the technical acumen to know where to put the camera and the lights, but in the stunt world, you’re communicating with actors on a daily basis.”Hargrave feels that working as a stunt double for a high-level performer provides insight not only into what actors need but essential training in conveying a point of view to the crew. “As a fight choreographer, you have communication skills because you’re working with other department heads,” he said. Having 10 years of experience being on set, seeing where they put the cameras, communicating with people, understanding budgets and how long things take, and understanding the ins and outs of the filmmaking process from the standpoint of a crew member is invaluable when it comes to directing.”For Hargrave, there were lessons to be learned both from the directors he felt were great at managing the crew — Francis Lawrence, the Russo brothers, Gavin O’Connor — and those who weren’t so great. “I’m not going to name names, but there are people who don’t communicate as well or understand the process, and you go, ‘Ah, it’s much easier to work with this person who understands what’s happening.'”Working in stunts also gave Hargrave one of the most vital and undervalued virtues a director can have: patience. “I’ve had to sit with special effects [and deal with them] from a safety standpoint as a stunt coordinator and second unit director,” Hargrave said. “I know how long it takes to reset a car flip. So I’m not, as a director, pulling my hair out, going, ‘What’s taking so long?’ I know it’s taking so long because certain things have to happen. Same with costumes. ‘Why do we have to do this?’ Well, because they forgot to put a gusset in the jeans and we split the pants and now it’s gonna take them a second. And you’re a little more empathetic because you’ve been there on the crew side. That’s kind of a long-winded way of saying that I think those who have been in the stunt world have on-the-job experience for many, many years working with departments and with actors and that translates very well to being a director and communicating with your crew.”",

        "title": "Quentin Tarantino Has a ‘Big Thing’ Against Killing Animals in His Movies: ‘A Bridge I Can’t Cross’",
        "content": "Quentin Tarantino has a line he will not cross when it comes to violence onscreen.The “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” auteur explained during a Cannes Film Festival event that he would never “kill” an animal in one of his films, citing the “incompetence” of showing cruelty toward animals in cinema. (Via Variety.)“I have a big thing about killing animals in movies. That’s a bridge I can’t cross,” Tarantino said. “Insects too. Unless I’m paying to see some bizarro documentary, I’m not paying to see real death. Part of the way that this all works is that it’s all just make-believe.”He continued, “That’s why I can stand the violent scenes, because we’re all just fucking around. [But] some animal, some dog, some llama, some fly, some rat, doesn’t give a fuck about your movie. I’d kill a million rats, but I don’t necessarily want to kill one in a movie or see one killed in a movie, because I’m not paying to see real death.”The “Kill Bill” director added, “Almost always, it’s not just the violence that I have a problem with. There’s usually an incompetence factor in there.”Tarantino is instead totally fine using violence onscreen to correct the wrongs of history. For “Inglourious Basterds,” Tarantino said, “I wrote myself into a corner and said, ‘Now what do I do?’ Then all of a sudden, the thought just came to me, ‘Just fucking kill him. Wait, can I do that? Well yeah, it’s my story.’ But in the case of ‘Once Upon a Time,’ I wrote that to save Sharon and kill those motherfuckers.”The writer-director concluded, “Kurosawa would do this a lot. He would write himself into a corner and tell his writers to get him out.”Tarantino recently gave more details on his final film “The Movie Critic,” which will center around a “porno rag journalist” who published film reviews.“I haven’t decided yet but it’s going to be somebody in the 35-year-old ballpark. It’ll definitely be a new leading man for me,” Tarantino said. “I do have an idea of somebody I can imagine doing it really well…”As for capping off his movie career, Tarantino, who has long said he will stop at 10 feature films, added, “It’s just time to go out. I like the idea of going out on top. I like the idea of giving it my all for 30 years and then saying, ‘OK, that’s enough.’ And I don’t like working to diminishing returns. And I mean, now is a good time because I mean, what even is a motion picture anyway anymore? Is it just something that they show on Apple? That would be diminishing returns.”",

        "title": "‘Kokomo City’ Trailer: A Raucous Real Talk Documentary Led by Black Trans Women",
        "content": "When critics write about authentic storytelling, they are talking about films like “Kokomo City.” Shot, edited, produced, and directed by visionary new voice D. Smith, this artful and spirited documentary is a rare unvarnished portrait of four lively and charming Black trans women. Shot in black and white from a friendly and intimate perspective, the women candidly share their musings on sex work, community, and dating as a trans woman.The refreshing film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, where it nabbed a few awards and rave reviews — including an IndieWire Critics’ Pick. Magnolia Pictures will release the film in select theaters on July 28, where it’s sure to surprise and delight audiences thirsty for original material. IndieWire is proud to debut the trailer exclusively.Per distributor Magnolia, “Kokomo City” is the feature directorial debut of two-time Grammy-nominated producer, singer and songwriter D. Smith. Smith also filmed and edited this wildly entertaining and refreshingly unfiltered documentary that passes the mic to four Black transgender sex workers in Atlanta and New York City — Daniella Carter, Koko Da Doll, Liyah Mitchell and Dominique Silver — as they hold nothing back while breaking down the walls of their profession. Executive produced by Lena Waithe, the film won the Sundance Film Festival NEXT Innovator Award and the NEXT Audience Award, as well as the Berlinale’s Audience Award in the Panorama Documentary section.A successful musician and songwriter, filmmaker D. Smith makes a confident pivot to filmmaking in an impressive act of vulnerability. As a trans woman, she is able to approach her subjects from the equal footing of shared experience, using her camera as a vessel for them to speak their truth. Throughout the film, the women engage in the kind of vulnerable and honest conversations that usually only occur behind closed doors. In drawing back the curtain on her community, Smith invites the viewer to fully immerse themselves and empathize with the experience of being a Black trans woman in America.While the women of “Kokomo City” are often hilarious and refreshing, their stories are also filled with heartbreak, racism, transphobia, and violence. The film experienced a tragic loss earlier this year when one of the film’s subjects, Rasheeda Williams, also known as Koko Da Doll, was murdered in Atlanta.“I created ‘Kokomo City’ because I wanted to show the fun, humanized, natural side of Black trans women,” Smith said in a statement at the time. “I wanted to create images that didn’t show the trauma or the statistics of murder of Transgender lives. I wanted to create something fresh and inspiring. I did that. We did that! But here we are again.”Magnolia Pictures will release “Kokomo City” in theaters on July 28, 2023.",

        "content": "Chloë Grace Moretz is ready to save Riz Ahmed in animated form.The two actors lead the long-awaited queer graphic novel adaptation “Nimona,” now being released by Netflix after previously being scrapped by Walt Disney Co. after the company allegedly took issue with the now-defunct Blue Sky Studios’ inclusion of a same-sex kiss.The official synopsis for “Nimona” reads: When Ballister Boldheart (Ahmed), a knight in a futuristic medieval world, is framed for a crime he didn’t commit, the only one who can help him prove his innocence is Nimona (Moretz), a mischievous teen with a taste for mayhem — who also happens to be a shapeshifting creature Ballister has been trained to destroy. But with the entire kingdom out to get him, Nimona’s the best (or technically the only) sidekick Ballister can hope for. And as the lines between heroes, villains, and monsters start to blur, the two of them set out to wreak serious havoc — for Ballister to clear his name once and for all, and for Nimona to…just wreak serious havoc.   Eugene Lee Yang, Frances Conroy, Lorraine Toussaint, Beck Bennett, Indya Moore, RuPaul Charles, Julio Torres, and Sarah Sherman also star.“Nimona” is based on ND Stevenson’s bestselling 2015 graphic novel. The film is directed by Nick Bruno and Troy Quane. The script is co-written by Robert L. Baird and Lloyd Taylor. Karen Ryan, Julie Zackary, and Roy Lee serve as producers, with Megan Ellison, Robert L. Baird, Andrew Millstein, and John Powers Middleton as executive producers. Author Stevenson is a co-producer.Before Netflix acquired the film in partnership with Annapurna Pictures, Blue Sky Studios executives claimed that “Nimona” was “75 percent” completed before Disney allegedly had “pushback” on the LGBTQ+ themes central to the story. “Nimona” started production again early last year with DNEG Animation.Author Stevenson celebrated Netflix distributing the film, tweeting, “‘Nimona’’s always been a spunky little story that just wouldn’t stop. She’s a fighter…but she’s also got some really awesome people fighting for her. I am excited out of my mind to announce that THE NIMONA MOVIE IS ALIVE…coming at you in 2023 from Annapurna and Netflix.”“Nimona” premieres June 30 on Netflix. Check out the trailer below.",

        "content": "“Joker: Folie à Deux” promises to be a bigger, crazier, and much more musical addition to the “Joker” universe — but Lady Gaga did her best to stay grounded while transforming into the unhinged psychiatrist Harley Quinn. Her co-star Zazie Beetz has nothing but good things to say about Gaga’s performance in Todd Phillips’ follow-up to his Oscar-winning 2019 film.“She’s super warm and kind,” Beetz told Variety of Gaga, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta. “I felt very welcome with her on set. She was doing her own character work and stuff, but she’s a very grounded person. She’s just Stefani.”Beetz teased that fans will be “surprised” at how the musical sequel unfolds.“I don’t think it’s going to be what they expect, around it being musical,” the “Atlanta” actress said. “We all sort of express musically and dancing in our lives day-to-day. I think it’s going to work really well.”“Joker: Folie à Deux” sees Joaquin Phoenix reprising his Oscar-winning role as tortured loner-turned-supervillain Arthur Fleck. Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener, Jacob Lofland, and Harry Lawtey round out the cast. The film is rumored to primarily take place in Arkham Asylum, the famous psychiatric institute that houses villains in the “Batman” comic books. The film is set for an October 4, 2024 release.Lady Gaga’s dramatic acting chops are unimpeachable at this point, and she’s had several opportunities to fine-tune her process. The Academy Award winner previously stayed in character for her roles in “A Star Is Born” and “House of Gucci.”“I would actually say playing a character for me is like living one long song, one long song that lasts for months,” Gaga said in 2022. “For ‘A Star Is Born,’ it was years for me. When I’m in character, I don’t pretend we’re not filming. I get people who are like, ‘Why did you keep your accent the whole time?’ Can you imagine going in and out of that shit all the time, and I would only get three takes?

In the case of Tom Cruise, he called us, talked for 15 minutes, praising Andy, praising the film, and it just feels very good because we really work very hard to make these movies.”Sources told The Hollywood Reporter in March 2023 that Cruise allegedly had seen the film in late February following a meeting with Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav.Andy Muschietti also revealed that he contacted “Justice League” director Zack Snyder to assure “The Flash” would be “respectful” to the DC cinematic universe Snyder built.“I talked to Zack, but it wasn’t technical or narrative or anything. I just wanted to reach out and say, ‘Hey,'” he said. “Because we haven’t met before, and I just wanted to tell him that we would be respectful to the stuff that he did before.”Muschietti continued, “‘Man of Steel’ obviously is foundational to this movie because the big threat of Zod [Michael Shannon] coming to Earth is a big twist in this story, and it’s something that most DC fans know very well. And that’s one of the great things that can form the narrative of this movie.”Lead star Miller recently thanked Snyder onstage at “The Flash” premiere, as well as DC Studios co-heads Peter Safran and James Gunn for their “grace and discernment” amid Miller’s mental health crises, multiple arrests, and allegations of assault and grooming.",

        "content": "Tom Hanks was not in the rom-com mood when Nora Ephron called him about “When Harry Met Sally.”Hanks, who went on to collaborate with Ephron and Meg Ryan on beloved genre classics “You’ve Got Mail” and “Sleepless in Seattle,” apparently could not relate to the idea of Harry (who was eventually played by Billy Crystal) being depressed after his divorce.“People probably don’t know this, but Tom was offered when ‘Harry Met Sally’ and he turned it down because he was going through a divorce and he was very happy to be not married,” Hanks’ current wife and fellow filmmaker Rita Wilson said during an appearance on iHeartPodcast’s “Table for Two With Bruce Bozzi.”She continued, “And so he could not understand that a person going through a divorce would have anything other than just like, ‘I’m so happy.’ But I loved that script.”Hanks had divorced his first wife Samantha Lewes in 1987. The couple had been married since 1978, when Hanks was 21 years old. Hanks and Wilson met on set of “Volunteers” and tied the knot in 1988. Lewes died of bone cancer in 2002.Albert Brooks, Michael Keaton, Harrison Ford, Bill Murray, and Richard Dreyfuss were allegedly also approached for the part. Billy Crystal eventually landed the iconic role, though director Rob Reiner was concerned that working with his close friend could “destroy” their personal relationship.“It turned out way better than anything I could have imagined because not only was he great in the part, it made our friendship better,” Reiner told Variety in 2019 for the film‘s 30th anniversary.Ephron shared that she penned the script with Reiner in mind as Harry as they both were going through respective divorces at the time. Ephron separated from second husband Carl Bernstein in 1979, and Reiner split with Penny Marshall in 1981.Reiner pushed to change the ending of “When Harry Met Sally” after meeting his future wife Michele Singer in the process of making the film. The last scene was originally supposed to be Harry (Crystal) and Sally (Ryan) walking away from each other for good.“Because at that time, I couldn’t figure out how I was going to get with anybody, so I just had them walking in opposite directions at the end,” Reiner told The A.V. Club. “And then I met the woman who became my wife during the making of the movie, and I changed the ending. I loved making the movie, I loved the experience.”",

        "title": "‘No Country for Old Men’ Author Cormac McCarthy Dead at 89",
        "content": "Cormac McCarthy, the literary giant whose violently nihilistic visions of America influenced a generation of writers and filmmakers, has died at the age of 89. His death was confirmed by publisher Knopf. McCarthy passed away at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The news was first reported by Publishers Weekly.Born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1933, McCarthy published his first novel, “The Orchard Keeper,” in 1965. He slowly rose to prominence in the literary world and eventually became known as one of the most important American authors of the 20th century for novels such as “Blood Meridian” and “The Road.”In 2005 he published “No Country for Old Men,” which Joel and Ethan Coen adapted into a 2007 film that elevated their status as dramatic filmmakers and cemented McCarthy’s Hollywood legacy. Cinematographer Roger Deakins recently reflected on the making of the film, recalling that “Joel said we’re doing this script, ’No Country for Old Men.’ I had just read the book, so I said ‘Aren’t you gonna direct?’ And he said, ‘Well, we might.’ I said ‘I’ll never talk to you again if you don’t direct it.'”The neo-Western thriller starring Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, and Tommy Lee Jones won Best Picture at the Academy Awards, as well as Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor for Bardem.While best known for his novels, McCarthy also dabbled in screenwriting when he penned the script for Ridley Scott’s 2013 drug thriller “The Counselor.” The film, which starred Michael Fassbender, Javier Bardem, Cameron Diaz, and Brad Pitt, polarized audiences upon its initial release but has since picked up a passionate cult following.McCarthy remained active up until his death, publishing two novels — “The Passenger” and “Stella Maris” — in 2022. His works continue to inspire filmmakers — New Regency announced a film adaptation of his novel “Blood Meridian” from director John Hillcoat in April. Like many of McCarthy’s iconic works, “Blood Meridian” is set on the Texas-Mexico border and touches on themes of manifest destiny and the dark underground of race-driven crimes. Hillcoat previously helmed the adaptation of McCarthy’s “The Road.”",

        "content": "It seems like Sarah Polley is ready to focus on Disney animals talking.The “Women Talking” writer-director is currently in early talks to helm the live-action adaptation of Disney’s “Bambi,” IndieWire has confirmed. Polley won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for her 2022 feminist film “Women Talking.” The news was first reported by Deadline.Disney first announced a live-action “Bambi” adaptation in 2020, with Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Lindsey Beer set to write the script. Depth of Field production company was attached to produce. As of now it is unclear if all parties are still behind the project, which is still in the early stages of development.“Bambi” was the fifth animated feature film to ever be released by Disney. The 1942 movie was an adaptation of Felix Salten’s novel about a young, motherless deer who befriends fellow woodland creatures. Disney’s “Bambi” earned Oscar nominations for Best Sound, Best Song, and Best Original Music Score. The film was entered into the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 2011.Disney’s push for live-action adaptations of beloved animated classics most recently led to the Halle Bailey-fronted “Little Mermaid,” directed by Rob Marshall. Esteemed filmmakers such as Jon Favreau, Kenneth Branagh, Niki Caro, Guy Ritchie, Tim Burton, and Robert Zemeckis have all directed live-action Disney remakes.“Take This Waltz” director Polley previously told IndieWire that after over a decade away from Hollywood, she became inspired to adapt Miriam Toews’ “Women Talking” upon reading the novel in a book club.“I was not looking for another film to direct,” Polley said. “I love writing and spending time with my three little kids. The idea of working really long hours on a film set was not something I was interested in…Every film to me has maybe been my last. But I loved this experience and I’m appreciative of it in a way that I haven’t been before. I can see making a film again in less than 10 years. I never had a sense of what my next movie would be. It was always about having something essential to say. The intention is always a conversation I would like to start for people to have.”",

        "title": "‘Fast X’ Gets Expedited Early PVOD Release and Easily Wins the Race",
        "content": "Universal executives last week made a statement about how lucrative early PVOD availability has been for the studio (over $1 billion in retail revenue, most returned to them). Then on Friday, they made a statement suggesting how accepted the practice has become.“Fast X,” with an investment approaching $500 million in production and marketing costs, became available on domestic platforms for $19.99 rental ($24.99 purchase). That was 22 days after it debuted in theaters, and grossed $67 million its opening weekend.Hold on there — wasn’t the oft-repeated understanding that any Universal film that opened over $50 million had at least a 31 day window? This was widely reported when the studio came to an understanding with major exhibitors in 2020 (which included the latter having some participation in the revenue).That has consistently been the minimum case over the past three years. And recently “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” an even bigger grossing film, had a 41 day window, 10 days longer than normal.Neither Universal nor exhibition sources would comment on this. But the lack of any protest suggests that the studio had convinced theaters that this move would have little impact on the remaining play of “Fast X.” It fell 46 percent this weekend, about the expected range, for #6 and $5.2 million.With a disappointing (versus cost) $653 million worldwide take, close to what it will finish with, the film needs additional revenue badly. This is the easiest way to get it.There is no indication that the longer “SMB” window and this have any relationship. But it does suggest that both Universal and top theaters accept common sense flexibility. That’s healthy for all parties.“Are You There, God? It’s Me Margaret” (Lionsgate) held off until after six weekends. It was rewarded with a mediocre showing, making only two charts (#7 on Vudu, #10 on iTunes). Compare that to how “Nefarious” (Soli Deo), also $19.99 is doing. The latter, a small faith-based horror film, grossed $5 million in theaters and got little mainstream media attention. The July Blume adaptation received strong reviews and significant coverage, with a lackluster $20 million gross. The added PVOD attention will add some revenue to defray from the cost (production and advertising combined perhaps $20 million), but it doesn’t appear to be nearly enough.“SMB” was #2 at Vudu, iTunes, and Google Play, with “John Wick: Chapter 4” (Lionsgate) either #3 or 4. “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” (Sony) was #3 at iTunes, #4 at Google Play (its $3.99 rental price hurts it at revenue-counting Vudu). “The Pope’s Exorcist” (Sony), with a reduced $5.99 price, also made all three charts.The best non-horror independent performance again came from “BlackBerry” (IFC), which came out after three weekends. It currently #6 on iTunes.Netflix is different this weekend. Not so much the entries on the chart (primarily the same as last week, reordered — the animated “Boss Baby” is #1), but because there isn’t a single of their original films listed. On average, most weeks have at least three, often topping the chart. Often they are international and even non-English original languages.But not this week. Part of this seems to be lack of anything new of note (itself unusual — a sign of production cutbacks, or delaying some titles anticipating a future lag because of the WGA strike?). That will change when “Extraction 2” debuts this Friday. The sequel to their graphic comic Chris Hemsworth-starring action film, which had about 100 million views its first month, should be an easy #1 initially.The biggest change was that Best Actress nominated “To Leslie,” which briefly hit #1, quickly fell of the chart in its second week.iTunes and Google Play rank films daily by number of transactions.

        "content": "The team behind “Coco” has a new coming-of-age tearjerker in the works for Pixar. “Elio,” the 28th animated feature from the legendary studio, is directed by Adrian Molina who wrote and co-helmed 2018 Oscar-winning film.“Elio” is centered around the titular 11-year-old underdog (voiced by Yonas Kibreab), who has an active imagination and is beamed up to the Communiverse, an interplanetary organization with representatives from various galaxies. The official synopsis reads: Mistakenly identified as Earth’s ambassador to the rest of the universe, and completely unprepared for that kind of pressure, Elio must form new bonds with eccentric alien lifeforms, survive a series of formidable trials and somehow discover who he is truly meant to be. America Ferrera voices Elio’s mother Olga, with Jameela Jamil and Brad Garrett cast as intergalactic ambassadors.In addition to Molina, “Coco” associate producer Mary Alice Drumm also produces “Elio.”“Elio” joins the slew of upcoming Disney/Pixar projects, including “Inside Out 2” and “Elemental,” which premiered at Cannes. Siddhant Adlakha’s IndieWire review praised the “stunning images and thoughtful aesthetics” behind the feature with themes of the American Dream and immigrant experience.“‘Elemental’ has enough charming moments to get by, even if its meaning lies less in its ill-conceived immigrant saga, and more in the personal drama that lives a few layers beneath it,” the review reads.Pixar’s first original long-form animated television series also debuts on Disney+ in 2024. Titled “Win or Lose,” the series hails from longtime Pixar executives Carrie Hobson and Michael Yates and tells the story of a week in the life of a middle school softball team called the Pickles as they prepare for their championship game. Each of the episodes will tell the same story from the perspective of different characters, with different animation styles utilized depending on the character POV.“Win or Lose” isn’t the only high profile animated series that’s hitting Disney+ soon. “Zootopia+” is set to continue the 2016 film‘s storyline with six one-off episodes, with one featuring Martin Scorsese as a rodent in “The Godfather of the Bride.”“Elio” premieres in theaters on March 1, 2024.

        "title": "Meryl Streep Was ‘Miserable’ Method Acting in ‘The Devil Wears Prada,’ Says Emily Blunt",
        "content": "Meryl Streep literally transformed into Miranda Priestley for “The Devil Wears Prada.”Streep’s co-star Emily Blunt, whose quippy comedic turn in the film marked her breakout role, revealed that Streep was “miserable” staying in character for the beloved 2006 film during a conversation with Brian Cox for Variety’s Actors on Actors. Streep starred as an Anna Wintour-inspired fashion magazine editor who constantly abuses her employees in her quest for perfection.“She’s amazing and was slightly terrifying on that film,” Blunt said of Streep. “She said it was one of the first times she’s tried Method acting. But it made her so miserable, playing Miranda.”Oscar winner Streep previously admitted that it was “horrible” to isolate herself from her co-stars on set while in character as Miranda.“I was [miserable] in my trailer,” Streep recalled in 2021. “I could hear them all rocking and laughing. I was so depressed! I said, ‘Well, it’s the price you pay for being boss!’ That’s the last time I ever attempted a Method thing.”Blunt added at the time, “Meryl is so gregarious and fun as hell, in some ways it wasn’t the most fun for her having to remove herself. It wasn’t like she was unapproachable; you could go up to her and say, ‘Oh my God, the funniest thing just happened,’ and she’d listen, but I don’t know if it was the most fun for her to be on set being that way.”Hathaway noted that Streep never made her feel “intimidated” while Method acting, saying, “I knew that whatever she was doing to create that fear, I appreciated [because] I also knew she was watching out for me.”Director David Frankel told IndieWire during the film’s decade anniversary in 2016 that Streep’s character was actually meant to be the “heroine” of the story, and not Hathaway’s Andy Sachs.“I was a fan of Anna Wintour and Vogue magazine. For me the approach to developing the movie properly was to make Miranda Priestley the heroine, someone to be celebrated sympathetically rather than someone to be reviled,” Frankel said. “In my view of the world, we should be thrilled to have the people who are excellent at what they do, superior at their jobs. The fact that they are not always nice is irrelevant.”",

        "title": "‘Chasing Chasing Amy’ Review: A Nuanced Ode to a Problematic Queer Fave",
        "content": "We all have our problematic faves. Especially if you’ve been watching movies for longer than, say, yesterday. The #MeToo reckoning didn’t just reveal the monsters in Hollywood’s closet, it also made it impossible to ignore the pervasive sexism, misogyny, and power imbalances permeating every aspect of the industry. So pervasive, in fact, that very few projects weren’t touched by the stench. In the case of Kevin Smith, his career is directly tied to Harvey Weinstein’s Miramax, which produced and distributed four of his early films, including one of his biggest hits, “Chasing Amy.”Released in 1997, “Chasing Amy” followed on the heels of Smith’s debut hit “Clerks” and the sophomoric flop “Mallrats.” The film stars Joey Lauren Adams as an effortlessly cool lesbian and Ben Affleck as the persistent straight man who falls in love with (and eventually seduces) her. Funny, romantic, and a total straight man’s fantasy, “Chasing Amy” reinforced the idea that every lesbian was just waiting for a man to turn her on to dick. Told completely from a straight man’s point of view, the movie conveniently ignores the obvious existence of bisexuality, even while enshrining an iconic bisexual character.For filmmaker Sav Rodgers, who grew up in Kansas in the late ’90s, “Chasing Amy” was an obsession and a lifeline. His reverential documentary “Chasing Chasing Amy” reckons with the queer legacy of “Chasing Amy” — warts and all. Grounded in Rodgers’ ardent fandom, “Chasing Chasing Amy” is a messy love letter to a film that had otherwise been quietly tucked away in the archives of queer film history. Sure, the middle-aged Smith fans running comic stores in New Jersey would always remember it fondly, but what about the queer kids who discovered something about themselves in Amy’s leather jacket and raspy-voiced bravado? What are we supposed to do with our very different experiences of the sexy — but deeply misguided — slacker comedy?At the time, mainstream movies about lesbians were exceedingly rare, though not entirely absent from the indie film circles Smith ran in (more on that later). It make sense that the film would make such an impression on Rodgers as a closeted young kid. As a queer adult, however, he understands the movie’s flaws and gives sufficient air to them in the documentary. They are numerously and humorously recounted by “Go Fish” writer Guinevere Turner (always a great interview), who both stars in “Chasing Amy” and inspired the screenplay. Turner met Smith at Sundance in 1994, the pivotal year that “Go Fish” and “Clerks” debuted. Both films were shot in black-and-white; both were made on shoestring budgets; and both were conversational, character-driven comedies. One was about lesbians, the other was about straight men. And only one of those filmmakers got a mainstream career. Guess which one?“Kevin got an empire, and we were just some dykes,” says Turner, who has made her peace with the “lovely and heartfelt” film after many years of “dyke rage.” For his part, Smith is deferential to Turner’s influence on him at the time, openly admitting that the story for “Chasing Amy” was inspired by Turner’s romantic friendship with his longtime producer Scott Mosier. Such frankly spirited interviews from movers and shakers of the ’90s indie scene are a highlight of “Chasing Chasing Amy,” but they’re not the sole focus of the movie.As the title suggests, “Chasing Chasing Amy” is also about Rodgers’ own process of coming out — first as queer and then trans — and how “Chasing Amy” fits into his personal narrative. The documentary starts with a 2019 TED Talk titled “How Chasing Amy Saved My Life,” including a cheesy visual of the video racking up views and comments rolling in. His fandom is palpable throughout, and it’s heartening to see Smith and Rodgers geek out in their interviews. Smith is visibly moved by Rodgers’ positive experience with “Chasing Amy,” saying, “You gave me my movie back.”The movie drags when it loses sight of this magic, like when Rodgers visits various New Jersey locations where the film was shot or the extended focus on his sweet but totally normal relationship. The personal elements of queer discovery are obviously meant to balance out the thornier parts of the real story — the one about a movie that was meaningful but deeply flawed. That’s a weak point in Rodgers’ fandom: For all his “Chasing Amy” obsession, he doesn’t love the movie quite enough to let it speak for itself.One person with plenty to say is Joey Lauren Adams, whose big solo interview is surprisingly moving, candid, and infuriating all at once. Adams was dating Smith at the time of “Chasing Amy,” and the character is infused with a lot of her quirks, not to mention the actual relationship issues Smith worked out through Affleck’s character. Though she’s heartened by the movie’s queer fans, her experience was very different. “I don’t love looking back at that time,” she says, recalling the discomfort she felt around Weinstein. “We all knew who he was.”Adams’ career never really took off after her It Girl season, when she got a Golden Globe nomination for “Chasing Amy” and endured questions about her sexuality while doing the late-night rounds. Like Turner, she has continued to find work in Hollywood, but she is still mostly known as a supporting player in the Kevin Smith kingdom.Rodgers doesn’t seem to know what to do with these uncomfortable truths, though he knows enough to give the interview a prime slot. He never presses Smith about his relationship with Weinstein or follows up about any of Adams’ or Turner’s reflections. There’s more than just ’90s-era bi-erasure going on in “Chasing Amy”: The film turned out to be a fascinating microcosm of the continued effects of Hollywood sexism. In Turner’s wit and Adams’ pain, we get a glimpse of the brilliant women who were sidelined in favor of childish men in this one tiny corner of Hollywood. All the pieces are there in “Chasing Chasing Amy,” but it all proved a bit unwieldy for what is essentially a Kevin Smith fan film, albeit a charming one.Grade: B“Chasing Chasing Amy” premiered at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival. It is currently seeking distribution.",

The studio has, however, slotted in release dates for two new “Star Wars” films.“Captain America: Brave New World,” “Thunderbolts,” “Blade,” “Fantastic Four,” the next “Avengers” movies and “Avatar 3″ have all been pushed back. “Brave New World” and “Thunderbolts” were bumped into late 2024, and “Blade” and “Fantastic Four” have moved to later in 2025. James Cameron’s “Avatar 3” has moved from December 2024 to December 2025. The fifth and final “Avatar” movie now won’t hit theaters until 2031. The untitled third “Deadpool” movie is one of the rare Marvel movies actually moving up on the release calendar. It will now open May 3, 2024, up from a prior release in November.Several of these movies have been impacted as a result of the Writers Guild of America strike, with “Blade” among those that have been halted indefinitely until the strike is completed.Other movies shifted on the calendar include the live-action “Moana,” which will now open June 27, 2025, up slightly from July 2, 2025. The two untitled, unspecified “Star Wars” movies will each open in 2026, one in late May and the other in December. Fede Alvarez’s upcoming “Alien” movie will now open on August 6, 2024.While it’s unclear what the “Star Wars” movies are, Lucasfilm previously announced the upcoming theatrical titles on its slate back at this year’s Star Wars Celebration event, including movies directed by James Mangold and long-time “Star Wars” TV guru Dave Filoni. There’s alsoOscar-winning filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy’s previously announced feature, which will see the return of Daisy Ridley to the franchise as her character Rey.The current phase of the MCU now won’t conclude until May 7, 2027, which is the new release date of “Avengers: Secret Wars.” It will be separated by a year from “Avengers: Kang Dynasty,” which hits theaters in 2026. The studio is also still grappling with what to do with star Jonathan Majors as Kang following the actor’s arrest earlier this year.And the “Avatar” franchise, once meant to wrap up by 2028, now won’t be finished until 2031. The third film has been largely shot, and Cameron has previously said that the fourth and fifth movies are mapped out (though they have yet to be officially greenlit). “Avatar: The Way of Water” brought in $2.32 billion globally.",

        "content": "“Jeanne du Barry” director Maïwenn is setting the record straight on her altercation with Mediapart editor-in-chief Edwy Plenel.Maïwenn confirmed earlier this year that she did in fact pull Plenel’s hair and spit in his face at a Paris restaurant; Plenel filed a police report March 7 alleging the incident took place in late February. The writer/director/actress, née Maïwenn Le Besco, told French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche (via Screen Daily) that the encounter with Plenel stemmed from her feeling “morally violated” that Mediapart published rape allegations against her ex-husband, director Luc Besson, without notifying her.“I don’t blame Mediapart for their investigations into Luc Besson; I blame them for what they have done to me,” she said. “It was a cataclysm. I felt morally violated. There’s no justification for attacking a journalist, but there’s no justification for violating a woman’s intimacy and trust.”Per Maïwenn, she met with a Mediapart journalist in late 2018 for an off-the-record conversation. Maïwenn also testified during actress Sand Van Roy’s investigation in June 2020 on the order of the court. The case against Besson was dismissed in 2021 after an investigation.Yet in early 2021, Paris Match and Mediapart published excerpts from Maïwenn’s testimony without notifying her, despite Mediapart previously promising to give her 48 hours’ notice for the sake of her daughter with Besson. Maïwenn filed a civil suit against Paris Match and lost; she opted to not file a claim against Mediapart.Maïwenn was married to Besson in 1992; she was 16 years old when they wed. The “Léon, the Professional” director knew Maïwenn since she was age 12, and the couple began dating when the actress was 15 years old. The couple divorced in 1997.Mediapart editor-in-chief Plenel asked for an apology from Maïwenn over the encounter. However, Maïwenn said she “proposed a discussion” instead. “He doesn’t want to discuss, or try to understand, he just wants me to bow down,” she said of Plenel.While her film garnered backlash for casting controversial figure Johnny Depp in the lead male role for “Jeanne du Barry,” Maïwenn responded to criticisms, saying, “I’ve been making films for the past 17 years, against a backdrop of women fighting for respect. We can’t reduce everything to the Johnny Depp controversy and turn the few nuances I’m trying to introduce into the debate against me and my films.”Mediapart editor-in-chief Plenel called out Maïwenn’s presumed lack of support for the #MeToo movement in May 2023.“She’s outspokenly anti-#MeToo and she made a gesture to please her world, and that’s why she bragged about it on TV,” Plenel told Variety. “We could see a sort of pride that echoed that world.”Plenel said at the time, “We published what [Maïwenn] told police as part of the investigation into Besson. When she talked to the police, she discussed complicated aspects of her relationship with Luc Besson, notably during their separation. But once we published our piece, we never received any protest of any kind. That was about five years [ago] — that would mean that for all this time, Maiwenn wanted to take her revenge.”",

        "content": "Steven Soderbergh isn’t losing sleep over the rise of artificial intelligence in Hollywood.The “Full Circle” limited series director told Variety during the Tribeca Festival that A.I. can “absolutely not” finish a full script on its own.“I may be the Neville Chamberlain of this subject, but I am not afraid of A.I. in this specific context. It has no life experience,” Soderbergh said. “It’s never been hungover. It’s never made a meal for anybody it loved. It’s never been scared walking home late at night. It’s never felt insecure because somebody that it went to high school with 20 years ago has become incredibly successful. I’m not afraid of it. It’s just another tool.”The “Magic Mike’s Last Dance” director added, “If it helps you finish a first draft of a script, great. But can it finish that thing and make it great on its own? Absolutely not. As of today, it is not keeping me up at night.”One of the contentions of the ongoing WGA strike is the threatening rise of A.I. in the writers room. Soderbergh spoke on the strike itself, saying, “All I will say is that we are at a critical juncture in the business in a number of different areas, which is why this is so complicated. But I sure would like more information about how things are being viewed and monetized coming from the other side. The black box of it all doesn’t make me comfortable.”“Black Mirror” creator Charlie Brooker recently admitted that he tried using ChatGPT to write an episode of the technology-driven psychological thriller anthology series.“The first thing I did was type ‘generate “Black Mirror” episode’ and it comes up with something that, at first glance, reads plausibly, but on second glance, is shit,” Brooker said. “Because all it’s done is look up all the synopses of ‘Black Mirror’ episodes, and sort of mush them together. Then if you dig a bit more deeply you go, ‘Oh, there’s not actually any real original thought here.'”He noted, similar to Soderbergh, that ChatGPT did work as a tool to point out the overlapping themes across episodes.Soderbergh’s upcoming Max limited series “Full Circle” centers on a botched kidnapping that uncovers an underworld of secrets in present-day New York City.

        "content": "Jennifer Lawrence is putting her past dreams of directing to the side.The “No Hard Feelings” actress revealed during Good Morning America that she is not looking to helm a project anytime soon.“You know, I used to think that [I wanted to direct], and now I’m just so tired,” the Oscar winner said. “And it just looks so hard.”The “Winter’s Bone” breakout star was attached in 2015 to direct “Project Delirium,” based on the New Yorker article “Operation Delirium” published in 2012 about military doctors running experiments on soldiers during the Cold War. Lawrence previously revealed ambitions to direct since she was 16.Now to GMA, Lawrence, who produces director Gene Stupnitsky’s “No Hard Feelings,” shared that she was hesitant to even jump back into working after welcoming her first child with husband Cooke Maroney, whom Stupnitsky actually introduced her to.“I had just had a baby, so I definitely wasn’t planning on working,” Lawrence said. “There is just once you start your family, it’s the greatest thing in the world. I’m just going to try to take in every second and be present and enjoy it.”As a producer, the “Causeway” actress-producer noted, “It’s busy, but focused and streamlined. I don’t take on anything that I can’t personally read every draft of and give notes on.”Plus, Lawrence credited “No Hard Feelings” co-star and “Dear Evan Hansen” actor Andrew Barth Feldman for completing the comedy casting. Without Feldman, Lawrence said the film could not have been made.“We just wouldn’t have made the movie if we couldn’t find the right Percy,” she said, “and we auditioned some great actors. And it was just immediate. He’s so smart and cool and dialed. And he put off going to Harvard to do this movie, very Percy like.”“No Hard Feelings” releases on June 23.",

        "content": "“Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” actor Tenoch Huerta is addressing the sexual assault allegation against him.Huerta, who portrayed villain Namor in the MCU film, was accused by musician María Elena Ríos of “emotional abuse” and called a “sexual predator” in a series of Twitter posts over the weekend. Huerta took to Instagram (via Variety) to refute the accusation.“About a year ago, I dated Elena for several months,” Huerta wrote. “It was entirely consensual at all times, as countless others can attest. And throughout it was a loving, warm and mutually supportive relationship. After it ended, however, Elena began to misrepresent our interactions both privately and in front of groups of mutual friends.”He continued, “As a result, a few months ago, I engaged a legal team to commence the appropriate actions to protect my reputation and refute these irresponsible and false accusations that can cause great prejudice and damage. Although I am by no means perfect, I know that these allegations are simply untrue. And while I will always work to improve myself, I need to contest claims that are both false and offensive.”Huerta concluded, “I am deeply grateful to my family and the people who have supported me and greatly appreciate everyone who is willing to look at the facts and reflect before rushing to an untrue and unjust conclusion.”A representative for Marvel did not immediately reply to IndieWire’s request for comment. Huerta’s Namor made his debut in the “Black Panther” sequel, which released last year, though Marvel Studios has not yet established when the actor’s character will reappear in the MCU.Ríos previously posted that it was “very difficult to talk about the emotional abuse and the abuse of power of a sexual predator who is loved around the world for playing a character in a movie such as Tenoch Huerta” due to his role in the Marvel film.",

        "title": "Wes Anderson Stands by Bill Murray Amid Misconduct Claims: ‘He Is Really Part of My Family’",
        "content": "Wes Anderson is standing by Bill Murray amid sexual misconduct claims against the actor.After numerous harassment accusations and a formal complaint on the “Being Mortal” set, Murray chalked up his behavior to the changing state of comedy in the current culture. He added that he is hoping to “make peace with it.”“Asteroid City” filmmaker and frequent Murray collaborator Anderson told IndieWire’s Eric Kohn that the allegations against Murray will in no way impact their working relationship.“My experience with Bill is so extensive. Bill was such a great supporter of me from the very beginning,” Anderson said. “I don’t want to speak about somebody else’s experience, but he’s really part of my family. You know, he’s my daughter’s godfather. In fact, he actually baptized her. He’s the one who splashed the water.”They have worked together on films including “Rushmore,” “The Royal Tenenbaums,” “The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,” “The Darjeeling Limited,” “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” “Fantastic Mr. Fox,” and more. He is not in Anderson’s new film “Asteroid City,” out June 16.Anderson continued, “Bill was supposed to be in the movie [‘Asteroid City’]. It’s not a great thing to say, ‘Well this person was supposed to play this part.’ Once someone gets a part, you’re supposed to say, ‘Well, this is their part.’ But in this case, because there was some confusion about what happened with Bill. He was supposed to play the motel manager who Steve Carell plays, and Bill got COVID four days before he was supposed to start shooting. He was in Ireland and in the case of our movie, we had schedules of so many people that are all puzzled around. The people who Bill was supposed to play scenes with were going to be gone by the time he cleared the COVID protocols and stuff. And in fact, he was quite sick. So Bill missed his part and Steve Carell came in quite suddenly. He was great, I loved having him. I met him, he arrived, and we were immediately shooting.”The “Rushmore” director added, “Then when Bill got better, he came to Spain. At the end of the movie [where ‘Asteroid’ shot], we finished the movie, and Bill and I got in a car and drove to France. It was a great way to finish but it was the first time I hadn’t had him in a movie in a long time.”Murray has starred in nine of Anderson’s films and had the lead role in “The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou.”Anderson credited his decades-long personal relationships with actors like Murray for giving his films a distinct flavor.“You know, the people I work with — Owen [Wilson], Bill, and Jason [Schwartzman] — these are people I have such a long thing with that when I don’t have them, gosh, I feel they’re missing,” Anderson said. “But at the same time, it’s probably not the worst thing in the world. I always love having new people. It just expands the whole range of it. You know, we have other movies.”Anderson’s upcoming films include Roald Dahl adaptation “The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar” starring Ralph Fiennes, Dev Patel, Ben Kingsley and Richard Ayoade; the film is set to debut on Netflix in Fall 2023. The director additionally confirmed to IndieWire that an unnamed film starring Michael Cera will begin shooting later this year. Jeff Goldblum and Benicio Del Toro are rumored to also be cast; Goldblum appeared in “Asteroid City” and Del Toro worked with Anderson on “The French Dispatch.”Eric Kohn contributed reporting.Stay tuned for IndieWire’s full interview with Wes Anderson later this week.",

        "title": "‘The Documentary Film Industry Is in Crisis’: The Unspoken Traumas of the Filmmaking Community",
        "content": "Documentary film editors are like crash test dummies, according to Alexis Johnson. You keep letting yourself crash, assuming the seatbelts will work, over and over again just to see what impact a scene is having on you.“If I am going to harness a feeling, I have to feel it myself,” she said, recalling working on director Alex Gibney’s powerful 2021 documentary “The Forever Prisoner,” about the CIA’s interrogation treatment of prisoner Abu Zubaydah. In addition to the countless hours reworking scenes of waterboarding and other harsh treatments, Johnson edited a sequence that depicts the technique of playing high-decibel music to terrorize a prisoner. It was particularly grueling, as Johnson repeatedly subjected herself to the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ cacophonous “Give It Away” for hours while shaping the depiction of Zubaydah being tortured by the same song. By the end of working on “The Forever Prisoner,” Johnson said, she was not “in a good headspace,” without knowing why. It is a common phenomenon that is finally being addressed. “The documentary film industry is in crisis,” said Rebecca Day, a British psychotherapist who is a co-founder of DocuMentality, an initiative being led by her private practice, Film in Mind, and concerned filmmakers who are pushing the documentary film community to talk more openly about the issue of mental health. “We can easily say that. Our research backs that up.” DocuMentality, led by one of its cofounders, clinical social worker Malikkah Rollins, hosted a symposium and released a report at this May’s Hot Docs documentary film festival in Toronto. The report came after more than 150 filmmakers from the U.S., Canada and Great Britain were divided into 21 focus groups, 100 percent of whom reported having “mental health struggles as a direct result of making films,” according to Day. At the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma, a Columbia Journalism School project focused on supporting journalists who cover trauma, there has been a “huge change,” according to its executive director Bruce Shapiro. In the past two years, more than a dozen production companies, including first-time filmmakers and Academy Award winners, have commissioned the Dart Center for training and consultation. “Until recently, we had very limited engagement or interest from the documentary world,” Shapiro says.  Day and other psychotherapists are becoming a regular presence at industry gatherings, including film festivals, where they are invited to host workshops and panel discussions. At this year’s Sundance Film Festival, Utah’s Huntsman Mental Health Institute oversaw a “Coping with PTSD for Documentary Filmmakers” panel, where Oscar-nominated filmmakers Matthew Heineman and Jehane Noujaim spoke vividly about their own struggles. Heineman gave emotional testimony about suffering from PTSD and having perpetual nightmares after being embedded with Mexican drug cartels (“Cartel Land”) and American forces in Afghanistan (“Retrograde”).“These films change you. They change who you are. They change you physiologically,” said Heinemen, who described the severe psychological strain of receiving desperate entreaties for help from Afghans trying to flee the Taliban. This public discourse comes on the heels of the pandemic, which prompted a sea change of mental health awareness in all trades. In the documentary world, the momentum had already been building after a series of tragic suicides, albeit each with its own complicated backstory rooted in unique histories of depression not necessarily related to the profession. Yet, considered together, their impact on nonfiction filmmakers as a group has been palpable. In 2014, Swedish documentarian Malik Bendjelloul died by suicide a year after winning an Oscar for his “Searching for Sugar Man.” And although he worked on big-budget feature films, the death of British location scout Michael Harm in 2017 propelled a film and media industry-wide discussion in Great Britain. The non-profit organization, The Film and TV Charity, responded to Harm’s death by conducting a much-publicized survey of professionals, including nonfiction filmmakers, which found that more than half of respondents had considered taking their own lives.And then in March 2019, Andrew Berends, a documentary director (“Delta Boys”) and cameraman (“Free Solo”) beloved in the American documentary film world, died by suicide after struggling with depression and having received a diagnosis of Parkinson’s. “Iraq in Fragments” director James Longley wrote movingly in Documentary Magazine, the publication of the International Documentary Association (IDA), about Berends, with words that could clearly resonate with his peers. “It was probably in Iraq where Andy both found his calling and lost himself. He lost himself in conveying the stark realities of other people, in becoming their voice, their witness,” Longley wrote. “The things he saw took their toll. Our only defense is a movie camera, and it can be a very thin shield to hold back the enormity of the world.” Berends’ death was a “huge reckoning,” according to Doug Block, a veteran documentarian and DocuMentality cofounder. “Documentary filmmakers tend to be good people who want to help humanity,” he said. “They don’t think of themselves. And they are suffering.” Block, who founded the D-Word, an online gathering of more than 22,000 documentary professionals, says that Berends’ death was a “big motivating factor” behind the D-Word starting an online thread about mental health, which quickly accumulated an unprecedented number of posts marked by “exceptional length and extraordinary candor,” according to Block. Documentary Magazine continued the conversation by publishing a first-person essay in early 2021 by veteran documentary cinematographer Jenni Morello, in which she described harrowing work experiences that inspired long-after-production crying jags in the supermarket aisle. Morello wrote of documentary filmmakers becoming “empathy sponges” and how “eventually the sponge becomes full.” The magazine also dedicated a special issue to mental health in the fall of 2021.“If filmmakers weren’t having to struggle so hard to survive, they would have more time to process the impact of the films they work on,” said Day, the psychotherapist, who is also a former documentary filmmaker. She had seen such a critical need for care that she took three years to train so that she could specifically treat people who work in documentary films. Over the past five years, her practice, Film in Mind, has treated patients with a list of ailments that include chronic fatigue, addiction, development of autoimmune diseases, back pain, inability to sleep, and loss of appetite. Day points to two main pressure points: The inherent psychological challenges of making non-fiction films about traumatizing subjects and the difficulties that filmmakers face working in an industry that can be maddening to navigate, lacking in resources, and isolating because of its hierarchical structure, diffuse community and often solitary work.She describes two kinds of trauma; first hand, because many filmmakers, such as Matthew Heineman, expose themselves to dangerous conditions and also because many directors are drawn to themes that they have personal experience with. And there is also secondhand, or vicarious, trauma, where the filmmakers absorb the hurt and distress of their subjects. This can happen in the field or after, particularly when directors and editors spend days watching and rewatching hours of filming. “The role of filmmakers can be a lot like therapists,” said Day, who expresses incredulity that documentarians expose themselves to such intense work without the proper training of, say, therapists, who maintain networks of supervision support and see their own therapists. “It wouldn’t be ethical to do what we do if we didn’t have the right training,” she said.“Filmmaking can be hell on earth and it can rest in your muscles and in your pores,” said “Victim/Suspect” director Nancy Schwartzman, who has made three films about sexual assault (“Roll Red Roll”), including her first documentary, “The Line,” in which she confronts her own assailant. “Victim/Suspect,” which came out in May on Netflix, is about sexual assault survivors who are accused by the police of making false reports.  When she is done filming, Schwartzman does “lots of stuff” to care for herself, including body work and therapy. “It’s your job to work on yourself,” she said, adding that making documentaries can also be “amazing” and she feels “joy” in her work. “But it’s not for everybody.” “I find digging into terrible actions and dark human impulses helps me feel more empowered and less victimized,” Schwartzman added, acknowledging the paradoxical nature of making a documentary that “is not about you, but because you are the filter, it absolutely has to go through you.”Schwartzman partly felt comfortable working with cinematographer Jenni Morello on “Victim/Suspect” after having read her essay in Documentary Magazine. Both filmmakers are careful about who they collaborate with. The two had many conversations about the “heaviness,” according to Morello, of what they were portraying. Throughout the “Victim/Suspect” shoot, members of the production would check in on each other. The filmmakers made sure that they could count on each other so that, most important, they could “hold space,” says Schwartzman, for the film’s subjects to feel comfortable, even empowered, during interviews. These sorts of deliberate, intentional conversations between filmmakers are happening with greater frequency, according to documentary director and editor Chithra Jeyaram. “I work best with filmmakers who understand that there’s a clear intrinsic value in a project,” she said. “If the incentive is for a festival or to pay the bills, it’s not going to be fruitful.”It has taken more than a decade for Jeyaram to achieve what she calls an “equilibrium” regarding her personal life and work as a filmmaker. In 2014, primarily distraught over her unfulfilled desire to become a mother, she attempted to take her own life. She was diagnosed with severe situational depression. In the mental health ward, where she was not allowed electronic devices, Jeyaram saw a newspaper article where she read about Bendjelloul. It was shocking to Jeyaram to see such a vivid example of how success could not bring happiness. “How we process the journey is far more important than the outcome,” she said. “As a filmmaker and as a human being, I understand that much better now.”For the past five years, Jeyaram has been working on a documentary, “Our Daughters,” about adoption. “It has given me so much joy. Making the film has broadened my understanding of motherhood,” she said. “I wasn’t expecting that. I had thought it would help me learn how to adopt.”The film has accumulated many of the grants and sort of festival and foundation support that gives it a chance to be recognized by the industry, but Jeyaram is adamant about keeping her priorities straight. “I am in the place where if the film doesn’t do well in the marketplace, it will be OK,” she said. “It has already done for me, as a human being, what I had hoped for.”This reframing of success is one of the major goals that DocuMentality hopes can help alleviate some of the stresses of being a documentary filmmaker. But changing filmmakers’ minds is just one step. Day and others are hoping that structural change is also possible, starting with making access to funding less hierarchical and alienating. “We need to equalize the position of filmmakers with funders and broadcasters and the organizations that support films,” Day said. “We need to change the power balance so that filmmakers feel that they have autonomy.”Normalizing mental health support for filmmakers would be another achievement, according to Day. Streaming companies such as Netflix and Max are beginning to offer certain productions mental health supervisors to assist filmmakers. Morello, for instance, was offered such support by Netflix on “Victim/Suspect.”Day also imagines a formalized health and safety assessment for productions so that funders and filmmakers are locked in on the potential strains that could come from greenlighting a documentary that might last years. Putting up guard rails would undoubtedly help filmmakers, but there’s no way to entirely protect those who choose to portray the most disturbing reaches of human experience. The Dart Center’s research director, Elana Newman, a professor of psychology at the University of Tulsa, described a “dance of approach and avoidance” when it comes to documentarians who portray trauma. “There’s a dance when anyone is responding to something traumatizing,” she said. “They either go straight for it or they are repelled by it.”This paradoxical tension has always been at play in documentaries that portray suffering, and it’s becoming part of the vernacular both on screen and off. For example, at Sundance this year, the heart-wrenching and disturbingly graphic documentary “20 Days in Mariupol” portrays the horrors of the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine. In the film, which will be released in July, Ukrainian director Mstyslav Chernov narrates, “My brain wants desperately to forget all this but the camera won’t let it happen.” According to Newman, Chernov’s narration embodies the complexity of both a traumatized mind as well as the perspective of the documentary filmmaker. “Now that documentaries are telling more stories about trauma,” she said. “Filmmakers are coming to us because they don’t have the tools for working through these very complicated issues. We try to help them.” ",

        "content": "Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are clarifying that they do not “consent” to the use of audio from “Air” by Donald Trump.Affleck and Damon’s production company Artists Equity issued a statement in response to the former president sharing an excerpt of Damon’s impassioned speech from the feature film that charts the collaboration between Nike and Michael Jordan.“Money can buy you almost anything, but it can’t buy you immortality,” Damon’s character says in the clip. “That, you have to earn.”Trump posted the two-and-a-half minute monologue on his Truth Social page.A representative for Artists Equity told Variety, “We had no foreknowledge of, did not consent to and do not endorse or approve any footage or audio from ‘Air’ being repurposed by the Trump campaign as a political advertisement or for any other use. Specifically in terms of any and all rights available to us under U.S. copyright and intellectual property law, we hereby, expressly give notice that in the case of any use of material from ‘Air’ by the Trump campaign where approval or consent is required, we do not grant such consent.”Trump’s Truth Social has a manifesto posted on its homepage, reading in part: “We are watching our Republic DIE before our very eyes. The Biden-appointed Special Counsel has INDICTED me in yet another witch hunt regarding documents that I had the RIGHT to declassify as President of the United States.”The statement continues, “This witch hunt began when the FBI RAIDED my home and then staged it to look like a made-for-TV crime scene with police sirens and flashing red and blue lights.”Trump was indicted March 30 in New York on felony charges. The former “Apprentice” host additionally faces multiple other criminal investigations, including Georgia voter tampering during the 2020 election.As for “Air,” actor and producer Damon previously said at SXSW that it was a “natural progression” for longtime pal and collaborator Affleck to direct him onscreen.“We’ve written a bunch of movies and produced and acted together for so many years and decades, so it didn’t feel any different, working this way,” Damon said.Affleck added, “We’ve gotten that question a lot, I keep thinking, ‘Should it have felt different?’ Because it felt exactly the same. And what was really wonderful about it was, I love and trust Matt so much, and it was so lovely to be working together, it was kind of like a feeling of, I want the other actors to feel [this too]. Like, ‘Come on, it’s all good, I love actors, I love you, you’re going to be OK, everyone, take as much time as you want, do what you need to do and be respected, and to kind of project that energy.”",

        "title": "‘Cold Copy’ Review: Heavy-Handed Journalism Thriller Is Staler Than Print Media",
        "content": "It doesn’t exactly scream “nuance” when a film begins with a character explicitly laying out their values in a monologue. Anyone who was unsure what they were walking into before seeing “Cold Copy” will have their confusion instantly clarified when it opens on journalism student Mia Scott (Bel Powley) rattling off a bunch of buzzwords about speaking truth to power and telling stories that shape our society. If you typed out the entire soliloquy and put it on a tote bag, it probably would have been one of the best-selling items of the 2017 holiday season in the New York Times merch store.The heavy-handed monologue is indicative of the larger problems looming over “Cold Copy.” While the film never quite devolves into the Resistance-era morality play that the opening scene threatens us with, its exploration of personal ambition and power dynamics in the workplace isn’t much better. Roxine Helberg’s directorial debut constantly reminds us that our world exists in complicated shades of gray, but the story that it tells is painfully black and white.On paper, Mia has everything that student should need to become a professional journalist. She’s ambitious, curious, thorough, and deeply committed to the idea of the Fourth Estate. Unfortunately, she doesn’t have the connections. As she watches her nepo baby friends break into elite institutions at a much faster rate than she does, the opportunity to take a class taught by cable news icon Diane Heger (Tracee Ellis Ross) seems like the opportunity of a lifetime.But her hopes of finding a nurturing mentor are quickly dashed when she actually meets Diane face-to-face. The host of “The Night Report” rose to prominence for eviscerating her powerful interview subjects, and she’s no more forgiving of her journalism students. She frequently berates Mia for what she views as regurgitating the opinions of others rather than developing her own, and Mia’s attempts to talk her way into a job quickly go nowhere.Mia understands that her final project — producing her own documentary segment on a subject of her choice — is her last hope of impressing Diane, so she begins to throw her ethics to the wind. She decides to profile the teenage son of a recently deceased children’s author in an attempt to infiltrate his media-shy family and expose the gory details of his mother’s death.Diane is considerably more interested in Mia’s ruthless pursuit of salacious details than her principled screeds, and the rule breaking eventually lands Mia a coveted job as her assistant. The post gives Mia an opportunity to see the cutthroat world of cable news for what it really is, and Diane encourages her to bend even more rules in her quest to tell an entertaining story. The Diane that we see at work bears almost no resemblance to the intellectual persona that she puts on in the classroom. Mia soon learns that all the academic theory in the world can’t teach her the real lesson of the course: elite journalists do whatever it takes to survive.Unfortunately, “Cold Copy” adds nothing new to the time-honored “twisted mentor pushes their brilliant student to the limits” movie that we’ve seen many times before. Attempts to combine “Whiplash” and “The Newsroom” unfold in a predictable pattern, and the writing invokes many of the worst journalism movie tropes. (Exchanges such as “That story was milked to death,” “Oh yeah? I remember your hands being all over those udders” are unfortunately common occurrences.) By the time Diane asks Mia to sign a contract that’s “just basic legal stuff” without reading it, it’s hard to imagine anyone who has ever seen a movie before not immediately guessing what’s coming.What’s particularly depressing about “Cold Copy” is the fact that the current TV journalism landscape contains no shortage of cinematic angles. Anyone who read Tim Alberta’s gripping Chris Licht profile in The Atlantic can attest to the fact that the business is facing one existential crisis on top of another. The question of establishing journalistic credibility while chasing ratings in an attention economy continues to stump the industry’s finest minds — and that’s before you factor in the inevitable decline of linear television. With so many new journalism stories begging to be told, there’s simply no reason to retread old ones this poorly.“Cold Copy” premiered at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "content": "In the nine years since Elizabeth Olsen first appeared as Scarlet Witch in “Captain America: The Winter Soldier,” the actress has gradually become one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s biggest stars. From playing key roles in tentpole films like “Avengers: Endgame” and “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” to launching Marvel’s TV empire with “WandaVision,” Olsen has been a constant presence in the MCU.But the actress doesn’t have any future Marvel appearances lined up — and she’s okay with that. In a conversation with Meghann Fahy as part of Variety’s Actors on Actors series, Olsen reflected on her decade-spanning run in the MCU. While she had positive things to say about the experience, she told Fahy that she isn’t dying to suit up again anytime soon.“No, I don’t,” Olsen said when asked if she misses playing Scarlet Witch. “I think it’s been almost 10 years of playing her. And I’ve loved it. And I think the reason why I am not calling Kevin Feige every day with ideas is because I’m really proud of what we were able to do. I think ‘WandaVision’ was a really surprising opportunity.”Olsen made it clear that she is creatively satisfied with her Marvel movies and enjoyed working with the studio — but she’s also enjoying the break. “If someone were to tell me that I’m fired from Marvel movies, I will feel proud of what we made,” she said. “And I really am just trying to figure out how to load up other films and characters so it becomes less about the Marvel of it all.”It appears that Olsen is practicing what she preaches. The “WandaVision” star has recently spoken about the importance of finding a balance between superhero and non-superhero movies. When she was asked to offer advice for young actors being courted by Marvel, Olsen suggested that they avoid locking themselves into multi-film contracts right off the bat.“Just give them one,” she said.  “I think that way you have more control over…If you, let’s say, ‘Oh my God, this is the most fun I’ve ever had and I love this character so much, I want to do it again,’ you now have more creative control for the next one.”",

        "content": "A better-than-expected showing for “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” (Paramount) is only one reason why this is a good box-office weekend. The expensive Hasbro toy franchise ($200 million before marketing) grossed $110 million overseas, above its $60.5 million domestic take. Greater international strength was expected, and needed: It will need well over $500 million worldwide to cover its costs and there’s intense competition ahead,starting with Warner Bros. Discovery’s “The Flash” June 16.If summer 2023 has a shot at the hoped-for $4 billion (six weekends in, it’s on par with with last summer’s $3.4 billion), films like “Transformers” need robust openings. Stage two is sustaining strong runs.That’s what #2 “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” (Sony) and #3 “The Little Mermaid” (Disney) did to buttress the weekend. The Marvel animated film, faced with the loss of most of its premium screens and “Transformers” competition, grossed more than $55 million this weekend. Ten days in, it’s already has bested the original “Spider-Verse” and stands at $225 million domestic, $377 million worldwide.“Mermaid” fell 45 percent in its third weekend, bringing it to $229 million domestic. Similar to “Spider-Verse,” foreign lags behind at $185 million. That’s problematic on a $250 million budget, but its domestic performance remains impressive.“The Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3” and “The Boogeyman” (both Disney) and “Fast X” and “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” (both Universal) all dropped less than 50 percent. Still, at this time of year the #4 film should be grossing over $10 million. On this weekend in 2019, “Rocket Man” was in its second week as the #5 film with a gross of nearly $14 million. The summer needs multiple films with eight-figure weekends.With only 26 theaters, “Past Lives” (A24) made the top 10. Its $520,000 gross/$20,000 per-theater average is the best second-week expansion since “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” Even more impressive is this film features a first-time director, no star names, and chose to open outside the awards season. As it adds theaters in the next two weeks, “Past Lives” is positioned to clear the $10 million mark most 2023 Oscar contenders struggled to exceed.Next Friday sees Wes Anderson’s “Asteroid City” (Focus) open in six theaters. That will be a litmus test for the recovery of specialized releases.The best platform opening was Anton Corbijn’s documentary “Squaring the Circle” (The Story of Hipgnosis) from Utopia. With event shows Friday boosting the response, it grossed $10,011 at New York’s Film Forum. Los Angeles opens next week and a national release will quickly follow.Compared to 2022, which saw “Jurassic World: Dominion” open to $145 million, this weekend’s total of $165 million was down $50 million, or 23 percent. That’s on par with 2019. Year to date, box-office performance is 25 percent above last year and on a full-year basis that would translate to $9.25 billion. The four-week rolling comparison to 2019 rises to a terrific 98 percent, although the year-to-date figure is much lower.1.

        "title": "Sylvester Stallone Now Acknowledges That Arnold Schwarzenegger Was a ‘Superior’ Action Star",
        "content": "The 1980s rivalry between Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone is the stuff of Hollywood legends, but the two action stars have mended some fences now that they’re not competing at the box office every year. Stallone even makes an appearance in the new Netflix documentary “Arnold” to praise his former enemy for reinventing the action genre. He recalled that the action film landscape that the two men entered was dramatically different from the one that they created together.“The ’80s was a very interesting time because the definitive ‘action guy’ had not really been formed yet,” Stallone said. “Up until that time, action was a car chase like ‘Bullitt’ or ‘The French Connection.’ A film all about intellect and innuendo and verbal this and verbal that.”Once the ’80s came around, humans replaced cars as the primary drivers of action in these blockbusters. Stallone credited Schwarzenegger with being one of the first actors to drive that physical approach to action filmmaking.“You actually relied upon your body to tell the story,” he said. “Dialogue was not necessary. I saw that there was an opportunity, because no one else was doing this except some other guy from Austria, who doesn’t need to say much… He was superior. He just had all the answers. He had the body. He had the strength. That was his character.”Stallone recalled that Schwarzenegger’s impressive musculature made him much more durable on set and allowed him to keep filming through injuries that would have hindered other actors.“I had to get my ass kicked constantly, whereas Arnold, he never got hurt much,” he said. “And I’m going, ‘Arnold, you could go out and fight a dragon and you’d come back with a Band-Aid.’” For his part, Schwarzenegger was quick to return the favor and heap praise on Stallone. He explained that the “Rocky” writer’s creativity prevented him from resting on his laurels and forced him to keep innovating in order to stay relevant. “Every time he came out with a movie like ‘Rambo II,’ I had to figure out a way of now outdoing that,” Schwarzenegger said.  “Without Stallone, I maybe wouldn’t have been as motivated in the ’80s to do the kind of movies that I did and to work as hard as I did. I’m a competitive person.” “Arnold” is now streaming on Netflix.",

        "title": "‘Eric LaRue’ Review: Michael Shannon’s Directorial Debut Is a Quiet Triumph",
        "content": "Who has ownership of grief or blame in the midst of a tragedy?Michael Shannon‘s directorial debut “Eric LaRue” beautifully unpacks how the sins of the son impact both the father and mother in his adaptation of Brett Neveu’s 2002 play of the same name. Judy Greer and Alexander Skarsgård portray two parents whose teenage son — unseen until the final moments of the film — murdered three classmates in a school shooting, and the duo are left in the wake of the violence to rebuild in their small community.Greer’s Janice aimlessly wonders how culpable she is in her serial killer son’s actions, while her husband finds solace in joining a new church and becoming very close friends with his fellow congregation member and human resources executive, played by a perfectly unhinged Alison Pill. Their entire suburban community onscreen is built upon the mundanity of conformity, complete with Janice’s job at a Big Lots-adjacent big box retailer and her husband’s penchant for drinking beers alone at Sizzlin’ Sallies.Janice is pressured at every turn, even by her boss, to participate in a sit-down therapy session with the three mothers of the deceased boys that Janice’s son Eric murdered. While Janice avoids even visiting Eric in prison, she is torn between cleaning out his room and grappling with the role of faith and religion. Is she to blame for her son’s actions? And if not, who is?Greer is a force onscreen, opposite a barely-recognizable Skarsgård, who fully delves into a performance that should draw comparisons to a chameleon-like cosplay of Jeff from “Yellowjackets” (in the best way possible). Both characters seek forgiveness from each other as parents and from the community at large.Janice asks of her husband, her coworkers, and even the audience what she is “supposed to be feeling” as the mother of a monster. Her negligence is balanced with something more deeply-seated, a knowingness that Eric was destined for disaster even as an infant. As Eric later begs his mother to make sure she tells her friends that he feels remorseful, Janice can’t feel anything at all. It’s best experienced within the confines of Shannon’s film, even if that ultimately means many moments of profound discomfort.“Eric LaRue” also deftly balances moments of dark comedy thanks to the absurdity of the circumstances that unfold after an unthinkable tragedy. Playwright and frequent Shannon collaborator Neveu adapted his own play for the screen, and Shannon’s sensitive direction makes “Eric LaRue” a haunting, standout film with a career-best performance from Greer.“Eric LaRue” premiered at 2023 Tribeca Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "title": "‘Take Care of Maya’ Review: An Infuriating Documentary with No Easy Answers",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival. Netflix releases the film on its streaming platform on Monday, June 19.When Maya Kowalski was 10 years old, the once-vibrant Florida youngster started exhibiting a worrying array of ailments: Her feet began cramping and curling inward, she couldn’t stop coughing, headaches nearly incapacitated her, and lesions appeared on her limbs. Her doting parents, Jack and Beata, were desperate for not even a cure but simply a diagnosis of what was ailing their beloved firstborn. For Beata, a Polish immigrant and nurse known for her direct nature, it was yet another challenge to overcome, another medical mystery to unravel.What would unfold over the next few years was a nightmare even the always-prepared Beata couldn’t possibly predict, a complicated story with a heartbreaking — and wholly unfinished — conclusion that should terrify everyone. First-time feature filmmaker Henry Roosevelt attempts to unpack what happened to the Kowalskis (and, as the film eventually alleges, what has happened to many other American families) in the documentary “Take Care of Maya,” a wrenching and ultimately incomplete look at an unbelievable true story.If the shades of this story — sick kid, dedicated mom, a family tale with unexpectedly wide implications — sounds familiar, perhaps you’ve already read Dyan Neary’s excellent 2022 article in The Cut or one of Daphne Chen’s pieces from the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, and know where this story ends. And while Roosevelt doesn’t try to obscure the tragedy that consumes the documentary’s final act, the pains with which the filmmaker goes to unspool his film in a linear fashion, all the better to attempt to find the truth in a complex story, are a wise choice.Less effective are the various perspectives Roosevelt dips in and out of while telling that story. What happened to Maya and Beata has (and will likely only continue to) inspire all kinds of controversy, with everything from Maya’s eventual diagnosis and the treatment the Kowalskis pursued to the actions of a local hospital and the Pinellas County child-protection team up for debate, but Roosevelt’s film wavers between taking a clear stance on any of the issues at hand.Not that that’s necessary for a documentary — where, typically, objectivity would rule — but Roosevelt attempts to have things both ways, diving deep into the lives of the Kowalskis while also including surveillance footage from Maya’s many hospital stays that seems to slyly refute the family’s own experience. That means it’s up to viewers to draw their own conclusions, but “Take Care of Maya” doesn’t provide nearly enough information to allow for that. What it does provide, however, is heartbreaking and infuriating, a document of a bizarre tragedy that seems destined to never get full closure for anyone involved.The facts, as slippery as that term may be in this instance, are as follows and are neatly laid out in Roosevelt’s film: After Maya started experiencing her ailments, few doctors could pinpoint a diagnosis until Dr. Anthony Kirkpatrick offered one that came complete with a controversial “cure.” Kirkpatrick alleged that Maya had CRPS (“complex regional pain syndrome”), a rare form of chronic pain that tends to afflict young girls most often and is, much like chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia, misunderstood often to the point of derision. To heal Maya, Kirkpatrick started her on a ketamine regime, eventually ending with a dose so intense that it was meant to put her into a five-day coma.When Maya woke up, she felt better until she didn’t. Months after her coma, Beata and Jack took her to a local hospital for treatment, where the various doctors, nurses, and social workers eventually concluded that Maya was not sick and that meticulous and direct Beata was actually the ailing one, suffering from Munchausen syndrome by proxy (hello, “The Act”). For nearly three months, Maya stayed in the hospital — where her insurance company was, ironically, billed for her CRPS treatment — while her family, especially Beata, were kept away from her and ruthlessly investigated by the state of Florida.Roosevelt has a wealth of material to work with in telling this story, thanks to Beata’s detailed notes and audio recordings, plus a number of interviews with various talking heads and even deposition material from the eventual lawsuits that are skin-crawling in about five different ways. At times, “Take Care of Maya” feels almost too personal, as Roosevelt follows the Kowalskis during some of their darkest days, burrowing inside a broken family and only being able to show us the pieces.That sense of a story rendered incomplete, of answers we may never fully know, is at the heart of the Kowalskis’ story, but Roosevelt’s film is unable to square that with the constraints and demands of a feature film. Just as one story comes to a horrible close, others begin to spin outward, none of them able to find any sense of closure or completion, just more pain, no cure.“Take Care of Maya” premiered at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival. It will start streaming on Netflix on Monday, June 19.",

        "title": "‘Bucky F*cking Dent’ Review: David Duchovny Adds a Wistful New Chapter to the Baseball Movie Canon",
        "content": "Baseball breeds romantics. Whether the sport itself invokes big-sky dreaming via its laid-back nature and open-ended gameplay, or America’s pastime dons nostalgia’s rose-colored glasses simply by enduring for a century and a half, who can say? Based on more than a hundred years of baseball movies, filmmaking fans have posited their own theories, their own connections, their own interpretations of what the diamond means, often interpreting the game as an extension of life itself.Add one more to the canon. “Bucky F*cking Dent” casts its core story — of a dying father seeking forgiveness from his estranged son — against the 1978 pennant race between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox. David Duchovny, adapting his own book of the same name and starring as the departing dad, never betrays his wistful, tender-hearted family drama by shifting focus to a game decided 45 years prior; instead, he deftly incorporates baseball’s poetic nature and passionate pull to steady his characters — to push them together, when life’s hardships try to tear them apart.While wobbly in places and reliant on a familiar plot, “Bucky F*cking Dent” finds fresh life in its nuanced central relationship, charming period details, and a stirring performance from Duchovny — while eliciting well-earned sobs from anyone who can’t help but feel romantic about baseball.Teddy (Logan Marshall-Green) is drifting through life. For his day job, he sells peanuts at Yankee Stadium, drawing cheers and applause for his on-target throws and spirited personality. But outside his low-pressure, go-nowhere gig, he’s alone and uninspired. Teddy tries selling his writing to publishers, but the rejection letters are piling up, and his latest meeting with an agent (played by Pamela Adlon) ends with the suggestion he needs to commit a crime. “You’re a real writer, but you’ve got nothing to write about — you write like you haven’t lived,” she says. “You’re an uninteresting white man living in uninteresting times.”The Caucasian part he can’t change, but rather than face pain through prison time, Teddy is soon called to the hospital, where he finds out his dad, Marty, has been diagnosed with lung cancer and heart disease. He has less than a year to live, and he’s not seeking any further treatment — except for yoga sessions with a side of therapy from a nurse/”death specialist.” Mariana (Stephanie Beatriz) has been seeing Marty for a few months, helping him cope with a rapidly approaching end, but when Teddy realizes there’s no one staying with his coughing, slow-moving father, he volunteers to come over and help out.It’s then, after spending a little time with his crotchety, joke-cracking old man that Teddy spots a connection. When Marty’s beloved Red Sox are winning, he’s in much better spirits. He’s lively and cheerful. He moves about on his own, and he’s open to new ideas. (A son giving dear ol’ dad his first hit of pot makes for great family bonding.) But when the Red Sox luck runs out — as it has for 60 years to that point in time — Marty pulls away. He sleeps more, eats less, and talks little.His health seems tied to his team, so Teddy comes up with a plan to make sure the Sox stay hot. Each morning, he swipes the paper and either hides it under his bed or alters the headlines accordingly. He breaks the TV (provoking a humorous shout from Marty reminiscent of any dad: “It’s broken already? Goddamn TV’s only 15 years old!”) and, with the help of a few of his father’s friends, even fakes rain-outs by running water down the windows with a hose and faking thunder by waving tin baking trays.Teddy convinces himself (and others) that lying to his father is worth it in order to keep him alive. Mariana even reluctantly agrees to keep the secret, but it’s clear to her (and the viewer) that Teddy just needs a little more time with his dad. Baseball is just the excuse that facilitates conversation, as it so often is for parents of a certain age and demeanor. One gets the sense Marty knows this even better than his son, and it’s the father’s eagerness to reconnect mixed with a reluctance to address what specifically caused their split that makes him so endearing.“Bucky F*cking Dent” doesn’t rest its emotional climax around a single revelation; it pecks away at Marty, drawing out embarrassing tidbits here and repressed truths there until Teddy can discover the heart of his dad’s anguish. By the time they get there, it all hits home, and along the way, there’s plenty to enjoy.Duchovny the writer-director stages a mini-“Californication” reunion, with Adlon as Teddy’s agent alongside Evan Handler (as Marty’s barber) and Jason Beghe (as a friend). The cast is strong, especially Beatriz, though Marshall-Green takes some time settling in and never quite brings enough raw earnestness to Teddy, who starts off lost and slowly finds conviction. But Marty is the heart of the film, and Duchovny’s sensitive turn — pivoting on the actor’s droll humor and coarse vulnerability — carries the movie home.“Baseball is the only game that death is jealous of,” Marty narrates, midway through the film. “Baseball defeats time. Only baseball has the possibility of going on forever. As long as you don’t get that third out in the ninth inning, there’s a chance that you could win, a chance that you could play on, a chance that you could never die.”All games end, as does every life, but “Bucky F*cking Dent” dials in on that faith, that hope, that chance at immortality with such intimacy, you’ll believe it all can just keep going, at least long enough to realize what matters.“Bucky F*cking Dent” premiered at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "title": "‘The Graduates’ Review: Restrained Drama Follows Life After a Shattering School Shooting",
        "content": "Even one year later, the wall filled with good wishes (posters reading “we can overcome,” cards telling us to “always remember”) still stands. Sometimes, a new item is even added to it, a fresh remembrance of a wound that cannot heal. When Hannah Peterson’s restrained yet enormously affecting feature directorial debut “The Graduates” opens, the inhabitants of an unnamed, small-town high school have maintained their altar. It’s all they can do in the wake of a high school shooting that left six teens dead, and forever scarred those they left behind.The details of that shooting are never fully divulged, just one of many graceful choices Peterson adopts for her first feature. Instead, Peterson’s film is about the world that exists after a terrible crime, not the one before, not the one during, certainly not the one that caused it. In this world, there are only survivors, and they’ve all pursued different versions of what “normal” feels like after the worst possible thing has happened. (Of note: the film makes for a wonderful companion piece to Megan Park’s SXSW winner “The Fallout,” though both filmmakers approach similar material with different, just as vivid viewpoints.)Mostly, there’s an extraordinary Mina Sundwall, cast here as soon-to-be-graduated-senior Genevieve, who lost her boyfriend Tyler in the shooting. And while Tyler (Daniel Kim), who we soon learn through shared memories and plenty of goofy iPhone videos (which Gen watches with almost religious fervor), was always ready with a joke, adored chicken tenders (to like, an extreme degree), and believed whole-heartedly in his delightful girlfriend.But Tyler didn’t just leave behind Genevieve: there’s also his grief-stricken dad John (a heartbreaking John Cho), who still coaches the high school’s boys’ basketball team because being with those boys connects him to their murdered teammate, and his best friend Ben (“Moonlight” star Alex Hibbert), who fled town after the shooting and has only recently returned. Each of Tyler’s bereaved mourns him in different ways, unable to process their lives without him (like Gen, Ben often uses his phone to connect with Tyler, calling the still-working number to leave voicemail messages, a detail that pays off enormously in one of the film’s final scenes).And life certainly does look and feel different. There are the metal detectors at the entrances of the school, repeated requests to “be safe” from still-stricken teachers, and a distinct lack of interest in what the future might hold. Genevieve, a talented photographer, is looking to take a gap year because she didn’t get into any colleges, Ben has fully dropped out, and John refuses to move to Houston to be with his partner and her charming daughter. No one can move forward, but living in the past is simply too painful.Despite such heavy material, Peterson still finds moments of lightness, even joy, for her characters. Ben and Gen spark to life when they’re with their pals, trading stories about Tyler and edging closer to a complicated bond of a different kind, while John’s fixation on the basketball team often seems like the only thing keeping him afloat. But even these people, who have suffered the same tragedy and even mourn the same person, are often unable to connect with each other. When Gen’s mother (the always-welcome Maria Dizzia) suggests she talk to someone who understands what she’s going through, she snaps: Who could possibly understand what she’s going through?It’s at this apparent impasse where Peterson’s film blossoms. Peterson, who has been mentored by both Chloé Zhao and Sean Baker (Zhao also serves as a producer on the film), clearly has a passion for chronicling, if not real life, stories that feel achingly, almost painfully real. The rhythms and movements of “The Graduates” mirror those of life — there are no grand gestures here, no sudden revelations, no massive shifts. Instead, the film and its characters have to find space and hope in the everyday. (Peterson also edits the film, yet another thing she’s good at.)Peterson, who shared the film’s press notes that she was partially inspired to make the film after she lost a brother to suicide, clearly comes from a place of great love for both survivors and those we lost, but also a place of profound pain, and an understanding of the shape that takes. But that pain also shapes people, like Gen, Ben, and John, who must reckon with that means, what it looks like, what it feels like. “The Graduates” is a compelling version of that in film form, a story that needs to be told, made by a filmmaker who we can only hope has many more tales to share.“The Graduates” premiered at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "title": "Steven Caple Jr. Explains the Hasbro Crossover in ‘Transformers: Rise of the Beasts’: ‘You Could Go Any Direction’",
        "content": "[Editor’s Note: The following article contains major spoilers for “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts.”]Robotic gorillas and ’90s needle drops weren’t the only changes to the “Transformers” franchise introduced in the new prequel “Rise of the Beasts.” The film ends with a surprise appearance from Michael Kelly as a military officer attempting to recruit Anthony Ramos’ Noah to join him in an intergalactic war. The secret agency he works for? G.I. Joe.The scene has been seen by many as the start of a Hasbro Cinematic Universe that could unite the “Transformers” and “G.I. Joe” brands in a larger story. In a new interview with Uproxx, director Steven Caple Jr. explained the decision to cast Kelly in the pivotal role and teased what could be next for the two toy franchises.“We wanted to make sure whoever we use isn’t like a full-blown Nick Fury,” Caple said. “When you start to do the compare and contrast to the other franchise. So, for me, it just felt like there was a way to bring in Michael. He’s a phenomenal actor. And so to have him in the mix and be able to build a team out would’ve been really cool. But you could go any direction with him. If he wanted to be a villain, if he wanted to be a good guy, if he wanted to be down for the cause, you just don’t know. So he just felt valuable that way.”Caple made it clear that he hopes to be heavily involved in building out the new cinematic universe, which would begin with a rebooted cast of “G.I. Joe” characters entering the world of “Transformers.”“Yes. 100 percent. That is my plan for sure,” he said when asked about rebooting the “G.I. Joe” franchise while continuing to work on “Transformers” movies. “I think that’s one we have to wait on. But I’m always ‘Transformers.’ I want to say always ‘Transformers.’ But, I mean, between you and I, I know you’ll read this later, but when you look at it, there is a Transformer, G.I. Joe collaboration in the comic books. And I read it years ago and I thought this idea would always been cool. So I’m not going to say I’m staying true to that storyline, but the fact that it was more so ‘G.I. Joe’ stepping into their world was interesting to me.”“Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” is now playing in theaters.",

        "title": "Michael Shannon Says It ‘Wasn’t Quite Satisfying’ Returning as General Zod in ‘The Flash’: It’s Like ‘Playing with Action Figures’",
        "content": "When “The Flash” opens in theaters next weekend, comic book fans will be treated to a litany of cameos from returning DC stars. Both Michael Keaton and Ben Affleck are reprising their iterations of Batman, and Nicolas Cage will finally get a chance to suit up as Superman. Zack Snyder’s “Man of Steel” will be represented as well, as Michael Shannon is returning as the villainous General Zod.In a new interview with Collider, Shannon shared some thoughts about his return to the DC Extended Universe — and they weren’t all positive. He explained that while multiverse movies create great opportunities for actors to reprise beloved roles, they often strip those roles of the humanity that made them compelling in the first place.“Yeah. I’m not gonna lie, it wasn’t quite satisfying for me, as an actor. These multiverse movies are like somebody playing with action figures,” Shannon said about his experience making “The Flash.” “It’s like, ‘Here’s this person. Here’s that person. And they’re fighting!’ It’s not quite the in-depth character study situation that I honestly felt ‘Man of Steel’ was. Whether people think that’s crazy or not, I don’t even care. I really felt like ‘Man of Steel’ was actually a pretty sophisticated story. I feel like ‘The Flash’ is too, but it’s not Zod’s story. I’m basically there to present a challenge.”He continued: “It’s pretty crazy. I didn’t ever think I would be an action figure. I never imagined that for myself. I can’t take all the credit because the action figure isn’t me. It’s General Zod. That would be weird, if I actually had my own Michael Shannon action figure.”Despite any creative gripes that Shannon had with “The Flash,” the actor has had kind words for his embattled co-star Ezra Miller. Despite the actor’s multitude of legal troubles, Shannon recently explained that he sympathizes with Miller because he understands the pressures of working in the public eye.“I thought Ezra was lovely — very kind to me when I was there,” he said. “It’s difficult to talk about, but I always give people a lot of slack in this business, because there’s a lot of people in this business that have issues. And some people have more privacy than others.”",

        "title": "Why Does Ezra Miller Get a ‘Flash’ Pass, but Not Woody Allen or Roman Polanski?",
        "content": "Kohn’s Corner is a weekly column about the challenges and opportunities of sustaining American film culture.This week provided a confluence of contentious developments for the film industry, and I’m not talking about the ongoing writers strike. First reviews of “The Flash” dropped ahead of the movie’s release and while they’re definitely mixed, the movie doesn’t seem destined for the dustbin despite its ostracized lead. Ezra Miller’s assault charges haven’t gone away, but that hasn’t deterred Warner Bros. from hurtling toward the theatrical release plan and mitigating Miller’s scandal however it can. Miller, of course, stayed out of the spotlight while the studio ramped up buzz. Tracking for the June 16 release in the unremarkable $70 million-$75 million range, which means it may not be the summer’s most profitable blockbuster. However, the hype machine ensured that audiences won’t cancel “The Flash” alongside its troubled star. No matter how it dances around the subject, the studio couldn’t care less about the allegations against Miller. It’s another story for two octogenarian filmmakers revered decades before Miller was born. You can run, but you can’t hide, from the discourse around Woody Allen and Roman Polanski: Both have new movies this fall.On Monday, a day before “The Flash” reviews dropped, the first trailer for Allen’s French-language “Coup de Chance” made the rounds. Shot, like Allen’s last several projects, with European financing, the director’s 50th movie promises an atmospheric love triangle with a dark Chabrolian twist not unlike his first-rate thriller “Match Point” 18 years ago. If you have any relationship to Allen’s work beyond his problematic reputation, there are reasons to be intrigued.My French is nonexistent, but with a little help from Google Translate’s live audio feature I could discern the outline of a thorny marriage drama in which one woman’s bond with her husband gets troubled by the reappearance of an old high school friend. Allen’s dialogue can sometimes sound a bit stale or antiquated, but other languages can inject it with renewed urgency, as Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem proved with their delightful Spanish bickering throughout “Vicky Cristina Barcelona.” I have long felt that the discourse around Allen’s movies vs. what he did or didn’t do to be unworthy of endless scrutiny because the quality of his movies weren’t worth the battle either way. “Coup de Chance” presents a different kind of conundrum, because it looks… well, kind of good. Is that enough for U.S. buyers to take a chance on it? Even asking that question states the problem at hand.“I bet no one will want the headache,” one American buyer wrote me this week. “I don’t think they’d give the rights away,” another said. Allen’s movies, after all, don’t come cheap. “Coup de Chance” boasts cinematographer Vitorio Storaro’s lush imagery and a big cast that includes adored French star Melvin Poupaud; it has French distribution set with Metropolitan Filmexport, which releases the movie there on September 27 (leading to speculation of a Venice Film Festival launch). Ultimately, various output deals mean that Allen’s work can quietly make its way to American audiences on streaming without the hassle of a marketing plan.“Rainy Day in New York” and “Rifkin’s Festival,” the two movies he’s made since the American industry abandoned him in the wake of the #MeToo movement, eventually became available (and found audiences) on Amazon — the same company that dumped his multi-film contract after 2017’s “Wonder Wheel.” In all likelihood, “Coup de Chance” will follow a similar path. Also in September (exactly one day after “Coup de Chance”) is the Italian release of Roman Polanski’s “The Palace,” a dark comedy set on New Year’s Eve 1999 at a hotel in the Swiss Alps. The movie was co-written by Polanski’s fellow Polish director Jerzy Skowlimowski in their first team-up since “Knife in the Water” over 50 years ago. Skowlimowski managed to go an entire Oscar season promoting “EO” last year without having to answer for Polanski’s own problematic reputation, but any business that attempts to release the movie stateside won’t have that luxury. Distributing a Polanski movie is a death wish in America. At least, that would appear to be the logic given that his last undertaking, the Cesare-winning “An Officer and a Spy,” never came out here. Yet Polanski’s earlier works continue to enjoy a healthy life at retrospectives around the country. If audiences want to see his latest, why wouldn’t a buyer take the risk? First off, of course, no one wants the tsuris — but there’s a far more practical reason beyond that. In the currently challenged specialized market, the odds of losing money on a theatrical release for these films is high — and that would be true even if the filmmakers had spotless records in their personal lives. The fact that they don’t only erodes what is already a small possibility of profit into a nub.However, I question the cancellation narrative in a world where Miller gets a “Flash” pass and movies that — to be frank — look a whole lot better remain in exile. I’m not here to relitigate anyone’s guilt, only to call attention to a double standard. Distributing a new movie from Allen or Polanski wouldn’t imply an endorsement of the men behind the camera so much as an acknowledgement that audiences want to see these movies.I’m sure some readers will find even the implication of support for Allen and Polanski to be worthy of some cancellation in its own right. To be clear, based on all available evidence, I find both repellent. But again, the conundrum here has less to do with questions of culpability than quality. If “Coup de Chance” and “The Palace” have enough aesthetic substance to warrant the release of their work, getting them out there may be a headache worth having — for the business and the state of an art form. If indeed nobody takes that gamble, it’s only a matter of time before they arrive here on VOD. As with “The Flash,” one way or another, audiences will have the last word. As usual, I welcome feedback on this column: eric@indiewire.com",

        "title": "‘Bad Things’ Review: Queer ‘Shining’ Is a Refreshing Twist on Slashers",
        "content": "“Bad Things” is a great amount of fun as a lo-fi slasher with a killer cast. Writer-director Stewart Thorndike’s sophomore feature, following the 2014 breakout film “Lyle,” is a queer take on “The Shining,” centered on a deserted motel in a sleepy snow-filled suburb. Gayle Rankin (“GLOW”) leads the film as Ruthie, the heir to the Comley Suites, who also has a traumatic tie to the hotel itself.Ruthie and her three pals, including girlfriend Cal (Hari Nef), hole up for a weekend getaway at the campy motel, which has been in disrepair ever since Ruthie’s grandmother died. Ruthie’s mother is somewhere roaming the property, but she keeps dodging both Ruthie’s texts and her hook-up handyman, Brian (Jared Abrahamson). Tensions mount as Brian lingers around and Cal waits for Ruthie to propose, despite her being unfaithful with Fran (a delicious Annabelle Dexter-Jones), who is Maddie’s (Rad Pereira) friend with benefits.Yet the main foursome prefer to focus on the undead instead of their very alive dramas: Maddie and Cal trade stories of past Comley Suites guests, including ’80s models who went out for a jog and never returned. “Ghosts are going to be really good for the brand,” Cal teases. It’s only when the spirits come back to haunt the core friend group that it seems spirits are no longer sexy.Ruthie’s own horrific childhood experience at Comley is uncovered later on: Her mother dropped her off at the closed hotel during a snowstorm, only for Ruthie to almost lose three of her fingers to frostbite and starve over days until she was found. To distract herself from her inner demons, Ruthie becomes obsessed with watching a hospitality consultant, portrayed by a pitch-perfect Molly Ringwald looking like she hasn’t aged a day since the ’80s herself. Ruthie imagines her as a surrogate mother…while also masturbating to her commanding image.“Bad Things” leans a little too strongly on “The Shining” inspiration at times, complete with a bar scene homage. However, the film’s lo-fi quality and stellar cast chemistry makes the feature an easily watchable horror film. Dexter-Jones’ deadpan delivery is reminiscent of a sultry Wednesday Addams; coupled with Nef’s inherent lovability, the duo’s comedic timing grounds the film, especially while Rankin becomes more and more unhinged.“Bad Things” blunders when it comes to the action sequences, but the campiness is part of the charm. The film constantly questions what is real or not, who is alive and who is dead, and what are ghosts or Ruthie’s own memories. Thorndike, who is among IndieWire’s queer filmmakers to watch, shines best in the first half of the feature with lingering shots on the emptiness of both the vast hallways and Ruthie’s own morality. It’s only when Ruthie is wielding a chainsaw in a feral state of desperation that “Bad Things” tips too far tonally, but “Bad Things” is still a very good time.“Bad Things” premiered at the 2023 Film Festival and will be released by Shudder on Friday, August 18.",

        "title": "‘The Line’ Review: Alex Wolff Transforms for Fraternity Thriller Rooted in Toxic Male Group-Think",
        "content": "Editor’s Note: This review was originally published during the 2023 Tribeca Festival. Utopia opens “The Line” in theaters Friday, October 18.All for one and one for all — so long as the hierarchy of class, race, and wealth stays in line. Filmmaker Ethan Berger’s feature narrative debut “The Line” premiered at 2023 Tribeca is absolutely one of the most accurate films about fraternity life ever made. Why? Well, aside from the homophobic jokes, competitive tension between brothers, and the racist response to non-conforming female love interests, the casting feels more like a documentary than a scripted fictional feature.Berger, who cowrote the script with Alex Russek after years of research into Greek life, directs lead star Alex Wolff who went full Method acting to portray Tom, a working student who has second thoughts about his roommate Mitch’s (Bo Mitchell) obsession with mouthy pledge Gettys (Austin Abrams). Tom tells his mother that being part of (fictional) fraternity Kappa Nu Alpha (KNA) is key to landing postgrad jobs; it’s all about the relationships built between brothers. Mitch’s father (John Malkovich), who has a monopoly on the meat market, casually offers Tom an internship over dinner, while fraternity president Todd (Lewis Pullman) asks Tom to accompany him to lunch with the university’s dean of students.It’s no matter that Tom is already losing himself in the Southern group-think behind the frat, even going so far as to adopt a “faux Forrest Gump accent,” according to his mom. And the “your mom” quips continue into the fraternity walls, as Tom teases Mitch for his hot trophy mother (Denise Richards) and posters of women’s thong-clad rear ends are “eaten” by the brothers through frequent licking.The arrival of new pledge Gettys throws the delicate balance of testosterone into disarray, though, as Todd has a special bond from back home with the conceited freshman. “I’m just trying to fuck the most girls and have the most fun,” Gettys says when asked why he wants to join KNA. Tom assures him both will happen, but not to lose sight that three presidents of the U.S. are also KNA alums.The fraternity has to set an example on campus, between making fun of “Black lesbian” Annabelle (Halle Bailey) and snorting cocaine. Gettys proves to be invaluable at first, warning his fellow potential brothers about the downsides of cunninglingus on a prostitute (STDs, obviously) and why it’s the worst thing possible to be perceived as gay.The shifting power structures between Todd, Gettys, Tom, and Mitch unfold as a game of musical chairs over which brother is viewed as a “liability” to the greater cause of the fraternity itself. Bobby (Angus Cloud) serves as comic relief and the epitome of the always-high frat bro, one who fits with Tom’s assertion to love interest Annabelle that his brothers are just a bunch of (direct quote) “harmless retards.”“The Line” is set in 2014, which explains the existence of Gettys’ soon-to-be-iconic dance acting out the NSFW lyrics to The Wanted’s dated hit “Glad You Came.” Abrams is a force onscreen, expertly paired with Mitchell’s haunting take on a too-rich-to-fail teen who glowers in the face of Wolff’s feelings of being town between doing what he thinks is right and what sounds like good, old-fashioned frat fun.A fatal accident (or was it premeditated?) in the latter third of the film leads the core group of fraternity brothers to be interrogated by a detective (Scoot McNairy) in a finale reminiscent of “Promising Young Woman.” No one can go against the system, or fully step out of line. The repercussions, if any, will always be unequal. A final shot using real news footage of Penn State freshman Timothy Piazza, who died during hazing rituals, caps off the Tribeca breakout film. “The Line” is a must-see for a peek behind the coke-filled sheets of fraternities, well, everywhere.“The Line” premiered at 2023 Tribeca Film Festival.

        "title": "‘He Went That Way’ Review: A Serial Killer, A Drifter, and His Monkey Get Into a Car…",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival. Vertical releases the film in theaters on Friday, January 5 with a VOD release to follow on Friday, January 12.Like “Singin’ in the Rain” and “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” before it, “He Went That Way” tells the story of an iconic performer struggling to adapt to changing public tastes. Unlike those films, the performer in question is a monkey named Spanky.In the late 1950s, Spanky dominated the variety show circuit with his mastery of the beloved midcentury comedy trope known as “monkeys doing things that monkeys don’t typically do.” But in a post-Beatles America in 1964, family-friendly chimp hijinks just aren’t enough to impress the Ed Sullivans and Perry Comos of the world. The monkey that was once the most popular TV star in America is now scrounging for gigs.Nobody has paid a steeper price for Spanky’s fall from grace more than his handler, Jim (Zachary Quinto). A middle-aged man who broke one of the cardinal rules of finance (“Never put 100 percent of your resources into a monkey-centric family entertainment act”), he’s now cruising Route 66 in a car he can barely afford to repair with a monkey he can barely afford to feed. But the road is not without its perks — he gets to avoid his wife that he barely speaks to and his creepy priest brother who owes him a ton of cash.Aside from the whole “staking his future on the idea that monkeys will never go out of style” thing, Jim is a pretty risk-averse guy. But when he sees a devastatingly handsome 19-year-old hitching a ride, he throws caution into the wind and picks him up. His new travel buddy Bobby (Jacob Elordi) claims that he’s heading for Chicago to reconnect with an old girlfriend — a narrative that begins to fall apart when he pulls a gun on Jim.As it turns out, Bobby didn’t just want a to accompany Jim to Chicago — he wanted to rob and most likely murder him. It’s kind of his thing. The sociopathic teenager lurks the backroads of America in search of free rides, only to brutally kill anyone who shows him a hint of generosity. He takes Jim’s wallet and his prized ring — and he still has the guts to ask for a lift to Chicago.He offers Jim a dangerous bargain: safe passage to the Windy City in exchange for the return of his jewelry and the safety of his chimp. Given that Jim has just lost virtually everything he has in this world, he has little choice but to go along. What follows is a tense cross-country drive that’s underscored by the knowledge that Bobby could kill Jim (and Spanky) at any time. Bobby keeps playing psychotic games with Jim’s mind only to pause and pursue a genuine connection with him — before reverting back to psychological torture at the drop of a hat. As the two men get to know each other, the film shifts its focus so sharply towards their relationship that it’s almost startling when you remember that there’s a monkey involved.Director Jeffrey Darling’s neon-tinged rendering of roadside America is sumptuous to look at, and Elordi exudes the movie star gravitas that Bobby needs to lull Jim into his trap. But the relationship between the two men is just never fleshed out enough to be convincing. We’re meant to believe that Bobby’s willingness to overcome his sadistic nature is the result of some kind of inexplicable bond between the two men, but the connection never quite materializes in a satisfactory way.A pile of indie film stock tropes — long shots of cigarettes being lit, a guy howling with joy out the window while driving at sunset, and the dreaded “Most of This Actually Happened” title card — aren’t enough to salvage a competent but emotionally thin story.But if nothing else, “He Went That Way” deserves credit for being the most serious effort at reviving the monkey hijinks genre that the festival circuit has seen in years. For all of the progress that America has enjoyed since 1964, one metric that we have undeniably lost ground on is “quantity of monkey movies released per year.” Spanky might be criminally underused, but his mere presence is a step in the right direction. If Darling’s film can get the ball rolling on an arthouse ape chase renaissance, all of its sins will be forgiven.“He Went That Way” premiered at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival.",

        "title": "Russos on Tarantino’s MCU Takedown: ‘I Don’t Know If Quentin Feels Like He Was Born to Make a Marvel Movie’",
        "content": "The Russo Brothers are calling out Quentin Tarantino‘s comments on the MCU.Joe and Anthony Russo responded to the Oscar winner’s numerous digs at the superhero franchise, telling The New Yorker that Tarantino’s “relationship to the source material” most likely affects his dislike of the manufactured process behind making Marvel movies.“I don’t know if Quentin feels like he was born to make a Marvel movie,” Anthony Russo said, “which is maybe why he would feel like a hired hand doing it. It depends on your relationship to the source material.”Joe Russo added, “What fulfills us the most is building a sense of community around our work.”The “Jackie Brown” director said in November 2022 that he is against the “Marvel-ization of Hollywood,” namely when it comes to the ecosystem of studio stars.“You have all these actors who have become famous playing these characters,” Tarantino explained. “But they’re not movie stars. Right? Captain America is the star. Or Thor is the star. I mean, I’m not the first person to say that. I think that’s been said a zillion times…but it’s like, you know, it’s these franchise characters that become a star.”He clarified his feelings towards the MCU franchise: “I don’t love them. No, I don’t — I don’t hate them. All right. But I don’t love them. Right. I mean, look, I used to collect Marvel comics like crazy when I was a kid. There’s an aspect that if these movies were coming out when I was in my twenties, I would totally be fucking happy and totally love them. I mean, they wouldn’t be the only movies being made. They would be those movies amongst other movies. But, you know, I’m almost 60, so yeah. No, I’m not quite as excited about them.”Tarantino concluded, “My only ax to grind against them is they’re the only things that seem to be made. And they’re the only things that seem to generate any kind of excitement amongst a fan base or even like for the studio making them. That’s what they’re excited about. And, you know, so it’s just the fact that they are the entire representation of this era of movies right now. There’s not really much room for anything else. That’s my problem.”",

        "title": "‘Persian Lessons’ Review: Moral Dilemmas Become Dangerous Games in Holocaust Melodrama",
        "content": "When Gilles (Nahuel Pérez Biscayart) is arrested by Nazis and put on a train to a concentration camp, he has every reason to believe that his life is over. It’s 1942 in Nazi-occupied France, and all of his Jewish traveling companions are making peace with their inevitable deaths. When a stranger on the train begs him to trade half of a sandwich for a book of Persian myths, he makes the deal out of mere charity as much as anything else.That chance encounter that kicks off “Persian Lessons” ends up saving his life, as Gilles is the only passenger spared. As it turns out, the Nazi officer who controls his destiny has been “looking for a Persian.” Klaus Koch (Lars Eidinger) is already thinking ahead to the end of WWII — the former chef plans to move to Tehran and open a German restaurant in the desert. But before he can do that, he needs somebody to teach him to speak Farsi.Gilles is not remotely Persian, but the Jewish Frenchman’s complexion allows him to pass as Middle Eastern. Sensing a possible lifeline, he poses as a Persian and agrees to start teaching the Nazi a language that he has no knowledge of.The cunning prisoner quickly realizes that making up words that sound vaguely foreign is enough to fool the dim-witted guard. After working long shifts in the kitchen, the two men study by candlelight as Gilles helps Klaus memorize complete gibberish. Over time they begin communicating to each other in a completely made-up code, with Klaus finding himself moved by the beauty and complexity of what he thinks is the Farsi language.Gilles starts receiving more favorable treatment around the camp, avoiding physical labor and being spared from “trips to Poland” that nobody ever returns from. At a certain point, the consequences of what he’s doing begin to weigh on him. Gilles doesn’t have much of a choice, as any other course of action would result in certain death. But as he takes over the camp’s bookkeeping and watches other men get killed so that he can live, there’s no avoiding the realization that he bears a sliver of complicity. Even men with no options can be burdened with doubts about their ethics.The random circumstances that lead to Gilles’ life-saving opportunity create an Asghar Farhadi-esque moral dilemma that serves as the film‘s core. There are countless movies that do a better job of engaging with the Holocaust, but Vadim Perelman’s film succeeds when it explores the lengths that humans are willing to go to ensure their own survival. Cinematographer Vladislav Opelyants compounds that effect by shooting the film with a storybook realism that accentuates the idea that we’re watching a fable. And Biscayart gives a deeply moving performance as Gilles, using the subtlest of facial expressions to convey the way he never stops scheming despite being deeply broken by the horrors he endures.But movies about the Holocaust always require a delicate balancing act, with the two generally accepted approaches being the brutality of “Schindler’s List” and the blatant satire of “JoJo Rabbit.” “Persian Lessons” is neither, existing near the fraught middle ground famously occupied by films like “Life is Beautiful.” It’s an old-school period piece that’s likely to please traditional arthouse audiences, but it sometimes drifts towards a feel-good narrative that can feel tone deaf when you consider the horrific backdrop of WWII. The intentions are undeniably good, but there’s an inadvertent crassness to the idea that a concentration camp inmate has to be responsible for teaching a Nazi how to see his prisoners as three dimensional humans.Fortunately, while the script flies too close to the sun on multiple occasions, it never fully devolves into the worst case scenario. Screenwriters Ilja Zofin and Wolfgang Kolhaase more or less stick the landing with a morally ambiguous ending that questions whether it’s ever possible to make deals with the devil — even when your own survival is on the line. But the lesson for filmmakers is not unlike the lesson that Gilles learned with Klaus — there’s no way to truly triumph in an unwinnable game.“Persian Lessons” is now playing in theaters in New York and Los Angeles, with a national release to follow in the coming weeks.",

        "content": "Netflix may get most of the attention, but it’s hardly a one-stop shop for cinephiles looking to stream essential classic and contemporary films. Each of the prominent streaming platforms caters to its own niche of film obsessives.From the boundless wonders of the Criterion Channel to the new frontiers of streaming offered by the likes of Disney+ and Max, IndieWire’s monthly guide highlights the best of what’s coming to every major streamer, with an eye toward exclusive titles that may help readers decide which of these services is right for them.Here is your guide for June 2023.Christian Blauvelt, Jude Dry, David Ehrlich, Eric Kohn, and Steph Green contributed to this article.Live-and-die-hard filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s final howl of anguish from the soul was 1982’s “Querelle,” his last and possibly gayest movie. It’s an adaptation of a novel by French libertine and gay icon Jean Genet, settling into a French port city where a madame played by Jeanne Moreau runs the world, and sailors engage in explicit sex acts that turn violent.

An out-of-body theatrical experience that makes its predecessor feel like a glorified proof-of-concept, “Avatar: The Way of Water” is such a staggering improvement over the original because its spectacle doesn’t have to compensate for its story; in vintage Cameron fashion, the movie’s spectacle is what allows its story to be told so well.Now available to stream.Film Movement+ has a strong lineup of LGBTQ+ films celebrating Pride this month.

Twenty-five days later, the same woman arrives back at her house in Augusta, Georgia to find two FBI agents with a search warrant for her property. She doesn’t look surprised.

Tina Satter’s fascinating directorial debut takes her startling indiscretion and spins it into something of a horror movie about the repercussions of Doing The Right Thing in the face of the United States’ surveillance system: a David and Goliath story where the stronger power slings stones squarely back in the underdog’s face.

Serra, the Catalan filmmaker behind such boundary-pushing works of experiential filmmaking as “Honor of the Knights” and “Story of My Death,” is yet another outsider coming to their shores, but he avoids the touristic travel-porn clichés of most movies set in some tropical locale. “Pacifiction” is not a vicarious experience of luxury; it is an experience of life.

His riveting performance is indisputably the heart and spine of the film. Because of the sensitive subject matter, Akin and his team had to use guerilla filmmaking tactics to shoot in the conservative country, giving the film a gorgeous cinema verite quality.

Her Lydia Tár, here the most famous female conductor in the world, allows Blanchett to dig into the sinews of her gifts while also reflecting on her own public-figure status and genius.Lydia’s interpersonal dealings with protégés, peers, fans, and colleagues become her inevitable destruction. Todd Field’s movie unfolds as a breakdown of the Lydia persona — and quite possibly of Blanchett’s as well, as the character attempts to triage her shattering public image. Field wrote the movie for Blanchett, and it’s easy to understand why: she is never less than absolutely riveting whether chewing out a Juilliard student for what she perceives is his inability to “sublimate” himself to his craft, or approaching a small girl in a schoolyard and telling her “I’ll get you” because she’s been rude to Lydia’s daughter.The last half hour, especially, is a showcase for Blanchett as the Lydia mask slips off and “Linda” is revealed. The movie leaves you uneasy about where either one’s legacy ends up. But one thing you’re absolutely sure of walking away from “TÁR”? It’s one of the greatest performances ever filmed.

        "title": "Universal Finally Answers That PVOD Revenue Question",
        "content": "Finally, some real numbers to assess the value of PVOD play for studios. And it’s a revelation.Top executives from Universal recently spoke at length to the New York Times, stating that the studio grossed $1 billion in less than three years (starting in July 2020). That’s when it began placing most of its films on PVOD after their third weekend (after 31 days if one opens to over $50 million).Theatrical box office is reported daily; judging actual VOD revenue, to put it charitably, is a crapshoot. Premium Video on Demand (usually $19.99 for a 48-hour rental) and VOD (ranging from $3.99-6.99, though normally $5.99) can only be judged by their relative position on charts from platforms like iTunes, Vudu, and Google Play.At IndieWire, we convey PVOD performance from the charts those three platforms provide on a weekly basis (here’s last week’s report, for instance), but they provide only rankings with inconsistent metrics (Vudu charts by revenue, others by transactions).Beyond the interesting details in the Times story (like tallies of over $50 million for “Jurassic World: Dominion,” “The Croods: A New Age,” and “Sing 2,” and a surprising $25 million for “News of the World” and “M3GAN”), the figures allow a better sense of the benefits to Universal. (Of note: Though not verified, a publicly traded company is required to be truthful in financial reporting.)For studios, VOD’s primary appeal is a revenue share of nearly 80 percent; with theaters, it’s close to 50/50. (Also: When Universal launched its three-week VOD policy in July 2020, theaters reportedly received slightly better terms).Since the pandemic, domestic box-office revenue for Universal (including its Focus division) is around $3.5 billion. That’s ahead of #2 Disney (including Searchlight) with $3.2 billion.Add Universal’s PVOD revenue, and the total is $4.5 billion. (PVOD includes some from the U.K., where windows are longer and the VOD platforms are less advanced. Universal sources tell IndieWire that it accounts for a small amount over the $1 billion reported.)In revenue terms, POV adds about 30 percent. But wait — it gets better for Universal.Its estimated theatrical film rental — best guess — is around $1.8 billion. PVOD comes to around $800 million. That’s 44 percent more.With the industry’s most aggressive PVOD program and the most movies (53 releases since January 2022), Universal has taken in the lead in box office. That also creates a virtuous cycle: The aggressive PVOD program makes it easier for them to produce more films.Three years ago, then-NBC/Universal president Jeff Shell announced its PVOD policy and AMC and Regal owner Cineworld suggested boycotting the studio. Universal mollified them with a deal — and today, while theaters may not love PVOD, more movies benefit theaters.Beyond theatrical exclusivity, the move to PVOD often sustains box office LINK since home marketing can also benefit the theaters still playing the film. That reinforces the idea that much of the PVOD audience rarely goes to theaters, and theater audiences would rather pay $20 for two tickets than the same amount for home viewing.The PVOD boost seems particularly important for Focus releases. Production and marketing costs for Focus releases are far below those of other Universal titles. With $5 million in PVOD revenue, around $4 million comes back to the studio. That’s the equivalent to about $8 million in theatrical gross, far more than most specialized titles take in. That makes it easier to greenlight these titles.Family films, a huge part of Universal’s recent success, seem utterly unharmed in their theatrical totals. After grossing $75 million, “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” added $110 million in box office after its PVOD release. While it’s an extreme case (“Puss in Boots” benefited from many weeks of being the sole kid-friendly film in theaters), that also represents millions of people who could have more easily spent that money while staying home.One result that could come from Universal’s revelations is to elevate PVOD in media coverage of platforms. Streaming is usually the fourth stage of release after theaters, PVOD, and VOD. But it isn’t just Universal that prioritizes PVOD, increasingly delaying streaming until all VOD revenues are maximized.Reporting numbers — whether grosses in theaters, or subscribers for streaming sites — concentrates attention on those elements. But in terms of direct impact on a film’s financial take, PVOD results have become a critical element. Getting specific data like this is important to understanding why early streaming has become less frequent after initial elevation. It also emphasizes how essential PVOD is in our ever-changing film financial ecosystem.",

        "title": "Designing a Showstopping and Terrifying Ursula for ‘The Little Mermaid’",
        "content": "Always the musical showman, “The Little Mermaid” director Rob Marshall insisted that the most gestural parts of Melissa McCarthy‘s live-action performance as Ursula were supported by eight puppeteered tentacles. This was especially vital during the Divine-inspired “Poor Unfortunate Souls” showstopper, where the sea witch lures Ariel (Halle Bailey) into a trap to become human.“For Rob, performance is the most important thing,” MPC VFX supervisor Patrick Ledda told IndieWire. “And, in particular, the musical beats. For instance, ‘Poor Unfortunate Souls’ was built in layers. The first version that Rob shot, he was literally using a Disney Ursula doll, and the set was just made of simple cardboard boxes, and he would move the doll around to create the journey of Ursula in this world. Then we did a previs pass to visualize the whole sequence very roughly.”This progressed to the eventual “dry for wet” shoot to simulate being underwater on a blue screen stage at Pinewood Studios in England. There, McCarthy was attached by a harness to a Tuning Fork rig on wheels, controlled and moved around by a couple of guys in blue suits. “It was all choreographed, and she was free to move her upper body and emote,” Ledda said. “Rob would then add that puppeteer performance of the tentacles, and they would match Melissa’s performance. Then once we got the plates with the puppeteers, we obviously replaced a lot of it and it became a digital performance.”Then came the time-consuming part: animating eight independently moving tentacles. First, they looked at lots of octopus references and added plenty of controls so that the MPC animators could manipulate the performance. “And then there would be some software that would automatically add secondary dynamics,” added Ledda. “So you end up with all these little curls and twirls like when you look at a real octopus.”“We had to figure out where to blend but, in the end, most of her body is digital,” he added. “We kept her hands and her face. That allowed us to take over just under the chest so we could have the stomach region and then blend that into the tentacles.”McCarthy’s hair was CG as well, which was hard because it needed to behave as if underwater, which can get messy and ugly. That required advanced techniques to manipulate artistically to Marshall’s liking. “Rob was quite picky,” Ledda said. “It was started as a simulation, but then we modified certain poses. We also wrote some tools where we could start in one direction and make sure the hair wants to go in that direction without being forced. We had a first pass on ‘Poor Unfortunate Souls,” which I love, but Rob felt that the hair was too loose. Then we did a whole other pass and it was too stiff, and eventually we landed where we wanted to.”The biggest decision was what to do about the underwater look of skin. Marshall wanted the look of the film overall to resemble “Blue Planet,” but he drew the line when it came to the facial performances of his actors, and opted instead for more appealing skin and eyes. “He wanted this more like the live-action portion where the actors were shot in a traditional way on a set,” Ledda said. “He didn’t want to modify the photography.”Meanwhile, for the climactic battle with “Big Ursula” attacking the kingdom and the ocean turning into a giant whirlpool, MPC upped its animation. The studio rewrote its water simulation to have greater latitude and artistic control to set the right properties.“Very early on, in very rough versions, Rob gave notes on the heights of the waves and the wind and all the other properties,” added Ledda. “And that was useful because we knew that we couldn’t wait until a proper final simulation for his notes. It took a long, long time. Rob had essentially no notes. On that sequence, once he saw close to the final image, he was very complimentary.”The animation of the character had its own challenges because the first version they did was essentially Ursula, only 47 times bigger. First, they did a facial capture session of McCarthy with some markers, directed by Marshall, to deliver the performance that would be translated into a giant zombie version of Ursula.“And that was the original idea, but it was difficult on that scale because it still looked like the same character. So it was a bit odd and some of the comments we got was that she wasn’t scary enough. It was going to be at night with complex water and the lightning, so we went through many rounds of concept work with our art department and Rob, and we landed on a version, to be honest, about three or four months before the delivery of the film.”But then there were concerns that Ursula was too scary for young kids after applying more octopus skin all over her face and neck, changing her pupil design, and making her hair more scraggly and dirty. So they played with how much to see of her. “Rob always had this idea that we never see her very well,” Ledda said. “It’s like you see flashes of her, but it’s not quite clear what you’re looking at. And that was the mysterious language that we landed on.”",

        "content": "Alden Ehrenreich is turning the camera lens on the pitfalls of celebrity.The “Fair Play” and “Solo” actor makes his directorial debut with “Shadow Brother Sunday,” a short film set to premiere at the 2023 Tribeca Festival. Ehrenreich also wrote the short, which centers on a down-on-his-luck musician returning home on the day of his younger brother’s movie premiere to steal his computer and sell it to the paparazzi. Watch the trailer, an IndieWire exclusive, in the video above.Nick Robinson stars as the high-profile brother, with Francis Ford Coppola executive producing. Ehrenreich made his feature acting debut in Coppola’s “Tetro” and went on to appear in the Oscar winner’s “Twixt.” The cast of “Shadow Brother Sunday” also includes Ana Auther, Lisa Edelstein, Elizabeth Guest, Nick Searcy, Ayah Weitz, and Jacob Wysocki.Ehrenreich isn’t the only A-lister behind a family-centric short film at Tribeca: Best Actor winner and “CODA” star Troy Kotsur explores his own real-life family ties with the documentary short “To My Father,” directed by Sean Schiavolin, while Tom Holland leads mother-son drama “Last Call,” which is helmed by his brother Harry Holland. This has been a big year for Ehrenreich. He appeared in box-office success “Cocaine Bear” and particularly made waves at Sundance with Chloe Domont’s breakout psychosexual feature “Fair Play,” which was purchased by Netflix in a staggering $20 million deal. Ehrenreich told IndieWire back at Sundance that he was drawn to the “nuanced and complex and thoroughly written” character, opposite co-star Phoebe Dynevor.“You’re very fortunate to get a quality of writing, to get to play characters that are this nuanced and complex and thoroughly written, but really at the end of the day, who you’re doing it with is everything. The fact that Phoebe and I got along the way we did and felt compatible in that way was really great, and rehearsal is just the thing that I’m shocked [is] not done more, and that it’s not studied as a craft in and of itself more. Especially with films about relationships,” Ehrenreich said. “When the firing squad comes in to film the movie, you have that ensemble built. It means everything, and you’re able to be more vulnerable and feel safer.”In addition to “Shadow Brother Sunday,” Ehrenreich can soon be seen in Christopher Nolan’s highly anticipated period piece “Oppenheimer” and Disney+’s Marvel limited series “Ironheart.”“Shadow Brother Sunday” premieres at the Tribeca Film Festival on June 9.IndieWire also shares the poster for the film, with original artwork by Ehrenreich and graphic design by Emma Berliner.",

        "content": "Amy Schumer is revealing that all was not perfect in Barbieland back in 2016.Schumer, who was originally attached to star in and co-write the live-action Barbie adaptation, said she will be seeing the “Barbie” movie starring Margot Robbie and directed by Greta Gerwig. However, Schumer said the original Sony film lacked a “feminist” take on the character like Gerwig’s film for Warner Bros. clearly does.“I can’t wait to see the movie, it looks awesome,” Schumer said on “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,” adding, “I think we said it was scheduling conflicts, that’s what we said. But yeah, it really was just creative differences.”Schumer continued, “But you know, there’s a new team behind it, and it looks like it’s very feminist and cool so I will be seeing the movie.”When “WWHL” host Andy Cohen asked if Schumer’s original film was not “feminist and cool,” the “Life and Beth” creator said, “Yeah.”Schumer was attached to the Barbie movie in 2016. She told The Hollywood Reporter in March 2022 that Sony “definitely didn’t want to do it the way I wanted to do it, the only way I was interested in doing it,” which led to her exiting the project. The official reason at the time was a scheduling conflict with Schumer’s 2018 film “I Feel Pretty,” but the comedian clarified that it was a creative split with Sony that led to the film being canceled and eventually moving to Warner Bros.Schumer’s Barbie was supposed to be exiled from Barbieland for not being perfect enough, with Schumer and sister and writing partner Kim Caramele writing the doll as an “ambitious inventor.” The studio asked that her invention be a high heel made out of Jell-O. Schumer also said that she was sent a pair of Manolo Blahniks to celebrate the film deal.“The idea that that’s just what every woman must want, right there, I should have gone, ‘You’ve got the wrong gal,'” Schumer explained at the time. “I felt like I was disappointing my team by not being Barbie.”The project moved to Warner Bros. in 2018, with Gerwig taking over and lead actress Robbie producing. Robbie told Vogue that her production company LuckyChap structured the deal with Warner Bros. and Mattel so that screenwriters Gerwig and Baumbach could have an “open” creative process, “which is really fucking hard to do.”For all the details on “Barbie,” click here.",

        "title": "‘Somewhere Quiet’ Review: Jennifer Kim Leads Wannabe ‘Get Out’ That Misunderstands Trauma",
        "content": "“Somewhere Quiet” never has a loud message, and that’s just one of the many misuses of a great concept and haunting cast that plagues the would-be psychological thriller. The feature film, written and directed by Olivia West Lloyd, stars Jennifer Kim as Meg, a woman who recently escaped a kidnapping and is trying to acclimate back to normal life with her husband Scott (Kentucker Adler).Since Scott’s family comes from old money, Meg was held at ransom for months until she managed to flee her kidnappers. Yet Scott’s suggestion for Meg’s relaxation involves bringing her back out into a remote setting, care of his family’s old beach house. Throw in his leering cousin Madeline (a deliciously unhinged Marin Ireland) and Meg is suddenly a third wheel in yet another tense setting.Is she just jumpy or is Scott controlling? Are Madeline’s flirtations with both Scott and Meg fueled by her fetishization of Meg’s Korean heritage? Scott’s family has framed photographs of missionary work in Korea, and Scott keeps sleepwalking over to where the photos are. Meg continues to have nightmares that question Scott’s motives for keeping her isolated, but the racial component is never fully addressed, nor is Meg’s rising paranoia amid her obvious PTSD.Her only interaction with someone outside of Scott’s family is with handyman Joe (Micheál Neeson) who warns her about trespassing on the property, before he realizes that she is in fact married to one of the Whitmans who own most of the surrounding land. However, Meg can’t even trust Joe, as her suspicions as to Madeline’s true identity and Scott’s possible involvement in her kidnapping throw her sense of stability into disarray.Writer-director Lloyd was a production manager on “Shirley,” the Shirley Jackson biopic starring Elizabeth Moss. The indie “do more with less” approach to horror is evident in “Somewhere Quiet,” as Meg starts to find clues that her nightmares are not really dreams at all. Yet, the film doesn’t go deep enough into any of the many compelling themes it presents in the first act, and instead audiences are left with a convenient Lifetime mystery of the week-esque conclusion that too neatly sums up what could have been a haunting portrayal of colonization, delusion, wealth, and the deconstruction of home amidst trauma.“Somewhere Quiet” premiered at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "title": "‘LaRoy’ Review: Steve Zahn Is a Grifting Wannabe Detective in Texas Blackmail Comedy",
        "content": "When Ray Jepsen (John Magaro) pulls into a strip club parking to blow his brains out, his plans for the rest of the week are the furthest thing from his mind. But that’s one of the many, many downsides of suicide that nobody talks about — you create scheduling nightmares for everyone else in your life. And it’s particularly inconvenient when a local sleazebag erroneously believes that he hired you to carry out a murder that must be done tomorrow.But that’s just life in LaRoy, Texas. Shane Atkinson’s feature directorial debut takes place in a fictional town where residents only have three interests: extramarital affairs, blackmailing each other about extramarital affairs, and child beauty pageants. When an obstacle hinders someone’s ability to enjoy those treasured pastimes, murder is the most popular solution.While suicide is never the answer, it’s easy to understand why Ray is so bummed. He’s second-in-command at his family’s hardware store, but his ironically-named older brother Junior (Matthew Del Negro) is determined to undermine his decisions at every turn. The constant belittling has essentially turned him into a powerless hourly employee at a store that bears his name. And while he theoretically owns 50 percent of it, he’s pretty sure that his brother is stealing from the company and cheating him out of most of the profits. Good times.So when his private investigator buddy Skip (Steve Zahn) informs him that his wife is having an affair, he’s determined not to believe it. His marriage to former beauty queen (and current child pageant coach) Stacy-Lynn (Megan Stevenson) is the only thing keeping him going. He tells Skip — a bolo tie-wearing, unlicensed aspiring detective whose meager client list is the laughingstock of the local police department — to let the matter die.But Stacy-Lynn’s disinterest in hiding her affair makes that rather difficult. Her respect for her husband is so low that she has no problem getting dressed up and leaving for the night without even giving him the courtesy of crafting a real excuse. Left without any wins or anyone to share the losses with, Ray decides to buy a gun.His suicide attempt is cut short when a stranger bursts into his truck and hands him an envelope full of cash with an address on it. This man was supposed to meet a hitman in the strip club parking lot, but ends up getting into the wrong car. Ray initially tries to back out of the misunderstanding, but being mistaken for an assassin is the most respect he’s felt in years. He agrees to carry out the hit — if only to feel alive for a few days before he offs himself.The first murder is easy enough, but Ray soon realizes that he has stumbled into a web of infidelity and deception that involves damn-near everyone in LaRoy. His anonymous criminal patron isn’t satisfied with just the killing — he also wants $250,000 that was stashed in the victim’s safe. Ray has no idea where that money is, but he makes plenty of new friends when local creeps and deadbeats begin emerging from the woodwork to demand their cut of it. Suddenly Ray finds himself with a new zest for life and a dozen enemies who want him dead.It becomes clear that the only way out of this mess is to get to the bottom of the blackmail ring that has engulfed the town and find the $250,000 that everyone wants. But Ray’s formerly-depressing existence means he doesn’t have a deep bench of friends to call on for help. He turns to Skip — or more accurately, Skip blackmails Ray into turning to him — and the two incompetent men set out to outsmart the villains pulling the strings in LaRoy.The twisty crime comedy wears its obvious Coen brothers influences on its sleeve, but a hilarious ensemble of larger-than-life characters keeps you so entertained that there’s hardly time to wonder if you’re watching something derivative. The generally solid plot takes a few ridiculous turns that require some suspension of disbelief, but watching Skip and Ray hunt down lust-filled, money-hungry idiots (Brad LeLand’s turn as brash car dealership owner Adam LeDoux is a particular highlight) never gets old.And despite some fun stretches of zany action, Atkinson wisely makes sure his characters never stray too far from the bleak hopelessness that we met them in. Watching “LaRoy” is a lot like the seedy motel affairs that all of its characters seem to be having — two hours of fun, followed by a tragic feeling of emptiness and a desire for a shower.“LaRoy” premiered at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "title": "‘Downtown Owl’ Review: Lily Rabe Turns Anti-Hero in Puzzling Chuck Klosterman Adaptation",
        "content": "When Chuck Klosterman turned his prodigious talents as a pop culture essayist into his first all-fiction project, the 2008 novel “Downtown Owl,” fans of the writer were treated to some classic Klosterman obsessions (North Dakota, sports, the way entertainment shapes us as humans) in a distinctly new shape. The choppy nature of Klosterman’s novel, which focuses on three very different citizens of tiny, fictional Owl, North Dakota, as they navigate small-town life in the lead-up to a massive blizzard, wasn’t as compelling or entertaining as Klosterman’s other books but there was a charm to its flow and feeling. In short: It wasn’t a great Klosterman effort, but it surely was an interesting one.More than a decade after its publication, the long-gestating film adaptation of Klosterman’s novel occupies similar territory: not great, but definitely interesting. And, just like the publication of the novel marked a new point in Klosterman’s career, so too does “Downtown Owl” the film signal a new step in the professional pursuits of co-directors (and longtime partners) Hamish Linklater and Lily Rabe, who both make their directorial debut with this curious dramedy.Rabe also stars in the film (Linklater adapts the script; they both produced), which partially explains why the duo opted to turn Klosterman’s three-hander into a more singularly focused feature, orienting the majority of the story around Rabe’s new-in-town Julia in the months leading up to the January blizzard.It’s a tricky ask: As thrilling as Rabe’s performance eventually becomes, the choice to focus mostly on Julia’s experience and perspective removes much of our investment in Horace (Ed Harris) and Mitch (August Blanco Rosenstein), who were given equal weight in Klosterman’s novel. Still, Rabe’s work here, as a messy, “unlikeable,” and deeply flawed character, is the best part of the film, an anti-hero worth, well, if not cheering for, at least watching with full concentration.Even those unfamiliar with the film’s source material will know how it ends, as Linklater and Rabe open the film with a brief look at the January 1984 blizzard that swoops through Owl, forever impacting the three key characters. Soon, we’re flashing back to September when Julia rolled into Owl, an outsider about to be steeped in this particular brand of small-town life. She’s taken a teaching job at the local high school to get her away from her unseen husband, first chalking up the short-term assignment to work pressures, later making it plain that their relationship is practically dead, and when she’s not drinking herself silly at one of the town’s local bars, she’s showing up hungover and out of it in her history classes.Linklater and Rabe lean on some messy affectations to get their story rolling, including everything from the cute (an unnecessary animated sequence that introduces the town) to the ridiculous (Rabe gliding along the high school hallway in a bizarre double dolly shot; constant use of a fisheye lens in wide shots) to the actually quite good (introductions to Julia’s students, including Mitch, that reveal some serious truths in a winking fashion). Mostly, it just takes a while to settle into itself, to get into a compelling and sensical groove.Then again, that’s also Julia’s experience as she attempts to get hip to Owl life in fits and starts. She’s deluged with new friends and foes, like Vanessa Hudgens as fellow teacher Naomi (an almost unbearably shrill and one-note role that the actress occasionally finds real sparks in), Finn Wittrock as a smooth-talking coach with a secret, Harris as the welcoming older gent Horace, and Henry Golding as former Owl football star Vance Druid. As Julia gets to know the shape of Owl, so too do we — and it’s not always pleasing, as Linklater and Rabe peel off the layers of this particular town with both relish and discomfort. If that sounds awkward, it is.Julia remains the cracked lens through which we view all of this, an unreliable narrator with a skewed sense of, well, just about everything. The kind Horace provides a respite for the addled Julia, heaping on her both home-cooked meals and home-baked gossip, all the better to obscure what’s really happening with his own life. Julia’s sense of propriety is so warped that she can’t recognize how nefarious Coach Laidlaw (Wittrock) really is, nor how his various misdeeds have impacted a close group of sensitive students (including Rosenstein, Jack Dylan Grazer, and Arianna Jaffier). And she sure as hell can’t come to grips with the blooming obsession she feels for Vance, which reduces her to drunk hysterics on the regular. (Late in the film, as Julia sobs that she feels like she’s not done with her 20s — despite pushing 40 — it feels like one of many keys to the story that are dangled and then snatched away.)In short (and in very reductive terms), no one in Owl is well, and the looming blizzard is only the next disaster to befall them. How Linklater and Rabe handle that dark truth can be puzzling, leaning on some characters and situations while leaving others to wither, never quite acknowledging the darkness that plagues this place, and ultimately moving toward a wholly unearned conclusion. Klosterman’s vision of this tiny, insulated world was never this neat and tidy, a lesson that has not translated to its cinematic companion. It’s a slice of life, surely, but a meager one at that.“Downtown Owl” premiered at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival. Sony will release it at a later date.",

        "title": "Linda Hamilton at First Thought Arnold Schwarzenegger Was a ‘Poser’ on ‘The Terminator’ Set",
        "content": "Linda Hamilton is taking back her initial assumption of Arnold Schwarzenegger‘s acting ability on “The Terminator” set.The actress revealed during Netflix’s three-part documentary “Arnold” (via Insider) that she had a “snotty definition” of what it meant to be an actor, one that professional bodybuilder Schwarzenegger didn’t fit into.“By our snotty definition, Arnold was a poser, a bodybuilder pretending to be an actor,” Hamilton said. “But because I was curious, I went and stood off the sidelines watching Arnold, and I bought it. The physicality and the stiffness, and all of the things that he was implementing. I was like, ‘OK, this might work.'”She added that the film was “truly just another job,” and she had no idea it would become a franchise.“I didn’t think that it was particularly greater than over scripts that I’d read. I mean, really clueless,” Hamilton said. “It was very low budget and we were all rather new at it. I definitely had my doubts.”By the time James Cameron’s sequel, “Terminator 2: Judgment Day,” began, Schwarzenegger admitted that Hamilton had outperformed him at the gym.“A few days before we start shooting, Jim Cameron says to me, ‘Let’s all get together and have a nice dinner.’ Linda comes in and she takes her sweater off and I’m looking at her arms,” Schwarzenegger recalled. “Veins on the biceps, and then triceps. Everything was like a bodybuilder but except miniature. I said, ‘I can’t believe that son of a bitch is fucking more cut than me.'”Schwarzenegger previously confirmed that he is done with the “Terminator” films after reuniting with Hamilton in 2019’s “Terminator: Dark Fate.” Schwarzenegger has appeared in six of the franchise installments.“The franchise is not done. I’m done,” Schwarzenegger said. “I got the message loud and clear that the world wants to move on with a different theme when it comes to ‘The Terminator.’ Someone has to come up with a great idea.”He added, “‘The Terminator’ was largely responsible for my success, so I always would look at it very fondly. The first three movies were great. Number four [‘Salvation’] I was not in because I was governor. Then five [‘Genisys’] and six [‘Dark Fate’] didn’t close the deal as far as I’m concerned. We knew that ahead of time because they were just not well-written.”",

        "content": "According to Jeff Goldblum, everything about a Wes Anderson film is extremely specific.The actor says that Anderson was adamant Goldblum did not change even one word of the script during takes on “The Grand Budapest Hotel.”“One thing is that he likes his material to be meticulously rendered,” Goldblum told The Guardian. “In ‘The Grand Budapest Hotel,’ I had a big speech. I had worked on it a lot, and changed a ‘the’ to an ‘and’ or an ‘and’ to a ‘the.’ I didn’t talk to him about it. After a couple of takes, he said, ‘I see that you’re changing that word.’ I said, ‘Yes, it’s not without thought. Here’s my thinking…’ He said, ‘Yes, I understand all that. Please keep it as it is written.'”Goldblum continued, “He’s costumed you, the production design is wonderful, but everything is very specific. He loves actors and he’s very creative. But he’s very particularly Wes Anderson.”The “Asteroid City” actor explained that he was “nervous and excited” on set and was “wanting to do my best and humbled by the opportunity to work with Wes Anderson, with whom I’ve been lucky to do a couple of other things.”As Goldblum summed up, “The talented people are often the ones who are also very down to earth and put you at ease. He is so particular, individual and such a wondrously artful guy, his personality can take over…If Wes Anderson was directing and my character had to fold, cook, read maps and print stuff out, I’d spend extra hours after school, learning!”Anderson recently said that filming “Asteroid City” amid the COVID-19 pandemic benefitted the space alien comedy.“During the intense part of the COVID period, we were writing the script. I don’t think there would be a quarantine in the story if we weren’t experiencing it,” Anderson said. “It wasn’t deliberate. Writing is the most improvisational part of the whole process.”He added, “The making of the movie during COVID protocols, it really suited us. It worked for us. I loved that we formed a troupe and stayed together and sat at a long table and had dinner.”",

        "title": "‘Blue Jean’ Review: Piercing Lesbian Drama Set in Thatcher’s England Resonates Today",
        "content": "As difficult as it can be to look back at less accepting times in queer history, it’s even more painful how relevant it remains. Though “Blue Jean” — an acutely felt lesbian drama set during Margaret Thatcher’s regime — takes place over 30 years ago, 1980’s England could easily stand in for any conservative state today. Set against a backdrop of rising anti-gay sentiment and pending legislation, “Blue Jean” tells a political story through one woman’s strained attempts to straddle two worlds. Featuring a stirring breakout performance from the luminous Rosy McEwan, “Blue Jean” grounds the political with the personal — without losing sight of queer joy.The film opens with a classic image of identity assertion, as puckish Jean (McEwan) bleaches her cropped hair blonde in a mirror. True to its title, she drives a vintage blue compact to school, where her popularity with students stokes jocular envy from her fellow teachers. As the girls’ net ball coach, she keeps an eye out for students with athletic potential, soon noticing coordinated outcast Lois (Lucy Halliday). A loner with curly bangs covering her eyes, Lois is an easy target for bullying, even after she proves her formidable aim.Though Jean keeps to herself at school, she really comes alive at night, where she reigns supreme over the pool table at the local lesbian pub. She has a solid crew of what can best be described as dyke friends, the most pierced leather daddy among them being her girlfriend Viv (Kerrie Hayes). Sporting a shaved head and an impressive array of titty tats, Viv is the epitome of living out, proud, and highly visible. Her studded vest and boisterous moxie no doubt add to her sex appeal, but Jean isn’t always comfortable with how much it gets them noticed in public.The specter of the Conservative party’s Section 28 hangs over Jean’s morning cigarettes, which are punctured by radio reports of a proposed law that would prohibit the “promotion” of homosexuality as a “pretended family relationship.” If the glaring graffiti on her drive to school didn’t herald local sentiment, her colleagues voice their agreement in the teacher’s lounge. “Young people have such vulnerable minds,” says one woman, tsk-tsking her approval of the law. (The focus on minors is especially evocative of today’s attacks on trans youth.)Jean’s unease creeps in slowly in director Georgia Oakley’s restrained slow-build drama, and McEwan translates Jean’s internal simmer with an arsenal of furtive glances, labored chirps, and subtle posture corrections. As she toggles between work and play, home and office, out and closeted, the exhaustion of constant code-switching begins to take a toll. When Jean’s student Lois appears at the bar one night (at her pool table, no less) her carefully sectioned worlds threaten to collide, sending her careening towards a breaking point of self-reckoning.As the tension at school mounts to a boil, “Blue Jean” becomes dangerously reminiscent of “The Children’s Hour,” though Oakley mercifully steers clear of the most tragic outcomes of that lesbian classic. Jean’s internal struggle is more akin to the one in Radclyffe Hall’s “The Well of Loneliness,” which Jean is seen leafing through midway through the film.Though “Blue Jean” has a contemporary sensibility, especially with the colorful low lights of the club and stylish short-haired characters, the story is undeniably steeped in lesbian history. The film combines artfully the legitimate need to show authentic queer life on screen — breathy sex scenes and all — with the vital importance of telling political stories during a time of renewed discrimination.This being 2023, “Blue Jean” finds a defiant finale worthy of charming Jean’s good heart. Oakley is not out to punish her characters or belabor her points for the sake of drama. Though she’s engaging and vivid throughout the film, it’s McEwan’s performance in one late scene that mark her as a star on the rise. Exiting a suffocating party into a world of her own making, she bursts into unbridled laughter that morphs into a deep-throated cry of relief, or maybe grief. Channeling the film’s masterful build-up into a single revelatory moment, her heroic journey is complete.Magnolia Pictures will release “Blue Jean” in select theaters on Friday, June 9.",

        "content": "Rock Hudson’s life as a closeted Hollywood icon is now captured in documentary “Rock Hudson: All That Heaven Allowed.”Helmed by Stephen Kijak (“We Are X,” “Shoplifters of the World”), the HBO film charts the “Giant” heartthrob’s career as an actor of the studio system until his final role in “Dynasty” ahead of his 1985 death from AIDS.Among the most iconic Hollywood men of the 1950s and ’60s, Rock Hudson embodied masculinity and straightness until his diagnosis and death from AIDS in 1985 shattered those notions in the eyes of the public. “Rock Hudson: All That Heaven Allowed” tells the story of Hudson as a man who lived a double life; while his public persona was meticulously curated by his handlers, controlled by the studio system, and falsely anchored by a lavender marriage, Hudson had to keep his homosexuality behind closed doors due to anti-gay sentiments at the time, and because the revelation of which would’ve shattered his career.The documentary features interviews from Hudson’s past partners, colleagues, and close friends. Personal photographs and home videos are also included. “All That Heaven Allowed” is named in reference to Hudson’s breakout role in Douglas Sirk’s “All That Heaven Allows” opposite Jane Wyman.When tabloid rumors about his sexuality began to swirl, his marriage to his manager’s secretary Phyllis Gates briefly put to bed any speculation about his lifestyle. And he was still able to find success in romantic leading roles, including opposite Doris Day in the comedies “Pillow Talk” and “Lover Come Back” before he turned to television in the ‘70s with a successful run on “McMillan and Wife.”Hudson was one of the most popular actors in the world when he was diagnosed with AIDS; his death changed the course of history around the public perception of the disease, and led to Elizabeth Taylor founding amFAR.The documentary is produced by George Chignell, Will Clarke, Carolyne Jurriaans, Greg Berlanti, and Sarah Schechter.“Rock Hudson: All That Heaven Allowed” premieres on HBO and Max June 28.

        "title": "A New Academy Museum Podcast Revels in Hollywood Casting Coups and Untapped Trivia",
        "content": "Casting is one of the hidden arts of Hollywood, and starting June 15, the second season of The Academy Museum Podcast, “Close Up on Casting,” hosted by the Museum’s Director and President Jacqueline Stewart, delves into often misunderstood art and influence of Hollywood casting.The audio series draws inspiration from the museum’s galleries, Stewart said during a recent small press gathering and podcast preview for the episode centered on the Hitchcock film “Rebecca.” She saw that her curators had more research and intel to share than was possible to display in the audience-favorite Performance Gallery, packed with early Polaroids of actors, audition tapes, and casting directors’ notes, which deserves to be expanded. The typewritten list of actresses considered for producer David O. Selznick’s production of “Rebecca” (1940), for example, is priceless, with often snarky and misogynist descriptions by each name.“It was really interesting to watch visitors imagine different possibilities for some of their favorite films,” Stewart said in the podcast intro. “There’s an essential casting story behind every Oscar winner, and we’ll be shedding light on the history of this profession. We’ll be working our way from the classic Hollywood studio era to today. And with every film and story, we’ll be asking who gets the part? How does that choice get made? And what does it mean for a film for an actor and for audiences? You’ll hear from directors Academy museum curators, film historians, producers, and of course casting directors.”Produced by Laist Studios, the ten episodes include interviews with casting directors and scholars, including Sarah Finn, Eric Goldberg, Kimberly Hardin, Mary Hidalgo, Lora Kennedy, Laurie Parker, and David Rubin, as well as usually inaccessible archival audio. “It’s been an incredible opportunity to talk to casting directors and people who work with them to learn more about the history of that discipline, that profession, which has been marginalized and underappreciated,” said Stewart. “It’s not the job we normally think about, even though so instrumental in the things that we love most about films, like the interactions between the actors.”On the first Season 2 podcast on “Rebecca,” we learn that when star Laurence Olivier’s partner, “Gone with Wind” star Vivien Leigh, didn’t make the cut as Maxim de Winter’s new wife, he treated the actress who landed the role, Joan Fontaine, with chilly condescension. “He and many of the other actors thought that she didn’t have it in her,” historian Patricia White told Stewart. “That made the experience of acting for this pretty inexperienced young woman fairly difficult on set.”This only served to enhance her performance as a shy interloper. “We’re not really sure as viewers what he thinks of of her, or even why he married her,” said Stewart. Fontaine scored an Oscar nomination for Best Actress, and the movie won Best Picture.While Stewart was preparing the podcast, she learned about how the studio system worked before the arrival of casting directors. “I knew that there was this powerbrokering that happened in the studios, when these big personality men were in charge of things,” she said. “I didn’t realize just how disdainful they could be of the women involved. And that this was a way in which the artistic possibilities not just for the women, but also for male actors as well were circumscribed by the factory system that was Hollywood at that time.”This helps to explain the rebellion of an actress like Olivia de Havilland, who sued the studio over the ways in which her career was unfairly controlled by restrictive contracts. “The evolution of casting as a profession has meant that there have been more nuanced and sensitive ways to think about the possibilities for for women, for sure,” said Stewart. “It’s not perfect, but it’s a major transformational process over time.”The fracas over the casting of a Black actress in the live-action “The Little Mermaid” inspired Stewart and her podcast team to “think a lot about how casting can help people imagine all kinds of different possibilities,” she said. “And it’s a very powerful tool. It can limit, like: I can’t be a doctor, I can’t be a mermaid. Or: I can write, I can be president, or someone who looks like me can do X, Y, or Z. So those are some of the issues we definitely talk about with the contemporary casting directors.”Among the other stories that will be featured in the 10-episode season is “Typecasting and the Studio System: The Case of Noble Johnson,” who was “the first Black movie star,” said Stewart. “He played a wide variety of racial roles, because he had a look that could basically play any person of color. And Hollywood had a way of doing that with actors during that time. But he also founded an independent Black film company called the Lincoln Motion Picture Company. So he was making these independent Black cast films on the side. And he was doing work on westerns for Universal on the other side.”One episode looks at casting unknowns. Casting director Kimberly Hardin worked with John Singleton on “Boyz ‘n the Hood.” “She brought us Tyrese, for example,” said Stewart. “Kim Coleman, another important casting director, talks about the actual practice of chasing people down at the mall. What does it take to be able to spot that kind of talent? How do you develop that kind of skill over time?”An episode on casting animated films such as “Aladdin” and “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” delves into “the qualities of voice acting and animation acting and why stand up comedians can do really well,” said Stewart, “and choosing someone who’s going to be relevant two or three years later, because the production process takes so long for animation.”Finally, casting is about advocacy. “The casting directors talk about bringing people that the directors would not have normally thought about,” said Stewart. “They sometimes go into the mat for talent that they feel very strongly about that would never get in the door unless they were doing that advocacy work.”The first season of the podcast, “And the Oscar Goes to…,” went behind the scenes of several Academy Awards ceremonies, including “The Brave One,” which explored the history of campaigning for Oscars during the blacklist, “and how so many film professionals couldn’t use their own names,” said Stewart. “Even when they won Oscars, like Dalton Trumbo.” And Halle Berry looked back on her historic Best Actress Oscar win. “She reflected on what that didn’t mean for her career,” said Stewart. “It did not mean that, as she put it, a script truck started dumping things off at her house. That did not happen.”Listeners can find the ten-episode series on the Academy Museum and LAist Studios websites, as well as on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and other podcast platforms.",

        "title": "‘Indiana Jones’ Producer Frank Marshall on the WGA Strike: ‘We Have to Figure Out a New Formula’",
        "content": "While much of Hollywood endures a forced vacation due to strike-related shutdowns, Frank Marshall has a different way to stay busy. Over the past three years, the producer best known for overseeing the “Indiana Jones” franchise with his wife Kathleen Kennedy has moonlighted as a documentary filmmaker. “I’m lucky that as long as I break even I’m happy,” Marshall said during a recent interview with IndieWire. “I really love the excitement and freedom that documentary filmmaking brings.”Now, a few weeks after journeying to Cannes for the premiere of “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” Marshall arrives at the Tribeca Festival to premiere “Rather,” an affectionate portrait of 92-year-old news anchor Dan Rather. He has one feature in production, the “Twister” sequel “Twisters,” which is halfway done (“they have a script,” he said), but other announced projects like “Spinal Tap II” have been put on hold. So Marshall is already deep into editing yet another documentary, this one focused on The Beach Boys. “I have no idea how long this will go on,” he said. “When it’s a doc, it doesn’t affect me.” Still, the strike has given much for Marshall and Kennedy to consider about the future. When asked about the WGA’s demands at a Cannes press conference for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” Marshall ceded to Kennedy, who was seated by his side. “I would like to see the whole situation resolved by truly being in an environment where people can talk about what are some really complicated issues right now that are affecting the entire industry,” she said. “You can’t do any of this without great writing. … I am in full support — I know most people are in full support — of the writers getting what they deserve.” Now, with the DGA avoiding a strike by agreeing to a new three-year deal with studios and SAG voting for strike authorization if it doesn’t reach a new deal by the end of the month, the situation has grown more complicated. “We have to figure out a new formula,” Marshall said. “There are new things that we have to deal with. I was encouraged by the DGA working things out and I hope this leads to both WGA and SAG coming to terms with the producers. We need to be fair to both sides. Both sides have points and they need to work that out.” It just so happens that the new “Indiana Jones” movie reflects one ongoing concern for the guilds, as the movie makes extensive use of A.I. to reconstruct Harrison Ford’s face and present an earlier version of the character who resembles his appearance in the movies they produced four decades ago. “You can’t just say ‘no A.I.,’” Marshall said. That’s why these discussions have to go on. We have to figure that out.” With “Indiana Jones,” Lucasfilm drew on decades of Ford footage to de-age its lead. “That’s a great tool,” Marshall said. “But it’s not something we’re going to use all the time. It just doesn’t do it all the time.” While actors fear that A.I. could be used to exploit their likeness indefinitely, Marshall wasn’t convinced. “The key with Harrison was that we had so much reference when he was at that age, and we have him, so it’s a different issue actor to actor,” he said. “They have to come up with some sort of compromise that makes sense for everybody.”Meanwhile, the WGA has insisted on a deal with the AMPTP that would bar studios from having writers adapt A.I.-generated ideas unless the writers received original writing credit. For now, Marshall said, the technology didn’t seem like a major threat to the writing process. “It’s not the answer, it’s a tool,” he said. “I don’t use it. We have to write from up here. People write about feelings. AI doesn’t have feelings, emotion, humor, all those things.”Like most of Hollywood, Marshall is no stranger to production shutdowns. “Jurassic World: Dominion” was the first major studio project to complete its production with its cast and crew under living under quarantine (a situation that inspired Judd Apatow’s Netflix comedy “The Bubble”). Then came “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” shot throughout the second half of 2021 and into early 2022, as the pandemic continued to complicate plans. “It was not as much fun as it was on the other four movies, but we made it through,” Marshall said.At Cannes, Ford received a lifetime achievement tribute that doubled as a send-off to his most famous creation. “It was surprisingly emotional,” Marshall said. “When you really think about it, we’ve been a family for over 40 years.” Marshall’s own entry into the film business goes back much farther than that, as he was enlisted to work on Peter Bogdonavich’s 1968 debut “Targets” after encountering the filmmaker at a birthday party for John Ford’s daughter. Now, at the age of 76, Marshall looks back on that journey through the Hollywood of the 1970s and 1980s with some measure of nostalgia.“Back then, the studios all had their own identity,” he said. “When we were making picture at Warner Bros., or Universal, or Paramount, or MGM, who was running it and what they were looking for. Now it’s kind of a gumbo where they all want a franchise but they’re a tiny piece of that corporation. Does it go to streaming? Does it go to theaters? There are so many pressures on young filmmakers.”He saw one silver lining though. “You couldn’t make a movie on your phone then,” he said. “The good news is that there are so many more outlets for film. So make a good story, write a good script, it still boils down to that. The talent will rise. The entry point is just different.”Marshall said he felt a certain kinship with Rather, the subject of his latest documentary, as the newsman navigated the growing commercial demands of the TV space through several eras. The movie follows Rather from his breakthrough moment covering Hurricane Carla for Houston’s local CBS affiliate in 1961 all the way through his current status as a social media celebrity. “We all know what that corporate pressure is like,” Marshall said. “It’s ratings, it’s eyeballs, clicks, and data.” As the documentary points out, Rather’s irascible persona has transitioned well into the social media age, as his Twitter account has amassed close to 3 million followers. However, his earlier career hit an unceremonious endpoint after the reporting on a story about George W. Bush’s military record was called into question during the 2004 presidential campaign. He was fired by the network two years later. (Marshall hasn’t seen “Truth,” the 2015 dramatization of these circumstances that starred Robert Redford as Rather.) “The story was true as far as I can tell,” Marshall said. “I do feel that he looks back and thinks he might’ve done things differently then. He was not reluctant at all to talk about it. I think it’s a good thing that we all make mistakes.” Marshall wasn’t sure if Rather’s particular brand of muckraking journalism and no-nonsense tone could survive in the current era of cable news. “We still need people who have principles, integrity, and believe in telling the truth,” he said. “The world has changed for all of us on the entertainment side. The studios are all owned by these big conglomerates. When those things started to change, when it was all about making money.” He smiled, then added: “That’s a whole other documentary.” “Rather” will have its world premiere at the 2023 Tribeca Festival.",

        "title": "‘Poor Things’ Trailer: Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone Are Reborn in a Frankenstein Fantasy",
        "content": "Lovers of Yorgos Lanthimos are poor things no more, as the full trailer for his first feature in five years has debuted.“Poor Things” opens September 8 from Searchlight Pictures and stars Emma Stone, who earned an Oscar nomination for 2018’s “The Favourite,” Lanthimos’ dark period piece written by Tony McNamara, who returns again to pen this visually sumptuous twist on the Frankenstein story.The film centers on the incredible tale and fantastical evolution of Bella Baxter (Stone), a young woman brought back to life by the brilliant and unorthodox scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe). Under Baxter’s protection, Bella is eager to learn. Hungry for the worldliness she is lacking, Bella runs off with Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), a slick and debauched lawyer, on a whirlwind adventure across the continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella grows steadfast in her purpose to stand for equality and liberation.The cast also includes recent “Sanctuary” stars Christopher Abbott and Margaret Qualley, “The Tragedy of Macbeth” breakout Kathryn Hunter, plus comedians Jerrod Carmichael and Rammy Youssef. Given the film’s September — and awards-friendly — release date, expect “Poor Things” to show up at this year’s Venice Film Festival.“Poor Things” is based on Scottish author Alasdair Gray’s postmodern 1992 novel about a woman who drowns herself to escape her abusive husband and is resurrected with the brain of her unborn child. Star Abbott recently had high praises for the film: “First of all, the set design was incredible. You can see in the teaser how wild it looks, and while it didn’t look exactly like that, I was sort of amazed by how magical the actual sets felt and how detailed they were. When I saw the teaser as well, it was even more vivid and wild than it felt on set. So it just sort of doubled itself, and it looks incredible,” he said.Lanthimos has been nominated for three Oscars: Best Picture and Best Director for “The Favourite,” and Best Original Screenplay for “The Lobster.” The Greek filmmaker was notably shunned from the 2010 Best International Feature Oscar race for his dystopian drama “Dogtooth.”Watch the trailer for “Poor Things” below.",

        "title": "Sebastián Silva’s Queer Dark Comedy ‘Rotting in the Sun’ Acquired by MUBI After Sundance Premiere (Exclusive)",
        "content": "Sebastián Silva’s Mexico-set meta-comedy “Rotting in the Sun” has finally found a home in the U.S. and elsewhere after premiering at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2023.IndieWire exclusively shares that MUBI has acquired the rights to the latest button-pushing work from the filmmaker behind “The Maid,” “Nasty Baby,” and “Crystal Fairy.” The Park City premiere stars Silva as a version of himself, here a filmmaker staring down an existential crisis while adrift over his busted latest project, and comedian and social media sensation Jordan Firstman also as a version of himself, an outspokenly gay influencer who blows up the fictional Silva’s life.This raunchy, sexually explicit satire of gay millennial life amused and provoked Sundance audiences with its graphic content, unapologetic drug use, and a narrative hairpin turn typical of Silva’s low-budget, genre-mixing indies. In a quote shared by MUBI, Bret Easton Ellis said the film is “like if Alfonso Cuarón’s ‘Roma’ were made by ‘Female Trouble’-era John Waters.”The Chilean filmmaker based “Rotting in the Sun” on his own experience vacating Brooklyn for Mexico City, where he lived in an architectural studio hoping to restart his career as a painter. “I just wanted to paint and chill,” Silva told IndieWire in an interview out of Sundance. “But I can’t escape the movies. Wherever I go, I see things that are cinematic.”It was there he met social media star Jordan Firstman at the Plaza Rio de Janeiro, where Firstman told him he’d just rewatched “Crystal Fairy” the night before. The encounter makes it into “Rotting in the Sun,” though reset on a nude beach and after Silva’s character tries to drown himself. In the film, the pair start up a collaboration, only for Silva to go missing, setting Firstman on a quasi-detective journey to find him. Meanwhile, Silva’s housekeeper (“The Maid” star Catalina Saavedra) may have something to do with his disappearance — though “Rotting” has plenty more Ketamine-addled tricks in its arsenal.“I found him hilarious and exhausting,” Silva said of meeting Firstman, who’s had roles in series including “Search Party” and “Ms. Marvel” and also works as a TV writer. “It was very much something I wanted to make fun of.”MUBI acquired rights for “Rotting in the Sun” in North America, Latin America, UK/Ireland, Germany/Austria, France, Benelux, Italy, and Spain. The film will open theatrically in the U.S. on September 8 and stream on MUBI globally September 15.“Rotting in the Sun,” produced by Jacob Wasserman, Hidden Content, and The Lift, in association with Robert Pattinson’s production company Icki Eneo Arlo, Spacemaker Productions and Caffeine Post, marked Silva’s fifth time back at Sundance, where he’s previously won the World Cinema Grand Jury Prize and Directing Award.Check out an exclusive clip from the film below.",

        "title": "Maïwenn’s ‘Jeanne Du Barry’ with Johnny Depp Lands North American Release from Vertical",
        "content": "“Jeanne Du Barry,” the latest film from French director Maïwenn that stars Johnny Depp, has found a North American distributor in Vertical following its Cannes debut, an individual with knowledge told IndieWire.“Jeanne Du Barry” was the opening night film at the Cannes Film Festival last month, where it received a 7-minute standing ovation from the crowd in the Palais. But it was a controversial choice because of Depp’s continued career rehab following the highly publicized defamation trial between him and ex-wife Amber Heard, but also because of a report against Maïwenn that accused her of assaulting a journalist, an accusation she later admitted to.The film stars Depp as the French King Louis XV in a supporting role and primarily follows Maïwenn as Jeanne Vaubernier, an 18th Century French working class woman who became King Louis XV’s lover. Here’s the full synopsis:“Jeanne du Barry” follows Jeanne Vaubernier (Maïwenn), a working-class woman determined to climb the social ladder, using her charms to escape her impoverished life.  Her lover, the Comte du Barry (Poupaud), wishes to present her to King Louis XV (Depp) and orchestrates a meeting through the influential Duke of Richelieu (Richard). The encounter goes far beyond his expectations for it was love at first sight for the King and Jeanne. Through this ravishing courtesan, the king rediscovers his appetite for life and feels he can no longer live without her. Making Jeanne his last official mistress, scandal erupts as no one at Court will accept a girl from the streets into their rarified world.No specific release plans were unveiled along with the acquisition, and while the film might get a small theatrical release, Vertical will most likely give the film a VOD play. The distributor also picked up a package for an Emma Roberts comedy called “Hot Mess” out of the Marché du Film.Maïwenn also co-wrote, directed and produced the critically acclaimed film which also stars well-known French actors Benjamin Lavernhe, Pierre Richard, Melvil Poupaud, and Pascal Greggory. The co-writers are Teddy Lussi-Modeste and Nicolas Livecchi and the film’s producers are Pascal Caucheteux and Grégoire Sorlat.Already the film has performed strongly at the French box office, bringing in $4.1 million over two weeks, and Netflix even has the French rights after its theatrical run. But a North American sale seemed less certain given Depp’s recent woes with Hollywood.IndieWire’s review out of Cannes said that despite Depp’s star power, the film is largely an acting showcase for Maïwenn, “for better or for worse.”“To call the style ‘self-infatuated’ is less a criticism than a simple statement of fact,” IndieWire’s Ben Croll wrote. “The auteur promises director and muse wrapped in one, with a voice louder and angrier than that of anyone else; when not on screen, all the other characters tend to ask, Where’s Maïwenn?”While this acquisition for “Jeanne du Barry” might not represent a career comeback for Depp, even if Hollywood appears ready for it, the star at the film’s press conference was asked about whether he felt “boycotted” by Hollywood and said he didn’t feel inclined to begin his comeback tour.“Did I feel a boycott by Hollywood? Well, you’d have to not have a pulse to feel at that point, ‘None of this is happening, it’s just a weird joke or I have been asleep for 35 years,’” Depp said during the Cannes press conference. “Of course, when you’re asked to resign from a film you’re doing, because of something that is merely a bunch of kind of vowels and consonants floating in the air, you feel a boycott.”The production companies are Why Not Productions, France 2 Cinéma, France 3 Cinéma, La Petite Reine, Impala Productions, Les Films de Batna, In.2 Film, and Les Films du Fleuve. Rounding out the below the line talent is cinematographer Laurent Dailland, editor Laure Gardette, production designer Angelo Zamparutti, costume designer Jürgen Doering, and composer Stephen Warbeck.“‘Jeanne du Barry’ was by far the most talked about film at this year’s Cannes Film Festival and we are thrilled to have come out on top of the competitive bidding war for the domestic rights to Maïwenn’s [visually] stunning piece of cinematic art showcasing Johnny Depp’s return to the big screen,” Vertical Partner Peter Jarowey said in a statement. “With Johnny’s huge appeal, we feel moviegoers that may not typically seek out foreign films just might turn out for this one.”CAA Media Finance and Goodfellas jointly handled the North American sale. Jarowey and Senior Vice President of Acquisitions Tony Piantedosi negotiated the deal on behalf of Vertical.Variety first reported the news of the film’s North American sale.",

        "content": "San Francisco microbudget filmmaker H.P Mendoza is bringing his Bay Area sensibilities to Tribeca.The filmmaker best known for “Colma: The Musical” about the small town in San Mateo County, California is now turning his camera on a subject less musical but still as likely to become weirdly contagious: the pursuit of self-help. “The Secret Art of Human Flight” premieres at the Tribeca Festival this month, and IndieWire below shares the exclusive first trailer of the movie.The cast includes Paul Raci, Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 2021 for his starring role in “Sound of Metal,” and he’s joined by cast members including Grant Rosenmeyer, Lucy DeVito, Nican Robinson, Reina Hardesty, Maggie Grace, and Sendhil Ramamurthy.Mendoza directs the film from a screenplay by Jesse Orenshein. Mendoza shot the film with “I Think You Should Leave” cinematographer Markus Mentzer.Per the festival synopsis, “After the sudden and tragic loss of his wife, Ben (Grant Rosenmeyer) turns to a mysterious self-help book that will train him to learn how to fly. Or at least he hopes, as he turns his life upside down under the advisement of an eccentric spiritual guide (Paul Raci) who may very well be a con artist. Fending off his worried sister and an ambitious detective who is convinced he killed his wife, Ben risks it all to fly in an effort to get through his grief. Writer-director H.P. Mendoza deftly walks the line between absurdity and the seriousness of loss and grief. This endearing story has the perfect dose of melancholy and poignancy with a ton of laughs. Raci, in particular, is a hilarious delight as a guide with a shady past. An altogether delightful, whimsical film and a great tale of grief and healing.”As IndieWire wrote previously, “Mendoza’s best work blends quirkiness and unexpected twists with an undercurrent of melancholy, and this one seems likely to keep that welcome tradition alive.”The film will have its world premiere at the Tribeca Festival on June 8 in the U.S. Narrative Competition. XYZ Films is handling sales.",

        "title": "The Odds of an Actors Strike: SAG-AFTRA Negotiations, Explained",
        "content": "The strike remains a hot-button conversation, but the topic has changed. The writers are a given and the directors made a deal; today, it’s all about the actors.The Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) begins contract negotiations June 7; its contract expires June 30. If SAG-AFTRA joined the writers on strike, it would mean a near-total shutdown of the industry.SAG took the rare step of calling for a strike authorization vote and goes into the talks with of 97.91 percent of its members willing to go on strike if a fair deal isn’t reached.“We’re really at an inflection point in the industry,” SAG-AFTRA chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland told IndieWire. “There are some issues that are really time sensitive and of crucial importance perhaps in ways that aren’t always the case. It’s an important moment for the labor movement in the entertainment industry and in the broader economy in this country. Our members are energized and feeling empowered in ways they haven’t in the past. That’s in part due to the extraordinary solidarity that we’ve seen with other industry unions, writers and directors of course, but also Teamsters, the basic crafts and others.”Like the writers strike before it, we figured you might have some questions.The last (and only) time that actors went on strike against the major studios was three months and three days in 1980, lasting from July until mid-October. The work stoppage against the TV networks and studios included NBC, CBS, and ABC, and film studios Paramount, 20th Century Fox, and Universal. Actors also boycotted the Emmys; only one of the 52 acting nominees, Powers Boothe, appeared. Film and TV production was shut down, with the exception of some game shows, soap operas, educational programs like Carl Sagan’s “Cosmos: A Personal Voyage.” Hollywood lost millions each week.One of the key 1980 issues was residuals tied to VHS releases. (Only two percent of households even had a VCR.) Actors wanted 12 percent of gross revenue on home releases; studios gave 4.5 percent, but with overall pay raises of 32.5 percent.Beyond that, the guild struck against global advertising firm Bartle Bogle Hegarty back in 2018; that lasted 10 months. The longest strike in the guild’s history was 11 months between 2016-2017 in a fight with 11 major video game publishers.When SAG and AFTRA (American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) were separate unions back in 2000, the two joined forces and went on strike for a new commercial contract. Advertising firms wanted to roll back residual payments for commercials on network TV to match how actors’ flat-fee payments for cable ads. Actors got a significant pay bump and some wins in the still-nascent Internet advertising space, but failed to get cable residuals. That six-month labor action is considered one of the larger, more costly strikes in American history.The negotiations that begin this week would affect SAG’s entire membership of over 160,000 individuals and the guild would fight with the studios on issues they believe speak to economic inequality and workers’ rights.SAG members have joined writers on the picket lines to demonstrate their solidarity. While the DGA deal may suggest the studios’ thinking, negotiators are unlikely to feel bound by their terms. The actors’ guild has also made clear, as did the WGA, that the DGA’s tentative deal will not impact their own negotiating agenda.The lack of clarity about the SAG negotiations means indie film productions are struggling to obtain insurance necessary to start productions, as IndieWire recently reported. Others have preemptively pushed back their start dates until the fall and are planning for the worst while hoping for the best.Despite some faux-pas commentary by SAG president Fran Drescher, the DGA, SAG, and WGA have much in common on a few key issues: higher minimums, streaming residuals, AI, and data transparency.Like writers and directors, actors believe that residuals should provide a “meaningful share of the economic value” of their performances. All guilds believe the formula for calculating streaming residuals, especially for how these shows are viewed globally, needs to improve.Like the writers (and directors), actors want data transparency so they can benefit from streaming successes. Also like writers, actors are in a position where fewer episodes of TV and longer breaks between seasons mean relying on residuals to sustain them during extended gaps in jobs.The DGA in its tentative deal made progress on that front; in theory, the WGA and SAG can build upon it. However, even the DGA’s deal does not match inflation rates — especially for the many SAG-AFTRA members who work at scale.The DGA won important language stating that AI cannot be considered a “person” or replace the work done by members. For actors, companies are already using sophisticated digital models of actors, replicating their likenesses and voices for projects. Other guilds don’t address how AI deepfakes can be a potential abuse of performers.SAG will focus on ensuring actors must give informed consent about using their likeness and that they’re paid appropriately for doing so. It also will ask questions about training AI data sets on actors’ performances; no one wants to be replaced with a completely synthesized performance. SAG-AFTRA already has contract language for AI when it comes to commercial performers or for low-budget productions.As Crabtree-Ireland wrote in a guest blog for Variety on AI, SAG-AFTRA’s position is companies must go through the union to negotiate terms to use an actor’s likeness in any way.“What’s important to understand is that SAG-AFTRA is not fighting to ban the use of AI,” he wrote. “Whether on screen, in music or video games, or any of the other areas we cover, the technology opens up new creative possibilities, but it cannot come at the expense of people.”The actors have a unique concern in self-taped auditions, aka self-tapes. The guild says self-taped auditions, which became commonplace during the pandemic, are “unregulated and out of control” and put a costly burden on actors in the audition process.No one wants to get rid of self-taping altogether, which have been great for accessibility. They broaden opportunities for underrepresented groups and people around the world who might not otherwise get a shot to audition in-person. So the guild isn’t looking to put the genie back in the bottle and ban them.For actors, self-taping means they don’t receive real-time feedback — but beyond that, the demands can go out of control. They’re asked to film themselves from multiple angles, or while driving, or climbing on furniture. In some cases, auditions verge on becoming full-blown productions that may demand camera purchases, lighting, and an editor.At least in one instance, a casting office was royally called out for offering to help actors with their self-tapes by charging them a fee to film in its studio space. Other businesses have sprung up around this trend and SAG wants to reel it in.Not everyone is thrilled that the DGA cut its own deal while the writers are striking, but getting the AMPTP on the record on AI, residuals, and establishing higher minimum pay lets other guilds focus more on other issues.If negotiations don’t go well for SAG, virtually all production will shut down. TV seasons and release dates for movies will push back. If no one knows when production might start, the market will come to a crawl. The Emmys will almost certainly be in jeopardy, and streamers and networks will start feeling the pinch on a lack of content. No one wants that, but there’s also a sense that it might be worth it. “There’s a sense that workers are stepping up now and saying, ‘Hey, we’re not going to let these big corporations run roughshod over us,” Crabtree-Ireland told IndieWire. “We’re going to stand up for ourselves and people in this country are going to support us doing that because it’s how everyone feels. There’s an economic inequality issue in this country in general that people are recognizing, there is a problem with excessive corporate power that people are recognizing. And I think we find ourselves at a moment where we can really do something about that, and we intend to.” ",

        "title": "Why an Ad for ‘The Kardashians’ Ran Ahead of ‘The Little Mermaid’",
        "content": "Families with young children were in recline inside the suburban New Jersey Cinemark for an opening-weekend matinee screening of Disney’s live-action “The Little Mermaid” remake. That’s when it rolled: an ad for Hulu reality series “The Kardashians.” Cue the mom groans.This dad of two, ages 3 and 6, didn’t groan outwardly; I braced for impact. And then it came in the form of a loud whisper: “I like them,” said my 6-year-old, who definitely does not know who Kim Kardashian and the gang are. But of course she would like them — she’s very into Barbie dolls.The jarring moment was saved by Cinderella’s Castle and not spoken of again. But one of us couldn’t stop thinking about it. Why would an ad for “The Kardashians,” even a pretty innocuous one, run ahead of the animated-movie trailers that ran ahead of the kiddie feature presentation? My first instinct was corporate synergy gone wild, as “The Little Mermaid” and Hulu share a parent company in Disney. But as Mike Rosen, chief revenue officer of National CineMedia told me, that had nothing to do with it.He would know: NCM books most of the pre-movie advertisements, including this one for “The Kardashians” inside Cinemark locations, in the U.S. At a minimum, humans inside NCM cleared the footage for the “PG” audience; NCM’s proprietary algorithm, with software meant to guarantee X number of ad impressions, did the rest.“Every commercial gets vetted,” Rosen said. The key question is whether the commercial message is appropriate for the audience. For example, commercials for beer, wine, and spirits can only be rolled if 72 percent of the intended audience is 21 or older. (That’s referred to as “LDA-compliant” — LDA stands for legal drinking age.)It’s “exactly the same as television standards,” Rosen said. “Obviously, ‘The Kardashians’ is intended for the parents, not necessarily the kids.”The content was fine. For this parent, who is definitely not the Kardashians demo (but bring on the LDA stuff!), the most memorable moment had Kim asking sister Kourtney to “walk ahead” to ensure the Hulu cameras were getting a “solo shot” of her. Because otherwise we’d be hurting for footage of Kim Kardashian.If you don’t know NCM, you may know its pre-movie show, “Noovie.” Hosted by Maria Menounos, “Noovie” runs trivia, A/R gaming, critics picks, and yes, ads, for 20-25 minutes (depending on exhibitor) ahead of what the industry calls “lights down.” That’s when the theater takes over the screen — usually with a beverage spot, an ad for the particular theater-franchise’s loyalty program, and between four and eight trailers. In certain theaters, NCM books another four- or five-minute advertising pod ahead of the Coke or Pepsi advertisement. That’s primetime.Rosen knows primetime — and the Kardashians (or at least, “The Kardashians”) — quite well. Rosen was an executive VP in NBCUniversal’s ad-sales department for a half-dozen of the 15 years that “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” aired on its E! cable channel. And on TV, much like a “PG” showtime in a movie theater, the general industry consensus is: “Yes, there might be kids in the room,” Rosen said, but while certain ads may not be intended for the littles, standards and practices ensures the commercials are always deemed appropriate for them.The audience is just more captive in a movie theater, which is why mine even noticed the promo. It’s also why advertising there can be so effective: NCM’s prime real estate, the silver screen, practically sells itself in the business of attention.We asked NCM for statistics about how many”The Little Mermaid” screenings that weekend had the “Kardashians” spot in their pre-rolls, though we did not receive a response to that query. Chances are, our experience was not the majority’s experience. Perhaps you got LEGO or Nintendo ads; those are two big NCM clients that, on occasion, only want their spots on “G” or “PG” movies. We would have happily taken either.",

        "title": "10 LGBTQ Film and TV Creators on the Rise in 2023",
        "content": "As LGBTQ characters and stories become the norm — mercifully, no longer an outlier or cause for surprise — it’s more important than ever to check your sources.Just as you study the labels on your food or the sustainability of your clothing, audiences should be informed as to who is behind the camera (and pages) when it comes to queer stories. While we’d never dictate what stories creators are allowed to write, the proof is often in the pudding when it comes to queer film and TV. As proven by the diabolical gay delights of “The White Lotus” or the lustfully longing glances in “A Portrait of a Lady on Fire,” it just hits different when we’re in charge.  In an industry that often purports to celebrate difference until it comes to who gets the big bucks, LGBTQ talent often have to work twice as hard to get half as far in Hollywood. Trace Lysette served as an executive producer on her new film “Monica,” which took over six years to secure funding despite having Patricia Clarkson attached. On the TV side, even when queer-led projects earn critical acclaim and dedicated followings, it’s rare to get more than two seasons. “Work in Progress,” “Los Espookys,” and “A League of Their Own” are recent examples of beloved queer series that were canceled too soon. When it comes to directing and showrunning, mentorship is the main way emerging talent can gain experience on film and TV sets. As the recent WGA strike put forth as one of the union’s many talking points, opportunities for learning on the job are falling by the wayside in the new system. For marginalized creators who may be shut out from other ways in the door, this discrepancy is felt exponentially. Although demand for LGBTQ content is rising, there seem to be fewer paths to success for queer creators than ever. With such narrow margins, every success deserves major recognition.In the spirit of being in the know, it’s important to highlight and celebrate the queer filmmakers, writers, and creators who are setting — and raising — the bar for queer storytelling. Whether they’ve been household names for awhile or are just beginning to make their presence felt, here are ten LGBTQ creators on the rise in June 2023.To quote one of the greatest semi-queer TV shows of all time, “The Wire,” the queen stays the queen. But unlike those born into royalty, Zackary Drucker has been hustling hard for her crown. She’s been a mover and shaker since her days as a producer on “Transparent,” and she really stepped into her own in 2021 as co-director of the riveting HBO docuseries “The Lady and The Dale.” This year, she really took her rightful place center stage to direct the Hulu series “Queenmaker: The Making of an It Girl.” She also co-directed (with Kristen Lovell) “The Stroll,” a long overdue documentary about the history of trans sex workers in New York’s Meatpacking District. Drucker is the definition of putting in the work, and it’s high time she gets her flowers.  Whatever image is conjured up by the phrase “feminist horror,” Stewart Thorndike’s films cannot be defined by such a tidy catchphrase. Wholly original and deeply rooted in genre film history, her films use horror tropes to probe the darker sides of motherhood, relationships, and emotional interiority. Her 2014 feature “Lyle” starred Gaby Hoffmann as a mother grieving her toddler, earning indie film street cred for its queer twist on “Rosemary’s Baby.” She’ll soon follow that up with the queer ensemble thriller “Bad Things”: Thorndike’s take on “The Shining,” which stars the powerhouse “GLOW” star Gayle Rankin as an even messier Jack Torrance.  One of the youngest filmmakers on this list, Luis De Filippis is just getting started. A Canadian filmmaker of Italian descent, her debut feature “Something You Said Last Night” is a sharply observed family dramedy that just so happens to have a trans lead. Featuring a standout comedic performance by Ramona Milano (“Degrassi: The Next Generation”) as an overly supportive mother, the film follows a directionless twenty-something trans girl named Renata (Carmen Madonia) over one week of family vacation. Sensitively rendered and elegantly charming, the strong debut marks De Filippis as a talent to watch.  After a rockstar launch in 2017 with “Susanne Bartsch: On Top,” a fabulously reverent documentary about New York City’s hardest-working nightlife icon, Anthony Caronna proved themself a master of making vital queer history feel contemporary and fresh. That impressive debut caught the eye of revered indie production company Killer Films, which tapped them to direct the 1980s episode of the FX docuseries “Pride” in 2021. Caronna will take full control this summer with “Last Call,” a true-crime docuseries for HBO about a string of murders that haunted New York’s queer community in the 1990s. Though he’s already firmly established in Europe as an award-winning narrative and documentary filmmaker, French director and screenwriter Sébastien Lifshitz has recently crossed over into the U.S. market with a string of documentaries about the trans experience. With tender vulnerability and care, the elegantly captured “Little Girl” follows a transgender 7-year-old and her fiercely loving mother as they contend with restrictive school policies in small town France. For his first English-language film, he followed that up with the riveting “Casa Susanna,” which unearthed a hidden chapter of trans history by finding patrons of an upstate New York summer getaway for crossdressers active in the ’50s and ’60s.  Earning multiple awards out of its Berlinale and Sundance festival run, “Kokomo City” arrived like a breath of fresh air into the often staid and predictable documentary film world. Creatively shot by the filmmaker herself, former music producer D. Smith took matters into her own hands when no company would fund a film about Black trans sex workers. With honesty and humor, Smith created a safe space for her subjects to be their beautifully unvarnished selves, discussing a range of topics that usually stay behind closed doors. The film received a tragic round of publicity when one of its stars, Koko da Doll, was found murdered in April. Her death is a painful reminder of the film’s vital importance, especially as anti-trans sentiment and laws proliferate around the country.  Everyone’s favorite weirdo comedian, Julio Torres has forged a career in comedy unlike any other. He began as a writer on “Saturday Night Live” before launching the delightful horror comedy series “Los Espookys” on HBO. A proud Salvadoran immigrant, he tells stories rooted in the absurdity of the immigrant experience that also speak to anyone who lives outside societal norms. His debut feature film, “Problemista,” takes a surrealist approach to the alienating experience of existing between borders. The film stars Torres opposite an unhinged Tilda Swinton in what is sure to be one of the summer’s biggest hits.  After announcing their arrival with the massively successful micro-budget comedy “Shiva Baby,” Emma Seligman rapidly secured their bag, selling a pilot about sugar babies to Adam McKay’s company. Their second feature, the high school-set queer sex comedy “Bottoms,” arrived with considerably more fanfare, and the trailer has already fanned the internet flames that thirst for irreverent queer comedies. Collaborating with their “Shiva Baby” star and muse Rachel Sennott as an official co-writer, “Bottoms” is all but guaranteed to become the “Fire Island” of this summer.  A twisted mind with a reverence for canonical horror, Laura Moss swung big with their feature debut, the riveting medical horror “birth/rebirth.” The film offers a queer riff on Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein,” making subtext text while keeping things unhinged and unpredictable. Premiering at Sundance earlier this year before its Shudder release this August, “birth/rebirth” stars the excellent Marin Ireland as a morgue technician obsessed with reanimating the dead. She spends her nights conducting unsanctioned experiments at home, where she is discovered by a grieving mother and nurse played by Judy Reyes. Bonded by their unnerving mission to bring her little girl back to life, the women push experimentation to the limit as they become embroiled in each other’s madness.  As many strides as LGBTQ film has made in the last decade, most audiences remain in the dark about the lives of intersex people. River Gallo is out to change that. An intersex activist, filmmaker, and performer, Gallo is a driving force in two exciting new films about the intersex experience. Based on their award-winning short of the same name, Gallo wrote and will star in the upcoming feature “Ponyboi,” about an intersex sex worker in a tempestuous romance. The film stars Dylan O’Brien and Murray Bartlett and is slated to premiere sometime next year. Before that, Gallo will appear as a subject in “Every Body,” a new documentary about the lives of three intersex folks directed by Julie Cohen (“RBG”). ",

        "title": "Christopher Nolan Wrote ‘Oppenheimer’ Script in First Person as Oppenheimer: ‘I Don’t Know If Anyone’s Ever Done It Before’",
        "content": "Christopher Nolan‘s “Oppenheimer” (July 21, Universal) is warring it out with the likes of “Barbie” (Warner Bros.) and “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” (Paramount) at this year’s summer box office. But according to the Oscar-nominated director, his three-hour epic about the invention of the atomic bomb offers something those other films don’t: a script written entirely in the first person.Nolan revealed to Empire magazine that he wrote the screenplay completely from the point of view of theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, played by Cillian Murphy in the film in a role the “Batman Begins” actor fought for and stretched his physical limits to portray.“I actually wrote in the first-person, which I’ve never done before,” Nolan said of his film about the leader of the Manhattan Project. “I don’t know if anyone’s ever done it before. But the point of it is, with the colour sequences, which is the bulk of the film, everything is told from Oppenheimer’s point of view — you’re literally kind of looking through his eyes.”Nolan said this strategy was born from “the idea of how we get in somebody’s head and see how they were visualizing this radical reinvention of physics. One of the things that cinema has struggled with historically is the representation of intelligence or genius. It very often fails to engage people.”Nolan gave the finished script to his visual effects supervisor Andrew Jackson, the Oscar winner for “Tenet” who helped Nolan recreate an atomic bomb explosion without CGI.“We have to find a way into this guy’s head. We’ve gotta see the world the way he sees it, we’ve gotta see the atoms moving, we’ve gotta see the way he’s imagining waves of energy, the quantum world,” he told Jackson. “And then we have to see how that translates into the Trinity test. And we have to feel the danger, feel the threat of all this somehow.”Nolan posed to Jackson the ultimate challenge: “Let’s do all these things, but without any computer graphics.”The “Dunkirk” filmmaker admitted that writing a script from a first-person point of view is an “odd thing to do. But it was a reminder to me of how to shoot the film. It was a reminder to everybody involved in the project, ‘Okay, this is the point of view of every scene.’ I wanted to really go through this story with Oppenheimer; I didn’t want to sit by him and judge him. That seemed a pointless exercise. That’s more the stuff of documentary, or political theory, or history of science. This is a story that you experience with him — you don’t judge him. You are faced with these irreconcilable ethical dilemmas with him.”“Oppenheimer,” which was shot entirely on IMAX large-format cameras, marks Nolan’s first R-rated movie since 2002’s “Insomnia.” The film stock runs 11 miles long and weighs a whopping 600 pounds. “Oppenheimer” is currently set to take over IMAX screens beginning July 20 for a three-week run in North America.",

        "title": "‘The Flash’ Review: DC’s Trip Into the Movie Multiverse Is Wild, Weird, and Ultimately Wearying",
        "content": "The release of DC’s “The Flash” comes at a particularly complicated time for the superhero outfit — there’s the myriad documented concerns, both potentially criminal and definitely personal, that have plagued star Ezra Miller, plus the issues that have pushed DC Studios into a moment of change and upheaval — but perhaps the most immediate worry is that the film arrives on the heels of another superhero blockbuster that covers similar ground, and does it better by nearly every metric. That other film is, of course, last week’s smash hit “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” which marks a high-water mark for both Marvel and the superhero sub-genre dedicated to the multiverse movie. Just two weeks after that film’s release, here comes “The Flash,” already a tenuous bet, and now forced to directly compete with the best example yet of what this sort of feature can accomplish.Yet, taken on its own merits, Andy Muschietti’s film has lots to offer, and frequently shows flashes (apologies) of brilliance that set it a cut above most of its existing DC Universe brethren. In its best moments, the film is funny, ambitious, and heartfelt, but it’s also frequently buried under iffy effects, convoluted storytelling, and a been-there-done-that familiarity that’s hard to shake. Just days after so many superhero fans were reminded of the possibility of the genre, “The Flash” mostly feels like a great example of a dying breed of blockbuster joint. It’s, somehow, already dated.The rise of the multiverse is nothing new in the entertainment world — it’s not even new to DC, which has toyed with the concept throughout its many television offerings, including its very own nine-season “The Flash” series — but Muschietti’s film marks the first time the studio has gone all-in on this brand of storytelling in cinematic form. The screenplay, from “Birds of Prey” and “Bumblebee” screenwriter Christina Hodson (with story credits to Joby Harold, John Francis Daley, and Jonathan Goldstein), is a literally classic one, spinning off the iconic “Flashpoint” comic book storyline into DC’s first-ever standalone feature dedicated to The Flash / Barry Allen (Miller). Miller’s Flash has already appeared in a trio of other DC films, but Muschietti’s feature offers the character (perhaps this is a good time to note that, while Barry Allen is male, Miller identifies as non-binary and uses they/them pronouns) the chance to fully inhabit his own story for the first time.A high-energy opening sequence steeps us in Barry’s everyday life, from the necessity of a high-caloric breakfast (and a natty smartwatch that tells him when his energy is running low) to the high levels of popularity he enjoys when he’s in his super suit (he’s basically a nobody when he’s out of it), as the speedster is dispatched to help Batman (Ben Affleck) and Alfred (Jeremy Irons) during a Gotham-set hospital disaster. It’s a wonderful kick-off, showing off The Flash’s prodigious powers and his wily sense of humor, as he cracks wise about being the Justice League’s janitor while also saving a pack of babies in increasingly ingenious ways.But, as is so often the case with our most powerful superheroes, Barry is haunted by his past, which includes a) a dead mother and b) a father who was convicted of her murder and has been in jail ever since. How haunted is Barry? So haunted that even a grizzled Bruce Wayne (Bruce Wayne! the world’s most haunted superhero orphan!) basically tells his young charge to move on, a hard lesson Barry is in no way ready to take to heart. And why should he? Because when Barry puts on that suit, cycles through some heartbreaking memories of his mother’s demise when he was just a kiddo, and runs fast enough, he discovers something wild: he can turn back time.“The Flash” opts for an ambitious — and, we’re guessing, potentially divisive — way of showing off Barry’s time-turning powers: when he runs fast enough, he lands in a massive amphitheater (eventually referred to as the “Chronobowl”) in which every iteration of Barry’s life, every possible universe, flows up and out. All he has to do is run fast enough and far enough, and he can pick which moment to pop back into. Like, oh, perhaps the moment his mother forgot to buy a can of tomatoes, which ultimately led to her death in the Allen family home all those years ago? Barry, for all of his smarts, can’t deny what his heart wants: to save his mother, to save his father, to save himself.If you’ve seen even one other time travel movie, you know where this is going, though with a bit of a twist. Barry goes back in time, pops the can of tomatoes into his mother’s shopping cart, and then zips ahead to rejoin her in his current timeline. Except, it’s not his current timeline (he’s about a decade too early), and when he arrives back at the Allen casa, he’s met with a happy mother (Maribel Verdú), a happy father (Ron Livingston), and a very confused younger Barry (also Miller, now sporting a floppy haircut and a laidback attitude). But while Barry did save his mom, he also upended just about everything else in the process, to the extent that there’s no longer a Justice League, and thus, no one there to save Earth when Michael Shannon’s evil General Zod (last seen in 2013’s “Man of Steel”) arrives, World Engine and all. The butterfly effect, heard of it?Other things have changed, too, flourishes that run the gamut and are often quite funny and clever — this timeline includes everything from a fast casual joint named “Bananabee’s” to a “Back to the Future” franchise that really did star the originally-cast Eric Stoltz (Michael J. Fox? Isn’t he the guy in “Footloose”? Kevin Bacon? No, no, he’s the star of “Top Gun”!) — original enough choices that add real pop to an otherwise heady storyline. But Barry (and, yes, Other Barry) have too many problems to really enjoy them, including yet another major roadblock: Other Barry doesn’t have powers, and when he finally gets them, our original Barry is left without them. Sounds like a fun fight for General Zod.Enter: Michael Keaton, kinda-sorta reprising his Batman here, this time(line) rendered as a hermit who turned away from public life after his Gotham got healed up. Still, he’s a bonafide superhero, and a bit of a genius when it comes to unpacking the complex time-travel concepts and ideas at play here — many of them explained by Keaton and a fresh bowl of spaghetti, actually one of the film’s most clear-eyed metaphors — and the Barrys really need him. (Soon enough, they’ll get another pal, too: Sasha Calle as a stern Kara Zor-El, aka Supergirl.) But as the wacky foursome embark on their quest to save the planet, defeat Zod, and (maybe) set things right, “The Flash” lands on its most compelling element, which also happens to provide a thrilling counterpoint between DC and Marvel’s unfurling and competing multiverses. (Small spoiler alert for “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” here.) In “Across the Spider-Verse” the breaking of “canon” — changing the core events that are duplicated in the life of every Spidey, from being bitten by a radioactive spider to losing a close compatriot who happens to be a police captain — is so dangerous that it has the power to rip the very fabric of the multiverse itself. Changing these key plot points is so horrifying that it’s basically forbidden, but it is possible. In “The Flash,” the concept of canon events is flipped on its head: Bruce calls them “inevitable intersections,” essential moments that occur in every timeline, no matter how many tweaks Barry (or whoever) tries to throw at them.Trying to change these key plot points is indeed scary, but it’s not forbidden, mostly because it’s not possible. Some pieces are malleable — like, for instance, how old Bruce Wayne is or what he looks like (read: which big star is playing the role, Ben Affleck to Michael Keaton, and maybe more) — but there’s still always a Bruce Wayne, there’s always a Batman. That essential stuff, that canon cannot be broken, even if Barry believes he has the tools to do so. And that concept is pushed and pulled — or, in the parlance of one of the film’s most eye-popping and brain-breaking sequences, “collided and collapsed” — throughout the course the film’s big! scary! final! battle! It’s exciting and weird, until it’s repetitive and tiring. It’s wild, until it’s wearying. And it’s original enough, until it simply starts cannibalizing itself.Part of the problem: the way this all looks and moves. This particular story doesn’t work without two Barry Allens and Miller, for all their off-screen troubles, does turn in wonderful, funny, soulful performances in both iterations, but this ambitious idea isn’t entirely supported by the technology at hand. Once you start seeing the seams, the moments when Miller’s face is obviously stitched on another body, when these two superheroes are clearly not in the same room (of course such a thing is not possible, but what of the possibility of movie magic in tricking us to think it?), when the artifice of this entire outing is lost to fuzzy effects, it’s all too easy to fall out of the feature.And then? You can’t help but see more seams, more problems, more cracks. And, as is the case with most time travel stories, the less time you spend trying to understand and untangle how it all works, the better. Once that veil is lifted, it’s hard to fall back into the film (to say nothing of the itchy feeling inspired by its ending, probably once very fun and tongue-in-cheek, but that now feels utterly played out and exhausting).“Don’t live your past, live your life,” Affleck’s Bruce Wayne tells Barry early on, a forward-thinking mantra the entire superhero machine would do well to follow. In its best moments, “The Flash” touches on something new and exciting, but too often, its the past that tugs on, keeping it from speeding ahead.Warner Bros. will release “The Flash” in theaters on Friday, June 16.",

        "title": "Martin Scorsese’s ‘The Irishman’ Kicked off Netflix’s Top 10 by J.Lo’s ‘The Mother’ ",
        "content": "It’s probably not getting an Oscar nominations anytime soon, but “The Mother” has bested Martin Scorsese‘s “The Irishman” where it counts: Netflix viewership metrics. Jennifer Lopez‘s thriller film has entered the streamer’s list of Top 10 most popular English-language films at No. 8, knocking Scorsese’s three-and-a-half hour mobster epic out of the upper echelon.Netflix announced the news on Tuesday, along with the release of viewership numbers for the week of May 29 to June 4. “The Mother,” which has streamed for four weeks after premiering on Netflix May 12, has now been watched for a total of 229.30 million total hours by Netflix subscribers. That’s enough to place it between “Extraction” (231.340 million hours) and “Purple Hearts” (228.69 million hours) on the all-time list, and bump “The Irishman,” which peaked at 214.57 million hours viewed after its first 28 days on the streamer, from the list.Netflix’s all-time Film list now looks like this:“The Mother,” which comes from director Niki Caro and screenwriter Misha Green, stars Lopez as the title character, a U.S. military operative who comes out of hiding to protect the daughter she abandoned from assassins. Joseph Fiennes, Lucy Paez, Omari Hardwick, Paul Raci, and Gael García Bernal all also star in the film, which received mixed reviews when it premiered on Netflix this Spring.Those mixed reviews are in-line with the films it shares the Top 10 with, which tend to consist of starry action or thriller films greeted with shrugs by critics despite their popularity on the streamer, like “Red Notice,” “Bird Box,” “The Gray Man,” “The Adam Project,” “Extraction,” and “The Unforgivable.” Adam McKay’s comedy film “Don’t Look Up” managed to score an Oscar nomination for Best Picture and No. 2 on the Top 10 on the strength of its starry case, despite similar tepid reviews.Although the Top 10 still has a gem in “Glass Onion,” Rian Johnson’s acclaimed sequel to “Knives Out,” “The Irishman” was still the most critically acclaimed film on the list before it officially got bumped out; the gangster epic was nominated for 10 Oscars in 2020. Before it exited the list, it was also one of only two films in the Top 10 to release before the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a massive boost in Netflix’s subscriber numbers; the only film remaining from pre-pandemic days is “Bird Box,” which became a viral phenomenon when it released in 2018. Luckily for Scorsese, he still has a chance to top another streamer’s viewership metrics later this year, when Apple TV+ debuts his highly anticipated and very long “Killers of the Flower Moon.”In addition to announcing “The Mother’s” top 10 ascension, Netflix released their weekly lists of the most popular films and TV shows on the streamer. J.LO topped the English films list, with “The Mother” logging logging 16.48 million hours viewed worldwide. The most viewed title of the week was “FUBAR” starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, which topped the English language TV list with 88.03 million hours viewed. German film “Blood & Gold” and Colombian series “Fake Profile” topped the non-English language Film and TV lists, respectively. Take a look at the weekly charts below.English Films Top 10 List – Week of May 29:English TV Top 10 – Week of May 29:Non-English Films Top 10 List – Week of May 29: Non-English TV Top 10 List – Week of May 29:",

        "title": "The Impact of ‘Asteroid City’ Isn’t Just Oscar Potential — It’s the Future of Specialized Film Itself",
        "content": "Paris-based auteur Wes Anderson filmed his sci-fi comedy “Asteroid City” in Spain during the pandemic in 2021, but it embraced a 1955 American milieu. The well-reviewed movie offers Anderson’s usual sprawling ensemble — Scarlett Johansson, Jason Schwartzman, Bryan Cranston, Tom Hanks, Steve Carell, Margot Robbie, Tilda Swinton, Ed Norton, Adrien Brody, and more — but it’s not the actors who will pop up with Oscar nominations. No one gets enough individual screen time.Like Anderson’s most-lauded “The Grand Budapest Hotel” (2014, Metascore: 88), “Asteroid City” will likely clean up with the crafts, and possibly, like “Moonrise Kingdom” (2012, Metascore: 84), also nab a nod for Original Screenplay.Written by Anderson and long-time screenwriting partner Roman Coppola, “Asteroid City” stars Schwartzman as avuncular writer Augie Steenbeck, typewriter and pipe in tow. He is bringing his whiz-kid scientist son Woodrow (“Eighth Grade” standout Jake Ryan) and three daughters (Ella, Gracie, and Willan Faris) to the Junior Stargazer/Space Cadet convention in the New Mexico desert, where mushroom clouds erupt periodically on the horizon. Joined by his children’s disapproving grandfather (Tom Hanks), the beleaguered widower finally tells his kids that their mother died three weeks ago.Meanwhile, the grieving father cheers himself up by flirting with the glamorous Hollywood star in the cabin next door (Johansson). Soon the group experiences an unsettling alien encounter. And that doesn’t begin to explore the frame-within-a-frame twists and turns of this exhilarating, visually delightful narrative swirl. With “Asteroid City,” Anderson delivers his most accessible and enjoyable comedy since “Moonrise Kingdom” and “Grand Budapest Hotel.”But today, that’s not enough to make a movie become an Oscar contender. It needs to hit at the box office, an outcome that, to be generous, is challenging. With its name auteur and stellar cast, “Asteroid City” serves as a litmus test for not just Oscar glory, but whether the older specialty film audience will still show up at theaters.“In the ongoing dialogue between the specialty market and the audience, we’re all fascinated to see how ‘Asteroid City’ does,” said Roadside Attractions co-president Howard Cohen. “It’s the blue-chip movie for this audience. If they come back for that, are they going to start coming back? So far they haven’t come back with any consistency, partially because there haven’t been that many movies for them.”While some movies don’t need box office to become Oscar contenders (“TAR,” “Triangle of Sadness,” “The Fabelmans”), a June release like “Asteroid City” needs a lot of attention to last. “This big comedy with a huge ensemble has to be a commercial hit to stick its landing to feel hugely relevant in several months,” said one veteran awards campaigner.And will the actors campaign? “Everything they do helps other categories.”Last time around, Searchlight launched anthology film “The French Dispatch,” starring Timothée Chalamet, Frances McDormand, Benicio del Toro, Bill Murray, and Tilda Swinton, at Cannes 2021 (a year later than planned, due to the pandemic). Despite upbeat reviews (Metascore: 74; “Asteroid City” is at 73), the movie underwhelmed at the October domestic box office ($16 million), performed better foreign ($29 million), and landed zero Oscar nominations.This was a far cry from the stellar Oscar performance of “The Grand Budapest Hotel” (Metascore: 88), which Searchlight opened in March 2014. It lasted through awards season, grossing $59 million domestic and $104 million foreign. Those totals were boosted by nine Oscar nominations, including Director, Original Screenplay, and Picture, plus four craft wins (costume design, score, production design, makeup and hairstyling).Two years earlier, Focus launched American summer camp comedy “Moonrise Kingdom” (Metascore: 84) at Cannes, followed by a May North American release that managed $45 million plus $23 million foreign and scored one Oscar nomination for Original Screenplay for Anderson and Coppola.As to where “Asteroid City” will fall on that spectrum, only the art-house audience knows for sure.A Focus Features release, “Asteroid City” will hit select theaters on Friday, June 16, with expansion to follow on Friday, June 23.",

        "content": "A women’s self-defense club in a heightened toxic heterosexual high school? Welcome to “Bottoms.”Rachel Sennott (“The Idol,” “Bodies Bodies Bodies”) co-wrote the high school comedy with “Shiva Baby” director Emma Seligman. Sennott plays queer teen PJ opposite “The Bear” breakout Ayo Edebiri, who portrays PJ’s childhood bestie Josie. The duo lust after their respective crushes, Isabel (Havana Rose Liu) and Brittany (Kaia Gerber), while trying to navigate teendom in the shadow of quarterback Jeff (Nicholas Galitzine) and his cronie, teammate Tim (Miles Fowler).PJ and Josie accidentally found a female fight club, co-run by misfit outcast Hazel (Ruby Cruz), with the hopes to befriend (and hook up) with cheerleaders under the guise of feminism. Marshawn Lynch, Dagmara Dominczyk, and Punkie Johnson also star in the highly anticipated, R-rated summer comedy.Writer-director Seligman told Entertainment Weekly that she opted not to rewatch “Superbad” or “American Pie” because “I think we didn’t want to be influenced by them, but definitely we felt like queer women hadn’t gotten there due from a teen sex comedy.”Lead star Sennott added, “We had references in our mind in terms of ‘Scott Pilgrim,’ ‘Jennifer’s Body,’ ‘Jawbreaker,’ all these different movies. But we also wanted to make sure we weren’t [just] doing one and that it was a mashup of genres. It’s a campy high school movie, but it’s also an action movie. I think no one actually thought that we were gonna make it bloody. We had our producers calling them being like, ‘Did you add quotes?’ And they were like, ‘Just for clarity, it’s not actually a fight club…?’ We were like, ‘It’s a fight club!'”The IndieWire review out of 2023 SXSW praised the film‘s creation of a “weird, parallel world with almost cartoon-like logic, heightened to the point of self-serious parody” in the vein of “Not Another Teen Movie” and “Do Revenge.”“‘Bottoms’ is an ambitious sophomore feature from a director who is just getting started, one that can craft both a hilariously surreal teen sex comedy and marry it with one hell of an eye for action sequences,” the review reads. “Josie and PJ may be at the bottom of the food chain, but Sennott and Seligman are anything but.”“Bottoms” premieres August 25 in theaters.

I didn’t get it. I don’t even think they ever made it, but it was a father-daughter road trip comedy,” Fanning said. “I didn’t hear from my agents because they wouldn’t tell me things like this — that filtration system is really important because there’s probably a lot more damaging comments that they filtered — but this one got to me. I was 16 years old, and a person said, ‘Oh, she didn’t get the father-daughter road trip comedy because she’s unfuckable.'”“The Great” actress added, “It’s so disgusting. And I can laugh at it now, like, ‘What a disgusting pig!'”Fanning continued, “I was always immensely confident, but of course you’re growing up in the public eye, and it’s weird. I’ll look at paparazzi photos from when I was 12 and think, ‘Is that a good thing to see such a mirror of yourself at that age?‘ I don’t feel like it damaged me, but it definitely made me very aware of myself.”Of “The Great,” Fanning said, “I am grateful for the show, because I don’t feel I’m fighting against the child actor thing anymore.”The “Super 8” alum recently shared that she also was not considered for a major franchise role over her social media status. During the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast, Fanning said, “I’m not going to say what it was,” Fanning said, “but I didn’t get a part once for something big because — and it might not have just been this reason, but this was all the feedback that I heard — was because I didn’t have enough Instagram followers at the time.” Elle Fanning most recently joined Timothée Chalamet in the Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown” from Searchlight Pictures, in which she’ll play the folk icon’s early ’60s love interest Sylvie Russo. Besides “The Great,” she was recently seen in Hulu’s “The Girl from Plainville.”",

        "title": "Chris Hemsworth Thinks Tarantino and Scorsese Probably ‘Won’t Work with’ Him After Marvel Comments",
        "content": "Chris Hemsworth is calling out his own marketability to auteurs Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino following their comments slamming the MCU.Hemsworth, who may have made his final Marvel turn in “Thor: Love and Thunder,” addressed the respective statements from Scorsese and Tarantino on the cinematic merits of Marvel movies.“That’s super depressing when I hear that,” Hemsworth told British GQ. “There goes two of my heroes I won’t work with. I guess they’re not a fan of me.”Hemsworth continued, “I’m thankful that I have been a part of something that kept people in cinemas. Now, whether or not those films were to the detriment of other films, I don’t know. I don’t love when we start scrutinizing each other when there’s so much fragility in the business and in this space of the arts as it is.”He clarified, “I say that less to the directors who made those comments, who are all, by the way, still my heroes, and in a heartbeat I would leap to work with any of them. But I say it more to the broader opinion around that topic. I don’t think any of us have the answer, but we’re trying.”Hemsworth admitted that Taika Waititi’s “Love and Thunder” may have become “too silly” of a film as it received mixed reviews.“I think we just had too much fun,” the “Extraction” star said. “It just became too silly. It’s always hard being in the center of it and having any real perspective. I love the process, it’s always a ride. But you just don’t know how people are going to respond.”He added, “It’s a bunch of eight-year-olds critiquing my film. ‘We thought this one had too much humor, the action was cool but the VFX weren’t as good.’ I cringe and laugh equally at it.”Hemsworth said in November 2022 that he is looking to “close the book” on playing Thor.“I feel like we’d probably have to close the book if I ever did it again, you know what I mean? I feel like it probably warrants that,” he shared. “I feel like it’d probably be the finale, but that’s not based on anything anyone’s told me or any sort of plans.”Hemsworth noted that he also is not looking to work with any “mad genius” directors moving forward.“I’m just at the point of my life where I’m meeting with different directors and [people say] ‘Oh yeah, look, he’s a mad genius. He’s mad, but he’s a genius and he’ll make great films,’” Hemsworth said. “I’m like, ‘Is that who I want to spend my days with?’ Four months, five months of shooting and then you’ve got press and possible reshoots and so on.”",

        "title": "‘The Super Mario Bros. Movie’ Powers Up on PVOD, As Netflix Discovers ‘To Leslie’",
        "content": "Get ready for a continuation of the recurrent rotation between “The Super-Mario Bros.” (Universal) and “John Wick: Chapter 4” (Lionsgate) as #1 and #2 on PVOD charts. Both films (each priced at $19.99) will likely add two more weeks minimum back and forth atop the lists after a similar battle the last two.Netflix meantime has about as top-heavy a list of older theatrical releases, with only one original making their top 10 (in tenth place). Of note there — “To Leslie,” virtually unknown before Andrea Riseborough’s surprise Oscar Best Actress nomination, initially reached #1 before dropping to a still notable #2 (behind the 2013 comedy “We’re the Millers”).“John Wick” kept “SMB” from a second week at #1 when it was released. But this week, “SMB,” by far the biggest domestic theatrical hit for 2023 so far, returned to #1 at both iTunes and Vudu. “John Wick” still leads at Google Play, but that site usually lags for a few days, so the same could occur there.With the next recent hit to hit home-viewing not expected for another two weeks (“Fast X” is expected but not confirmed after its fifth weekend), nothing is certain to challenge these two films. “Are You There, God? It’s Me Margaret” (Lionsgate) will be available on Tuesday. Despite its underwhelming theatrical run ($20 million gross through six weekends), it’s the kind of well-reviewed film that has the potential as well as the need to do better at home.Three recent releases, the biggest grossing of which managed just over $5 million in gross, made initial top ten incursions. “Nefarious” (Soli Deo), a faith-based demonic thriller which passed that minimal threshold to make all three charts, as high as #5 on Vudu. “Hypnotic” (Ketchup), like “Nefarious” at $19.99, with Robert Rodriguez’s $65 million flop with Ben Affleck reached #3 on Vudu. “BlackBerry” (IFC), typical of that company’s usual pricing at $6.99 initially, is #4 on iTunes.“65” (Sony) and “Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” (Paramount), both now $5.99, complete the films placing across the board. “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” (Sony), only $3.99 (which makes it unlikely to show up on revenue-tallying Vudu) is #3 on iTunes and #4 on Google Play. iTunes continues its listing pre-orders on their list, with the brand-new “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” (Sony) at #10 months ahead of its likely availablity.What usually distinguishes Netflix’s top movies is the interesting mixture of library titles they licence and their originals. This week hardly fits, with only one original making the list. Number 10 is “A Beautiful Life.” It’s a struggling singer skyrockets to fame after a lucky break story, which could be set anywhere. In this case, it’s Denmark, with Danish actor/singer Christopher starring.Over the weekend, “To Leslie,” which had virtually no theatrical play and barely made a blip when released on VOD, actually hit #1 at Netflix. It still is in second place. It’s the kind of film that, had it been a Netflix Original, could have also gotten some eyeballs. There’s no way to say how much all the attention the Oscar nomination and controversy elevated interest, but it is another sign that there is still some benefit from getting awards attention.iTunes and Google Play rank films daily by number of transactions.

        "title": "Finn Wolfhard Was Told He Was Too ‘Young’ to Direct a Movie: ‘We’re Going to Mess Up a Lot’",
        "content": "Finn Wolfhard struggled to find financing for his directorial debut “Hell of a Summer,” which he co-directed and co-wrote with Billy Bryk.The “Stranger Things” breakout star told Entertainment Weekly that at age 20, he was met with skepticism from financiers over his ability to helm a feature.“That’s what everyone said when we tried to get money for this movie,” Wolfhard said. “They’re like, ‘You’re a little young to be directing a movie.’ I’m like, ‘Yep.'”He added, “Oh my God, they gave money to two kids to make a crazy [movie].’ Not to downplay it, I’m incredibly proud of it, but it was a crazy thing.”The child star continued, “We’d like to let the film speak for itself. I don’t think age defines filmmaking in any way. I think everyone has stories to tell, and if you have the chance to do it, then do it.”Wolfhard admitted that he and Bryk have “enough self-awareness” to accept that there would be hiccups helming their first movie.“We’re really young, we’re going mess up a lot, and we’re going to make mistakes. Let’s just ride the wave and be as communicative with everyone as possible and make everyone feel a part of the team,” Wolfhard said. “It was really informative. I learned more on that set about myself and about other people and about running a set and working with different personalities. I learned more in those three weeks than I have my whole life.”“Hell of a Summer” centers on an older summer camp counselor who becomes the main suspect in a series of deaths. Wolfhard noted that growing up in the spotlight led him to feel empowered to step behind the camera. Wolfhard and Bryk star, along with Fred Hechinger (“The White Lotus”), D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai (“Reservation Dogs”), Abby Quinn (“Mad About You”), and Pardis Saremi (“Career Opportunities in Murder and Mayhem”). The film completed post-production earlier this year but is still seeking U.S. distribution.“Since I was maybe 10 or 11, I’ve been watching tons of movies, I’ve been watching behind the scenes on movies, I would stay after work on set to watch all the directors and learn from them and how sets work,” the “When You Finish Saving the World” actor said. “So I felt a little in my element at some points. At some points, I felt completely terrified and like I was flailing, but we had a great cast and crew. It was great. It was all the things, right? It was a small movie in the middle of nowhere in Canada, and it was incredible and hilarious. It was one of the best experiences of my life.”",

        "title": "‘Transformers: Rise of the Beasts’ Review: Who Knew Robot Gorillas Could Be This Boring?",
        "content": "At a certain point, watching a new “Transformers” movie becomes an exercise in expectation management. Since launching with a bang in 2007, the franchise first spearheaded by Michael Bay has spent 16 years sliding into a sludgy pit of CGI malaise many hold up as the epitome of Hollywood’s worst impulses. The well-received “Bumblebee” may be the exception that proves the rule. But in 2023 — when you have no one but yourself to blame for paying real, human money to a robot gorilla named Optimus Primal — it’s not unfair to wonder if the series has irreparably bottomed out.Still, the temptation to let films like “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” off the hook via state-of-play victim blaming should be avoided. The Hasbro franchise has long benefitted from low expectations, but the latest entry doesn’t come close to a passing grade on the massive curve we’ve already agreed to score it on. Steven Caple Jr.’s 1990s-set prequel fails to provide either merit or escapism, seemingly begging you to turn your brain off while bombarding you with stimuli that keep you painfully awake and aware for an unusually long two hours and 16 minutes.Our story begins centuries before the dawn of man, when a planet-devouring force of evil known as Unicron tries to devour a planet in a very evil way. A group of robotic animals, known as Maximals, who inhabit the planet are forced to flee — which is a fairly straightforward process because they have a doodad called the Transwarp key allowing them to open wormholes and travel through time and space. The ragtag gang led by Optimus Primal (Ron Perlman) soon end up on a little rock called Earth.Fast forward to 1994, where Noah Diaz (Anthony Ramos) is looking for a break. The unemployed Brooklynite desperately needs a job to help pay his adorable kid brother’s medical bills, but his reputation as an uncooperative soldier from his Army days is making work hard to come by. He reluctantly agrees to help his anti-capitalist friend steal luxury cars to get some much-needed cash, but the first Porsche he breaks into ends up being a Transformer who kidnaps him. When it rains, it pours.The Porsche takes him on a harrowing police chase through New York, but none of the near-death experiences are as horrifying as the blue machine’s personality. Mirage (Pete Davidson) is an easygoing stoner robot whose language capabilities appear to be limited to “well that happened”-style one-liners. On a normal day, his insufferable running commentary would easily be the biggest problem facing our new “Transformers” hero. But there’s not much time for comedic analysis when the world is about to end.Mirage and his Transformers friends, led by the infallible Optimus Prime, reveal that Unicron has sent a lackey named Scourge (Peter Dinklage) to Earth to retrieve the Transwarp key. If he gets it, our planet could easily be devoured. They convince Noah to break into a museum to steal an antique vase that it’s been hidden in — before revealing that the vase only contained half of the key. The other half is hidden with the Maximals in Peru, so Noah, Mirage, and a plucky museum intern named Elena (Dominique Fishback) head to the Southern Hemisphere to save the world before Scourge can get there.Despite the misleading title, the first half of “Rise of the Beasts” is devoted to watching the regular non-beast Transformers hang out in Brooklyn. The Maximals don’t have a real impact until we get to Peru, and even then they spend most of their time standing around and lamenting that the world is going to end. Scourge seems dangerously close to destroying the planet on multiple occasions, only for Optimus Prime to reveal that he can’t end the world until he finds another McGuffin. (First he needs the key, then we learn there was a second half of the key, then he needs a code to operate the key that — you guessed it — is also split into two parts). By the time the Maximals team up with Optimus Prime for a half-assed final battle (which just so happens to result in the destruction of Machu Picchu?), audience emotions have been transparently manipulated so many times it’s impossible to muster any kind of investment.The most tragic part of the entire debacle is the realization that Hasbro saw this movie as an opportunity to introduce grander storytelling ambitions. A final scene teases an “Avengers”-style team-up between the Transformers and another iconic toy franchise, presumably against a cosmic bad guy whose evil impulses are so generic that completely unrelated IPs can unite against them. It’s as if some executive saw Mattel and Greta Gerwig turning “Barbie” into genuine art, so they made a George Costanza-style decision to veer in the opposite direction purely out of spite.A Paramount Pictures release, “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” opens in theaters on Friday, June 9.",

        "title": "SAG-AFTRA Members Approve Strike Authorization with 97.91 Percent of Vote",
        "content": "Members of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) have overwhelmingly approved a strike authorization vote ahead of the union beginning negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), with 97.91 percent of members who participated voting “yes” in the vote.The guild also announced that nearly 65,000 members cast ballots, which is 47.69 percent of the guild’s over 160,000 members who were eligible to send in ballots. Only 75 percent “yes” votes were necessary in order to grant guild leaders the power to call for a strike if necessary.This doesn’t mean that the actors are definitely going on strike, but merely that they’re willing to go to the picket lines if a fair deal isn’t reached with the studios.SAG took the surprising step of authorizing a strike even before negotiations with the AMPTP begin on June 7, and both SAG’s negotiating committee and national board unanimously approved the authorization vote back in May. It gives the guild added leverage once talks begin this week.SAG’s contract with the studios expires on June 30, and the WGA has been on strike since May 1. SAG’s contract talks come in the wake of the DGA reaching a deal with the AMPTP over the weekend. While the conventional wisdom is that the financial gains and language surrounding AI could serve as a pattern for other guilds in their own talks, both SAG and the WGA have been clear they will not allow the DGA’s deal to influence their own negotiating agenda.“The strike authorization votes have been tabulated and the membership joined their elected leadership and negotiating committee in favor of strength and solidarity. I’m proud of all of you who voted as well as those who were vocally supportive, even if unable to vote. Everyone played a part in this achievement,” said SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher. “Together we lock elbows and in unity we build a new contract that honors our contributions in this remarkable industry, reflects the new digital and streaming business model and brings ALL our concerns for protections and benefits into the now! Bravo SAG-AFTRA, we are in it to win it.”“I could not be more pleased with this response from the membership. This overwhelming yes vote is a clear statement that it’s time for an evolution in this contract. As we enter what may be one of the most consequential negotiations in the union’s history, inflation, dwindling residuals due to streaming, and generative AI all threaten actors’ ability to earn a livelihood if our contracts are not adapted to reflect the new realities. This strike authorization means we enter our negotiations from a position of strength, so that we can deliver the deal our members want and deserve,” said SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland.The AMPTP said in a statement to press that “We are approaching these negotiations with the goal of achieving a new agreement that is beneficial to SAG-AFTRA members and the industry overall.”If the actors were to join the writers on strike, virtually all production would shut down across Hollywood, leading to further delays in the TV season and likely delays in the release of future feature films. As IndieWire recently reported, uncertainty over what the actors may do has spooked insurance providers to grant completion bonds, an essential step for independent films to obtain financing.Like the writers, some of the key issues in negotiations with the studios include improved residual payments and addressing concerns over the use of AI. But the guild is also concerned with obtaining higher compensation and an improvement to the guild’s health plan, and the guild also wants to establish guidelines around “self-tapes,” or self-taped auditions that the guild says are “unregulated and out of control” and put a costly burden on actors in the audition process.The Screen Actors Guild last went on strike back in 2018 for 10 months against the advertising agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty and in 2016 for 11 months, the longest in the guild’s history, against the major video game companies. When both SAG and AFTRA (American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) were separate unions back in 2000, the two joined forces and went on strike for a new commercial contract for six months.",

        "title": "Anthony Hopkins on MCU ‘Thor’ Roles: ‘If You’re Sitting in Front of a Green Screen, It’s Pointless Acting It’",
        "content": "Anthony Hopkins doesn’t feel the need to go Method in Marvel films.The “Silence of the Lambs” Oscar winner told The New Yorker that appearing in Marvel films “Thor,” “Thor: The Dark World,” and “Thor: Ragnarok” had a “pointless” approach to acting due to the green screen CGI-heavy superhero films.“They put me in armor; they shoved a beard on me,” Hopkins recalled. “Sit on the throne, shout a bit. If you’re sitting in front of a green screen, it’s pointless acting it.”“Thor: Love and Thunder” actor (and fellow Academy Award winner) Christian Bale previously said it would be a “pitiful attempt” to apply classical acting techniques to play an MCU villain.“That would’ve been a pitiful attempt to do that, as I’m trying to get help getting the fangs in and out and explaining I’ve broken a nail, or I’m tripping over the tunic,” Bale said during a fall 2022 GQ story.Bale continued of working with green screens, “That’s the first time I’ve done that. I mean, the definition of it is monotony. You’ve got good people. You’ve got other actors who are far more experienced at it than me. Can you differentiate one day from the next? No. Absolutely not. You have no idea what to do. I couldn’t even differentiate one stage from the next. They kept saying, ‘You’re on Stage Three.’ Well, it’s like, ‘Which one is that?’ ‘The blue one.’ They’re like, ‘Yeah. But you’re on Stage Seven.’ ‘Which one is that?’ ‘The blue one.’ I was like, ‘Uh, where?'”In contrast, Oscar winner Jared Leto stayed in character as Morbius even during bathroom breaks on set. Director Daniel Espinosa said in April 2022 that “it’s people’s processes. All of the actors believe in processes. And you, as director, you support whatever makes it as good as you can be.”Espinosa continued of Leto staying in character despite the role’s physical ailments, “What Jared thinks, what Jared believes, is that somehow the pain of those movements, even when he was playing normal Michael Morbius, he needed, because he’s been having this pain his whole life.”",

        "title": "‘Something You Said Last Night’ Trailer: A Charming Portrait of Trans Youth in Flux",
        "content": "It remains needlessly difficult for trans films to secure funding — even ones with big names attached. As exciting new films like “Monica” and “Something You Said Last Night” finally secure overdue releases, a new advent of sensitively rendered trans films is on the horizon. After premiering at last year’s Toronto International Film Festival, where this critic was impressed by its subtle humor and intimate storytelling, the charming family dramedy “Something You Said Last Night” will hit theaters this summer. IndieWire is proud to premiere the trailer exclusively.Hailing from first time feature filmmaker Luis De Filippis, “Something You Said Last Night” takes place over a single week during one tight-knit family’s lakeside summer vacation. The film stars magnetic newcomer Carmen Madonia as Renata, a 20-something trans woman who is still navigating the confusion of early adulthood. In a refreshing turn from most trans stories, she has a fairly healthy relationship with her family, and she’s especially close with her rambunctious and overly supportive mother Mona (Ramona Milano).That family bond was important to show for De Filippis, who says she’s ready for a new normal when it comes to trans narratives.“My relationship with my mother is very warm and very supportive, and we just don’t see those stories about trans women and the relationships with their mothers,” De Filippis told IndieWire during a recent phone interview. “Usually there’s some kind of lesson that the mother has to be taught, or by the end of the film, the mother’s on board. But I really want to tell a story about what happens after all those conversations have had happened. What if the mother never had an issue with it to start off with? What if the mother was always the biggest cheerleader?”The film perfectly captures the claustrophobic feeling of being trapped with your family when you feel like an adult but don’t quite live like one yet. Stuck in a tiny hotel room, Renata is a typical lost 20-something, trying to find her place in the world and figuring out how to follow her passions while supporting herself. Her trans identity is omnipresent because it’s an indelible part of who she is and how she experiences the world, but her story is universal.“I really just wanted to tell a story about a girl who is trans, but what’s at the center of the story is her relationship with her family and how she’s moving through the world,” De Filippis said. “Some of her issues are occurring because she’s trans, but a lot of them are not because she’s trans, it’s just because she’s a young woman going through what a young woman goes through today.”While “Monica” was a major achievement for trans cinema, De Filippis is part of a growing roster of trans filmmakers telling their own stories. Vuk Lungulov-Klotz’s “Mutt” will get a release from Strand later this summer, as well as two excellent documentaries from trans women filmmakers, “Kokomo City” and “The Stroll.” But there is always more progress to be made.“We need different types of stories about different types of trans women,” De Filippis said. “These are all wins, but where we’re still lacking is fictional stories being told by trans women about trans women. That being said, I’m personally not going anywhere. I’m going to keep telling stories I want to tell, and if there’s one thing the Dolls have, it’s tenacity. So let’s keep going.”“Something You Said Last Night” hits theaters in Canada on July 7 and will be available in the U.S. in August.",

        "content": "The “Community” plan for six seasons and a movie has hit a snag amid the ongoing WGA strike.Joel McHale, star of the off-beat sitcom ensemble alongisde Alison Brie, Yvette Nicole Brown, Donald Glover, Danny Pudi, Gillian Jacobs, Chevy Chase, Jim Rash and Ken Jeong, gave an update on the previously announced Peacock movie adaptation. To note, original cast members Brown, Chase, and Glover are not confirmed to be returning for the film.“We had a shooting date coming up, which was going to be in the summer,” McHale told Variety. “And I think they were extremely close to — I mean, [creator] Dan [Harmon] is somebody that tweaks things but, obviously, that’s all stopped. But I think it was pretty darn close.”McHale, who is executive-producing the film, continued, “It was close, the shoot date was coming up and we were all excited to do it and then the writers strike happened, which obviously put everything on hold, and rightfully so. The writers are asking for very reasonable things. Writers need to be paid properly.”Series creator Harmon and co-writer Andrew Guest are penning the script for the “Community” film. McHale noted that a director is close to being confirmed.“I know who wants to do it and we’re talking to and is interested and engaged,” the former “Soup” talk show host said.Showrunner Harmon previously addressed the long-awaited film version.“The fan that Instagrams every day about ‘Community,’ how can you tell them, ‘Yes, it’s definitely going to happen, but it may be between one and eight years from now’ — which is how the industry works, especially when you factor in pandemics and whatnot,” Harmon said when last hinting at the possibility of a movie. “It just feels like psychological torture, from a fan’s perspective, to keep looking into the backseat of a station wagon and saying, ‘Who wants McDonald’s?’ And to just keep driving down the freeway. I don’t want to be guilty of causing that sensation. It just takes so long sometimes.”“Community” premiered in 2009 and followed a group of misfit community college students. The series won a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation in 2011.",

        "title": "DGA Member: Other Guilds ‘Can Absolutely’ Benefit from Directors’ Gains",
        "content": "When the Directors Guild of America reached a tentative new collective bargaining agreement with the AMPTP over the weekend, all eyes turned back to the writers (now on strike for over a month), and to the actors, who will announce the results of its own strike authorization vote this week as it begins studio negotiations.Conventional wisdom held that a DGA deal could serve as a framework for writers, just as it did in 2007-08, when the DGA reached a deal on the 73rd day of the WGA‘s 100-day work stoppage. But both the WGA and SAG-AFTRA have made clear the outcome of the DGA would not impact their own negotiating agendas.“Thrilled that the DGA was able to use the power of the WGA’s labor action to secure a deal that works for them,” writer-producer Amy Berg said in a tweet thread. “We proposed a number of these terms… before the AMPTP cut off negotiations in order to hand a deal to the DGA. They will continue to not speak to us, offering them next to SAG. But we have needs in areas they don’t, and will secure a deal that works for us. This isn’t it.”“As a DGA member this deal looks great. As a WGA member, this deal is proof the AMPTP just doesn’t respect writers,” writer-director Travon Free added. “The fact that you can make an historic deal with the people who can’t even do their jobs until writers do theirs screams all you need to know about the AMPTP.”According to one DGA-WGA hyphenate who spoke to IndieWire, the deal stemmed from a negotiation made in good faith and will help other guilds get what they need.“We know the crews are sacrificing,” the DGA member said. “We want everybody to be back to work, but back to work in terms that work for them so that they’re satisfied and they can pay their bills. So we knew we needed to make a deal. We knew we needed to make a good deal, and a good deal that would translate to the other guilds, and I’m really proud that we did that. So they can absolutely pick up the gains that we have, and then they can dive into the specific things that are not related to the DGA. They now can focus on that.”Negotiations between the DGA and AMPTP took place at the Sherman Oaks Galleria over the last four weeks and wrapped at midnight heading into Sunday morning. As announced over the weekend, directors will get a 5 percent pay bump in the first year of a contract, 4 percent in the second year, and 3.5 percent in the third, plus a .5 percent raise to fund a parental leave benefit. Annual raises in past contract negotiations typically sat around 3 percent.By comparison, the WGA asked for annual percentage raises of 6-5-5 and the AMPTP countered with 4-3-2. On a total percentage basis, the DGA deal splits the difference, though some WGA members have noted online that those gains don’t keep pace with current inflation rates. The member said other DGA members too are “over the moon” about the deal and for the minimum wage increases in particular.The directors also negotiated a 76 percent increase in foreign residuals for streaming shows, and the member described increases in studio data transparency as “major.” No specifics have been revealed regarding data transparency, which is also a WGA priority.The DGA member said the deal’s AI language, which states that it cannot be considered a “person” or replace the work of members, represented a lot of negotiation from major power players and hyphenates. “I’ve never been in a negotiation where you’re making agreements over things that we don’t yet fully understand,” they said. “So I’m really proud of everybody rising to the occasion. This is going to shape the rest of our lives.”The member continued: “We didn’t think we’d have to spell this out. But hey, we’re spelling it out to protect our industry, to protect our craft, and protect our jobs.”There’s dissent in every negotiation and other hyphenates bristled over learning about the deal in the press in the wee hours of the night. Some have even threatened to vote against the tentative deal in solidarity with the WGA.“This DGA deal is so disappointing to me,” “God’s Country” director Julian Higgins wrote in his Instagram story on Monday. “Setting aside the deal terms themselves, which don’t seem to meet the threat or the opportunity of the moment, this is a time to link arms with our fellow artists in mutual support and solidarity!! We rise and fall together. The way this was handled by DGA leadership has left every member I’ve spoken to feeling ignored and disrespected.”“I’d vote NOT to accept DGA deal struck, and request that our guild’s acceptance of what was negotiated is conditional on the WGA and SAG deals are worked out first as well,” “Moon” director Duncan Jones tweeted.That may change once full terms are revealed. The tentative contract includes payment for “soft-prep,” the location scouting, casting, VFX work, and more that most film directors usually do for free. Directors will get more say in the editing room, with unit production managers and assistant directors seeing residuals. TV directors also gained a guaranteed additional shoot day to help storytelling, as well as reductions in work hours and better safety benefits (including the on-set ban of live ammunition, following the “Rust” tragedy).Had the directors concluded negotiations this week without a deal — just as SAG-AFTRA begins its negotiations — the DGA member felt it would have prevented further talks and put the industry in a tough spot.“Maybe I’m the lone optimist, but actually I’m not,” the DGA member said. “A lot of people really believe that this was the best thing for the DGA and the industry. They see the directors making this deal is better for the industry than the directors failing to make a deal and going on strike, which really would’ve been a threat to the whole ecosystem. Striking can be very effective, but there’s a limitation to how effective a strike is, and we’re all trying to figure out the best way to help each of the unions get what they need.”",

        "content": "Steven Spielberg is opening up about feeling torn as a parent and a director during production on “E..T” with then-child-star Drew Barrymore.The Oscar-winning filmmaker addressed being “helpless” over how Barrymore’s tumultuous home life was evident during the making of the 1982 fantasy film. Barrymore was seven years old at the time.“She was staying up way past her bedtime, going to places she should have only been hearing about, and living a life at a very tender age that I think robbed her of her childhood,” Spielberg told Vulture. “Yet I felt very helpless because I wasn’t her dad. I could only kind of be a consigliere to her.”Barrymore’s father, former actor John Drew Barrymore, was an abusive alcoholic. “Talk about someone who was not a careerist,” Barrymore said. “He was like, ‘I will burn this fucking dynasty to the ground.'”As a child star, Barrymore called Spielberg “the only person in my life to this day that ever was a parental figure.” Spielberg even shot “E.T.” in continuity to keep the magic of the story alive for Barrymore.“I didn’t want to burst the bubble,” Spielberg said, citing that he had to explain why the puppet had multiple people operating it. “So I simply said, ‘It’s OK, E.T. is so special, E.T. has eight assistants. I am the director, I only have one.'”Barrymore later asked if Spielberg could be her father; when he said no, he agreed to become her godfather. Barrymore stayed with the Spielberg family on weekends.Years later, Barrymore similarly stayed with director Tamra Davis after being cast in 1992’s “Guncrazy.” At the time, Davis explained, Barrymore “did not have a good reputation” coming out of rehab.“But she came in and said, ‘Nobody takes me seriously. I want to prove that I can come back.’ And I just melted,” Davis said. “I immediately was like, ‘Oh my God, I love you. I will do anything I can to help you out.'”She added, “I felt like she was kind of our daughter. We provided this surreal, stable family for her, where she lived with us and she got to just focus on being an actress.”Barrymore said of Davis, “I showed up in her house late at night with my laundry basket, and she said I could stay in her guest room, and then I didn’t leave for eight months.”Barrymore previously opened up about her enduring parental relationship with Spielberg, telling The Wall Street Journal, “Not having a dad, not having that kind of relationship with anyone, he was just so good and nurturing and kind. We still have a really wonderful relationship. I thank him because, had he not chosen me, I think my life would be really different. It’s crazy when you can really trace it back to someone.”",

        "title": "Louis C.K. #MeToo Documentary Dropped by Showtime",
        "content": "The documentary capturing comedian Louis C.K.‘s #MeToo scandal has been shelved at Showtime.Director Caroline Suh (“Blackpink: Light Up the Sky”) was originally set to helm the documentary announced by Paramount Global exec David Nevins in August 2022. Nevins exited Paramount in October 2022.Showtime confirmed to IndieWire that the documentary would not be moving forward but did not provide additional reasons as to why. Variety first reported the news.“Louis C.K. is a slightly different situation [compared to Harvey Weinstein],” then-Showtime CEO Nevins said at the time. “[He is] a great, great comedian who has come back in his own way.”Nevins added, “I don’t think the social change that #MeToo has brought about is resolved at all. There’s a bit of backlash against #MeToo, who has to go away and who’s allowed to come back.”The documentary was set to chart C.K.’s exit from projects in 2017 following multiple allegations of sexual misconduct. Netflix, HBO, and FX (where C.K. had an overall deal) cut ties with the comedian following the allegations of the comedian exposing himself to women.The New York Times reporters who broke the story that C.K. had been accused of masturbating in front of five women were set to participate in the film, produced by Amanda Branson-Gill (“Mrs. America”) and The New York Times.C.K. issued a statement at the time of the accusations, saying, “These stories are true. When you have power over another person, asking them to look at your dick isn’t a question. It’s a predicament for them. The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly.”The “Louie” creator won his third Grammy for a 2020 self-released comedy special “Sincerely, Louis C.K.” and debuted the film “Fourth of July” last summer. C.K. later went on a 24-city, sold-out nationwide tour in 2021.C.K. accuser Julie Wolov spoke out on the comedian being seemingly immune to cancel culture, saying, “Nobody cares. That’s the message this sends. I don’t believe in cancel culture, but obviously, Louis is not canceled. He seems fine to me. He’s touring. He’s selling out. He’s winning Grammys….What is wrong with people? Wouldn’t it be nice if people would not be rewarded for bad behavior? But what are you supposed to do? These people voted for him. I guess that’s what happens when comedy and music come together.”",

        "title": "Studio Ghibli Won’t Promote Miyazaki’s ‘How Do You Live?’ in Japan in Mysterious Marketing Play",
        "content": "Studio Ghibli and producer Toshio Suzuki announced that there will be no advertisements or trailers for Hayao Miyazaki‘s “How Do You Live?” in Japan prior to its July 14 release, per a recent interview with Japanese magazine Bungei Shunji (translated by The Hollywood Reporter). All we’ve seen so far is a hand-drawn poster (below).While the U.S. and international release dates have yet to be announced, Studio Ghibli producer and general manager Suzuki said that the distribution company sought to “do something different” with the rollout of “How Do You Live?”“As part of company operations, over the years Ghibli has wanted people to come see the movies we’ve made,” Suzuki said. “So we’ve thought about that and done a lot of different things for that purpose — but this time we were like, ‘Eh, we don’t need to do that.’ Doing the same thing you’ve done before, over and over, you get tired of it. So we wanted to do something different.”Suzuki added, “There’s an American movie — ah, I almost said the title out loud! — coming out this summer around the same time [as ‘How Do You Live?’]. They’ve made three trailers for it, and released them one at a time. If you watch all three, you know everything that’s going to happen in that movie. So how do moviegoers feel about that? There must be people, who, after watching all the trailers, don’t want to actually go see the movie. So, I wanted to do the opposite of that.”The Studio Ghibli highly anticipated new film is Miyazaki’s first directorial effort since 2013’s “The Wind Rises.” The director came out of retirement in 2016 to announce “How Do You Live?” which is among the top animated releases of this summer. An international release date has not been set, though a fall rollout is expected for the film in the U.S.IndieWire has reached out to U.S. representatives for Studio Ghibli for comment.“How Do You Live?” is an adaptation of Yoshino Genzaburo’s 1937 story about a young boy who comes of age while living with his uncle after the death of his father. Miyazaki is dedicating the film to his own grandson.“I’ve been involved with our movies since Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind [in 1984], but this was the first time Hayao Miyazaki genuinely praised me,” Suzuki recalled. “‘Suzuki-san, this is amazing. This is the best poster you’ve ever made,’ he said. I felt like that was a hint, so I decided ‘Let’s go with just this one poster for the marketing.’ So, no trailers or TV commercials at all…No newspaper ads either. Deep down, I think this is what moviegoers latently desire.”Suzuki previously gave an update on “How Do You Live?” in 2020, citing that while production continued during the COVID-19 lockdown, the film was still at least three years away from being completed due to Miyazaki’s determination to hand-draw every frame.“We are still hand-drawing everything, but it takes us more time to complete a film because we’re drawing more frames,” Suzuki said at the time. “So, there are more drawings to draw than before. Back when we were making ‘My Neighbor Totoro,’ we only had eight animators. ‘Totoro’ we made in eight months. [For] the current film that Miyazaki is working on, we have 60 animators, but we are only able to come up with one minute of animation in a month. That means 12 months a year, you get 12 minutes worth of movie. Actually, we’ve been working on this film for three years, so that means we have 36 minutes completed so far. We’re hoping it will finish in the next three years.”Suzuki admitted he was at first skeptical to sign on to another Miyazaki film after the director un-retired.“Many directors make films on and on and on throughout their careers as they grow older,” Suzuki said. “When Miyazaki came back and said that I want to make a film again, I actually said that’s not a great idea because he’s achieved so much already. You can’t come back and do something that you’ve already done in the past, you have to do something different. One of the ideas that came out from that was, why not spend more time and spend more money [to make a film]? So, that’s one of the new approaches.”Today producer Toshio Suzuki declared that Studio Ghibli won't publish any image / trailer / advertisment before the release of new Hayao Miyazaki's movie \"How do you live ?\" on July 14th.\nThis old teaser poster will remain the only picture available.https://t.co/Is13FxZIZ7 https://t.co/thY5idUvTf pic.twitter.com/SePSPFqtYS",

        "title": "Why ‘Across the Spider-Verse’ Cut a Post-Credits Scene with Villain Spot",
        "content": "[Editor’s note: The following interview contains spoilers for both “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” and its post-credits, well, kind of scenes.]\n\nWondering why there is no “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” post-credits scene? That’s because nothing they tried fit. “Hard to beat where we left off,” producer Phil Lord told IndieWire. However, there was a promising idea that was scrapped as a follow-up to a never completed scene in the film. It involved Spot (Jason Schwartzman), the bizarre-looking nemesis who’s all white with black spots that serve as inter-dimensional portals.According to Lord and producing partner Chris Miller, the first scene had Spot hanging out at a Spidey villain bar but can’t get a drink because no one will notice him. “And then he finally steals the drink for himself and he pours it down and it all leaks out of his holes,” Lord said. “He’s the dorkiest villain. A great line that Chris wrote, though: ‘Trying to fill a hole in his heart with more holes.’ Not a great method.”Schwartzman, however, was fascinated by his character’s bizarre existential crisis. “[Schwartzman] was really interested and curious about a person who’s missing things,” Miller told IndieWire. “And he’s sort of on the same path as Miles Morales, just taken the darker route. He feels left out and alone and wants to be seen and appreciated like we all do.”Yet, after starting off as an inept villain who can’t even rob an ATM, Spot eventually becomes a serious threat to the Spider-Verse. He gains strength from a super Collider and learns to control his portals. In the proposed post-credits tag, Spot returns to the villain bar as a badass, sits proudly in the coveted booth, and dispatches all the baddies who previously made fun of him.“That was one of my favorite things, seeing this guy get picked on and then come back and, with just a whisper, demolishes every person that comes at him,” Alan Hawkins, returning head of character animation, told IndieWire. “But you have to have both of those sequences for that to work.”Hawkins was part of the 1,000 crew team at Sony Pictures Imageworks that raised the bar substantially from the ground-breaking, Oscar-winning “Into the Spider-Verse.” They created a new set of tools to take more complex 2D stylization of comic book designs into 3D animation. Spot, as the most complex character, required many of them to achieve his different looks. They included an artistically driven line art pipeline, brush tools, ink-dripping tech, and a non-photorealistic comp tool for producing multiple types of edges on every spot.Spot evolves throughout the film, going from a rough drawing to a fully-formed character, with line work tracing his shape and each ink drop in his body looking and behaving differently.“The whole thing with him was he was supposed to be the absence of color, the absence of rendering,” returning VFX supervisor Mike Lasker told IndieWire. “Basically, he’s like a drawing that’s built up from nothing. We tried to treat him like he was a painting, ink washed when he’s in shadow and white paint brushed when he’s in light. And the spots were first created in animation and then effects would replace them with more inky smear spot techniques. As Spot grew in strength, you’d see those ink spots get more active and busier and move around and have more personality and come off his body. Nothing was static, he was always moving.”After scrapping an early concept of a shape-shifting face that didn’t match the rest of his body, Hawkins and the animation team regrouped and simplified Spot’s design to improve his look and character messaging. This included changing the design of the spots. “We went with just having the one spot on his face, which changes shapes a couple times,” Hawkins said. “Sometimes it shoots out some particles when he is yelling at Miles [Shameik Moore]. But we wanted to really boil him down to his essence, which is just the bareness of his black-and-white design and the spots. And then use that to live within those boundaries.”The process of Spot learning to control his spots wasn’t always written into the scenes, so they honed in on that during an early action sequence, where he accidentally learns how to throw a portal. “And then that way it makes sense when he throws them with more control later in the film,” added Hawkins. “So, if he gets angry, they spin or move much faster.”In the beginning, when Spot’s out of control, he ends up in his own little pocket dimension without any spots. Then, when he recreates a Collider and starts traveling from dimension to dimension, he becomes all black when the spots overtake his body, transforming into an abyss-like character.“Oftentimes, we would explore [anarchic] deformations,” Hawkins said. “But sometimes they would go in the wrong direction and he would end up looking more like a creature than a person. It was important that he still be the person that he is, not like this mindless beast.”For Lasker, Spot, in particular, provided an opportunity to test out many more novel techniques “with tools upon tools upon tools to build up to him. But everything was layered with a lot of stuff, and the artists had to learn how to use all these tools, which was a real testament to the artistry.”A Sony Pictures Animation release, “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse″ is now in theaters.",

        "title": "Oscar Isaac Wants Pedro Pascal to Voice an ‘Old, Cranky Spider-Person’ in a ‘Spider-Verse’ Movie",
        "content": "Pedro Pascal has appeared in many of Hollywood’s biggest franchises over the past decade, showing up in everything from “Game of Thrones” to “Star Wars” before landing his now-iconic role in “The Last of Us.” But there’s one superstar rite of passage that has evaded him: a role in a superhero franchise. Fortunately, Oscar Isaac thinks he might have a solution for that.In a new interview with British GQ to promote his role as Spider-Man 2099 in “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” Isaac was asked about other actors that he’d like to see join Phil Lord and Chris Miller’s animated multiverse franchise. While Isaac made it clear that he has complete confidence in the series’ casting directors to find the right fits, he singled out Pascal as a possible voice for a geriatric web slinger.“They’re so brilliant at finding the right person for the right character, but maybe Pedro Pascal,” Isaac said. “Let’s find something for him. He should be a Spider-Person, like a cranky, old Spider-Person.”Fans probably shouldn’t get their hopes up just yet, as Pascal won’t have a chance to join the Spider-Verse until at least the fourth film in the series. “Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse” is already close to completion and is set to complete the story begun in “Across the Spider-Verse” when it opens next year.It’s very nice of Isaac to try and find a role for his buddy — but at this point, another fan-favorite role in a kid-friendly franchise might be the last thing Pascal needs. The “Last of Us” star has joked about his occasional discomfort with his newfound fame on multiple occasions. In his “Saturday Night Live” opening monologue, he famously complained that he always feels creepy when he’s asked to demonstrate his “Mandalorian” voice for fans he encounters in public.“It’s an honor to be a part of these huge franchises like ‘Game of Thrones’ and ‘Star Wars,’ but I’m still getting used to people recognizing me,” he said. “The other day, some guy stopped me on the street and said, ‘My son loves “The Mandalorian.”‘ And the next thing I know I’m FaceTiming with this six-year-old who has no idea who I am because my character wears a mask for the entire show.”",

        "title": "Celine Song Dissects That Amazing Final Shot in ‘Past Lives’",
        "content": "[Editor’s note: The following interview contains spoilers for “Past Lives.”]The whole time rookie filmmaker Celine Song was shooting “Past Lives” in New York, she knew she had to finish up her location exteriors with the ultimate shot of the movie. The camera follows friends since childhood Nora (Greta Lee) and Hae Sung (Teo Yoo), as they walk along a Village street. They say good-bye. He grabs an Uber. And then she walks all the way back to her apartment, where her husband Arthur (John Magaro) sits on the stoop. It’s filmed in one long take. Six minutes and 26 seconds, to be exact.“I remember when we were location scouting, and we found this street,” Song told IndieWire, “I remember telling everybody in my crew, ‘so this scene is the hill that we’re all going to die on. So we’re going to have to figure out how to do this in a way that we’re going to put everything we have against it, because if this doesn’t work, none of the movie works.”It was late in the shoot, before they moved onto a soundstage. They had spent two nights filming the pivotal bar scene that inspired the film, as Nora translates between her American husband and her childhood sweetheart. “So the actors were emotionally in the perfect place to be able to shoot that scene,” said Song. “So that was a way that you can make that scene easier in some ways. Even though of course, the technical part of it is complicated, because you are trying to claim the location for the whole street.”Half a block in New York City is a fair distance, especially in the East Village. “So if you move truly one foot to one side,” said Song, “we’re gonna run right into the zoo that is the East Village on Friday night. And it was it was pretty miraculous the way we were able to get it. And when we were talking about it, we knew that we wanted to do this walk. But my DP [Shabier Kirchner] asked me which direction that they should walk, and then she would walk back home. And I said, ‘Of course, it should go from right to left, it’s the past.’ If you look at it as a timeline, you’re walking towards a spot in the past, you’re walking Hae Sung back, and you stop there. And then she has to linger for 45 seconds. I was queuing it with my hand. I was queuing the Uber, it’s like, ‘perfect, this feels right, let’s go.'”They were shooting in 35mm. “So we had to change the mag [film magazine] every time,” she said. “We would do one, and then it would change. And she would dwell there after he’s left and he has to leave back into her past. And then she’s going to pause and then she’s going to turn and push herself towards the present and the future. Right. So she has to go the other way. And then where her present is, where her future is, there is Arthur sitting there on the stoop, which is her home, too.”Song was blessed with some on-set kismet. “A couple of miraculous things happened,” she said. “There was this piece of wind, that would be blowing in the direction towards the past and where the Uber was going to drive away. And we didn’t have a wind machine. ‘Oh my God,’ we were trying to figure out this scene so much that we had not thought about the possibility of wind. But the wind just showed up. That’s just a pure filmmaking miracle. And then I knew that when she was walking home, she has to cry, but she’s not crying for the whole of the film. So this is the moment that she’s alone for the first time almost in the film. And she is able to allow herself to grieve like that. That walk is about the grief for the little girl that she never got to grieve. It’s not about, ‘oh my god, I wish I went with with Hae Sung,’ it’s more about the girl.”The movie isn’t about Nora picking one man over the other. “No, never,” said Song. “And once Hae Sung has gone, the next shot, the final shot is him in the car. And he’s of course going from left to right. So he has to find his own way to move forward too because until then he hasn’t been able to. It was good for him. And he finally was able to close that door. So to me, and when I was talking to Teo the actor about what he should look like as he was getting driven away by Uber, the easier thing is for him is to feel self pity or melancholic, or sad. But actually, I was like, ‘No, you should look like you’re at peace, and you’re glad, and you’re exhausted, but in a great way, like the way you’re going to feel once you’ve made this movie.”An A24 release, “Past Lives” is now in theaters.",

        "title": "‘Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse’ and ‘Past Lives’: The Portrait of a Healthy, Happy Box Office",
        "content": "“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” (Sony) is this summer’s first movie to exceed expectations and not a moment too soon, as the season’s total lags behind 2022. With $120.5 million, Sony’s animated Marvel sequel has grossed 60 percent of the 2018 original. That’s double what advance tracking indicated just over a week ago.One reason was a terrific critical response, with an 87 Metacritic score that stands as the best for a wide studio release since “Little Women” in December 2019. It opened the same day as “Past Lives” (A24), which has the year’s best Metacritic score of 92 and now stands as the second-best specialized per-theater average of over $58,000, grossing $232,266 in four New York/Los Angeles theaters. (“Beau Is Afraid” reached $80,000).“Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3” and “The Little Mermaid” saw respectable debuts that didn’t reach the heights of their precedents, but “Spider-Verse” had additional advantages.The original “Spider-Verse” was a surprise success in 2018. It faced uncertainty in how Marvel would translate to animation, but the result was a domestic gross of just under $200 million, about double expectations. It opened on a normally dead mid-December weekend with $35 million, sustained a strong run through the holidays, and won the Oscar for Animated Feature.Since then, 2021’s “Spider-Man: No Way Home” became the biggest grossing domestic release since 2019. Factor in the very strong reviews along with the goodwill from the first film, and the only surprising element becomes the film’s initial lowball projections.It suggests an eager audience for a critically acclaimed film that promises a fun experience. (The former is not a necessity — see: “Super Mario Bros.” — but it can help.) If that formula holds true, there’s reason for optimism in highly anticipated upcoming titles like “Barbie,” “The Flash” and “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning: Part 1.”“Spider-Verse” starts with an additional $88 million foreign take, for $208.6 million worldwide. Key territories Japan, China, and South Korea have yet to open. It would take a very strong hold for this to approach $1 billion, especially among potentially intense summer competition. For Sony it’s all good: With a reported $100 million production cost, the film’s profit margin is in far better shape than “Guardians,” “Fast X,” and “Mermaid.” Each of those titles cost between $200 million- $300 million+ in reported production costs, and all head to total grosses of $850 million or less.“The Boogeyman” (Disney) also opened, reaching #3 with $12.3 million. The Fox production cost a modest $35 million. Its theatrical release suggests that Disney is downplaying streaming premieres and the gross is about $2 million better than the similar “Barbarian” last September. With great word-of-mouth, “Barbarian” went on to an impressive four-times multiple to reach $40 million.Disney’s “Mermaid” at #2 dropped more than expected at 58 percent (“Aladdin” in 2019 fell 53 percent), but “Spider-Verse” likely played a part. The film’s bigger problem is its weak foreign showing of $141 million to $186 million domestic. This could struggle to reach $500 million worldwide — not the anticipated result for a $250 million film.At #4, Disney’s “Guardians” passed $322 million domestic and now stands at $780 million worldwide. That’s decent for sure, but again below the $1 billion normally assumed for the first Marvel summer release.It beat out “Fast X,” which dropped 60 percent in its third weekend. In three weeks, the latest installment of the Vin Diesel franchise (with a reported $340 million production cost) has grossed slightly more than “Spider-Verse” did in three days. “Fast X” foreign stands at $475 million, but the combined number of $603 million is far short of its goal.This weekend looks like about $204 million total. That places it just behind Easter weekend with its “SMB” debut as best for 2023. It betters both last year ($177 million) and 2019 ($173 million). Year to date is steady at 28 percent above 2022; if sustained, it would lead to around $9.5 billion. The four-week rolling comparison to 2019 rises to 88 percent.The “Past Lives” debut is a specialized-distribution godsend. Its platform placement amid elevated media cheerleading positioned it well, but you might have said the same about “The Fabelmans,” “The Banshees of Inisherin,” and “TÁR;” all opened to per-theater averages under $50,000. A24’s “Aftersun,” opened to $60,000 in four theaters.Platform openings like this don’t guarantee crossover success. A24’s “The Whale” opened to $352,000 in six; buttressed by a Christmas expansion and star Brendan Fraser’s Oscar, it crossed $17 million.A24 will move more slowly with a three-stage expansion, reaching wide release June 23. Even $10 million would be a significant achievement.1.

        "content": "In what has to be seen as a blow to solidarity with the writers who’ve been striking since the start of May 2023, the Directors Guild of America has reached a tentative agreement with the AMPTP that will avert a strike of its own.The DGA‘s new three-year collective bargaining agreement with the studios appears to satisfy the guild’s demands for appropriate compensation related to streaming residuals and the international distribution of their work, as well as offer new protections for creative rights (including against AI) and safety issues.The deal still needs to be presented to the DGA’s National Board, but includes these highlights:“We have concluded a truly historic deal,” said Jon Avnet, chair of the DGA’s Negotiations Committee, in an official statement. “It provides significant improvements for every Director, Assistant Director, Unit Production Manager, Associate Director and Stage Manager in our Guild. In these negotiations we made advances on wages, streaming residuals, safety, creative rights and diversity, as well as securing essential protections for our members on new key issues like artificial intelligence – ensuring DGA members will not be replaced by technological advances. This deal would not have been possible without the unity of the DGA membership, and we are grateful for the strong support of union members across the industry.”“This deal recognizes the future of our industry is global and respects the unique and essentialrole of directors and their teams as we move into that future,” said Lesli Linka Glatter, President of the DGA, in a statement. “As each new technology brings about major change, this deal ensures that each of the DGA’s 19,000 members can share in the success we all create together.”When the DGA made a similar deal in January 2008, it was widely believed to be a move toward forcing the then striking Writers Guild of America to resolve its own demands to the studios in a less satisfactory way for its membership. However, SAG-AFTRA has not announced any agreement with the studios in its own collective bargaining agreement renegotiation, which will likely be more fraught than the DGA’s given the critical threat of AI to actors’ rights to their own image and performances. It’s possible then that the DGA deal won’t have the same effect on pushing the writers to accept a lesser deal.",

        "title": "Tom Hanks Says Robert Zemeckis Shot ‘Forrest Gump’ Scenes Like ‘I Love Lucy’ to Combat His Exhaustion",
        "content": "Forrest Gump lived a famously full life. Perhaps a little too full, if you ask Tom Hanks.Appearing on a panel at The New Yorker Live this week, the actor recalled the extensive travel that was required for the role that won him his second Oscar. As Hanks remembers it, the grueling process of filming the montage of Forrest running across America made it difficult for him to show up for the film‘s most important scenes.“I was so exhausted because we had shot twenty-seven days straight,” Hanks said. “Remember how Forrest ran across the country? Well, there’s only one way to get those scenes, in those days. You had to fly to the goddamn place, put on the costume, run for an hour and a half, then go back, get on the plane, and then fly to, say, New Hampshire, and do it all over again. So I’m exhausted. I don’t know what’s going on. The scenes on the park bench have oceans of dialogue, and we shot them in a day and a half.”Hanks revealed that he was seriously concerned about his ability to remember all of his monologues in his exhausted state.“I said to Bob — the director, Robert Zemeckis — ‘Bob, my head is fragile, frazzled. We’re doing all these scenarios with different people, and every one of them has a page and a half of dialogue. I will never be able to keep this in my head.’”Fortunately, his director had a plan. Hanks said that Zemeckis opted to shoot certain scenes in the style of a multi-camera sitcom, getting multiple angles at the same time and allowing Hanks to rely on cue cards, in order to speed things up for his leading man.“‘Oh, don’t worry, Tom. We’ll shoot it like ‘I Love Lucy.’ We’ll have four cameras. We’ll put the words up on cards if you need it. You can just read ’em,’” Hanks recalled Zemeckis saying to him. “I said, ‘Oh, great, thank you. Let’s make this an even more artificial atmosphere!’”Hanks’ concerns ended up being unfounded and “Forrest Gump” became one of his most recognizable roles (it presumably isn’t on the list of movies that he hates). While the actor said that he didn’t know if the film would be a hit while they worked on it, he admires Zemeckis for being willing to take creative risks on the film.“And so Bob Zemeckis, God bless him — I’ve worked with him more than once — landed on the absolute truth of anybody who has gone forward and said, ‘We are going to commit something to film today,’” Hanks said. “You do not know if it is going to work out. You can only have faith.”",

        "title": "Tom Holland Says ‘Into the Spider-Verse’ Is ‘the Best Spider-Man Movie Ever Made’",
        "content": "Anyone who spent the past week counting down the minutes before they could see “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” should know that they’re not alone. The sequel to the Oscar-winning “Into the Spider-Verse” has all the makings of a runaway box office hit, and many believe it could end up being a cultural phenomenon on the level of 2021’s “Spider-Man: No Way Home.” One of the live-action Spider-Men certainly has faith in it.Speaking to the Associated Press while promoting his new Apple TV+ series “The Crowded Room,” Tom Holland expressed his excitement about the animated sequel. He even revealed that the original “Into the Spider-Verse” is his favorite film about the web-slinging hero that made him a superstar.“I think the first ‘Spider-Verse’ movie is the best Spider-Man movie that’s ever been made,” Holland said. “I’m so proud of everyone involved. [Producer] Amy Pascal is like my mom. I was supposed to go with her [to the premiere] as her date, I couldn’t go because I’m here working. But I’m incredibly proud of them, I’m excited for the second one. I’m sure it will live up to every expectation, and I can’t wait to see it.”Whenever Holland gets around to seeing “Across the Spider-Verse,” it appears that he’s in for a good time. Critics have overwhelmingly praised the sequel for expanding the creative sandbox that the first film established while setting up plenty of excitement for the second half of the story (which will be told in next year’s “Beyond the Spider-Verse”).“’Into the Spider-Verse’ was astute and funny, complicated and emotional, unique and daring, and its sequel only grows and expands on those aims. If the first film showed what superhero movies could be, ‘Across the Spider-Verse’ goes even further: It shows what they should be,” IndieWire’s Kate Erbland wrote in her review of the film. “In a genre built on the literally super and special, these films are unafraid to stand out and do something truly different, something that pushes the limits, to show the genuine range available to this subset of stories and feel damn good in the process (and look, dare we say, even better).”“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” is now playing in theaters.",

        "title": "’Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse’ Hints at the Future of Creativity Well Beyond Hollywood",
        "content": "Kohn’s Corner is a weekly column about the challenges and opportunities of sustaining American film culture.It can be a dispiriting experience, I’ve learned, to emerge from the Cannes Film Festival and reenter a world where original cinematic achievements barely have room to breathe. Last week, I was sifting through new work from Jonathan Glazer and Nuri Bilge Ceylan in the south of France while “The Little Mermaid” dominated the U.S. box office — and came home from the festival to find that for most people, this costly live-action simulation of a 30-year-old property was all the movies had to offer the world at the moment. But a funny thing just happened at the multiplex. I don’t exactly buy into the fan-based hysteria proclaiming “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” as the greatest superhero movie ever, but the innovations of this newly released animated sequel extend well beyond its overstuffed multiverse plot. From a pure storytelling standpoint, “Across the Spider-verse” certainly hits the same poignant beats as its predecessor, and then some, supplanting the canonization of Peter Parker with the more rough-and-tumble New York experiences of Miles Morales and his Puerto Rican family. It’s funny, touching, and loaded with absorbing action sequences. However, the most exciting aspect of “Spider-verse” has less to do with franchise revisionism than the visual language it deploys in that process. I lost track of the number of times that directors Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, and Justin K. Thompson changed up the images throughout. Even more than its predecessor, the movie eschews the backdrops of many characters for vivid color schemes to reflect their moods. It keeps evolving in front of our eyes, replicating comic book vernacular but also transcending its boundaries. If you’re well-versed in experimental cinema, this kind of rapid-fire shifting of palettes might not seem so radical, but there’s a certain thrill to be found in the notion that millions of audiences can sit comfortably with a disruption of narrative continuity that once seemed more at home in the work of the late Stan Brakhage than anything in the MCU. How does “Across the Spider-Verse” get away with it? Part of it has to do with familiar stakes that ground the scenario despite its ever-shifting imagery, but it’s also proof of a broader cultural orientation around fragmented storytelling that today’s audiences have adapted as part of their daily audiovisual experience, thanks to the onslaught of moving images that most people experience on an array of screens. During multiple appearances at Cannes this year, jury president Ruben Östlund referred more than once to an LDV Capital study reporting that there were 45 billion cameras around the world by the end of last year. When everyone is an amateur image-maker, their relationship to images changes.If most people can scroll endlessly through TikTok without a sense of disorientation, it follows that mainstream entertainment should adapt to that level of comfort as well. I saw “Spider-Verse” at a promotional screening for Dolby technology prefaced by the same dazzling trailer the company has used for years to illustrate its technology, but it has a fascinating new context today as audiences seem less engaged by familiar storytelling tropes than a new kind of cinema of attractions. The paradigm has gone from “tell me a story” to “show me what you’ve got,” and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Empty-headed CGI spectacles still proliferate (hello, “Fast X”!), but “Spider-Verse” suggests an emerging appetite for more sophisticated image-based experiences produced at the studio level. Yet what I found most intriguing about the visual stimuli of “Spider-Verse” was that it didn’t make the case for that big scale at all. In the five years since “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” came out, the ability to craft imaginative high-quality images has accelerated at a historic rate, thanks in large part to the public’s embrace of generative AI. It may be a controversial talking point at the center of the WGA strike, but generative AI has democratized image-making in such a remarkable way that artists with far fewer resources than the “Spider-Verse” team can craft visuals of a similar caliber. If you’re a creator and haven’t yet messed around with Midjourney or DALL-E to see what I mean, stop what you’re doing right now and get to it. The possibilities are astonishing — and they have arrived alongside an expanding comfort with experimental storytelling approaches. As much as “Across the Spider-Verse” captures the current moment, it’s also a snapshot of what the future might look like, well beyond Hollywood’s confines. We’ve seen inventive lo-fi approaches to animated storytelling many times over the years. The 2007 fantasy effort “We Are the Strange” was made with a wide array of homemade CG effects by the artist M dot Strange all by himself. Now, however, the tools have grown sophisticated to the point where such DIY world-building can happen at a much faster pace, with far better results.Last year, I wrote about how “Avatar: The Way of Water” should inspire a revolution in low-budget FX, given the cascading price point for motion-capture technology. This is also true for animation and, as an extension, any kind of cinematic storytelling aiming for visual ingenuity.The alarmist tone that surrounds virtually every aspect of AI these days may not be altogether unwarranted, but it obscures how much aesthetic opportunity has materialized right on schedule. Of course, not every movie has Spider-Man as a Trojan Horse to draw audiences into the fold. But if they’re willing to accept a superhero movie on these terms, who knows what else they might embrace? Whatever happens with the industry, the pathway for rapid-fire creative ingenuity has never been more pronounced. As usual, I welcome feedback to this week’s column: eric@indiewire.com",

        "title": "‘Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse’ Even Bucks the Usual Post-Credits Scene Trend",
        "content": "[Editor’s note: The following post contains spoilers for both “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” and its post-credits, well, kind of scenes.]At this point in our collective superhero-moviegoing lives, staying put through reams of post-film credits has become second nature (worth noting: it’s also just good manners, a sign of respect to the hundreds and thousands of people who made a film, but that’s a debate for another time). The movie isn’t really over until we get one, two, three, four, maybe even five zippy little additions and winking nods to what’s to come next in the grand ol’ churn of blockbuster franchises. (Heck, even the final “Guardians of the Galaxy” feature got two of them!)But what if — and just stay with me here — a highly anticipated, already lauded, and distinctly original superhero feature did away with that ingrained expectation? To put it more bluntly: don’t worry about sticking around for post-credits scenes in “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” because there aren’t any.Wait, what?[One more warning: The following post contains spoilers for both “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” and its post-credits, well, kind of scenes.]No, there are no post-credits scenes in the film, a break with the recent tradition of not just this particular genre, but even this mini-franchise (the first film included two post-credits scenes, one that paid tribute to both Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, and one that introduced the Oscar Isaac-voiced Miguel O’Hara AKA Spider-Man 2099, who does indeed play a major role in the second film). This time around, no such luck.And yet, the final credits of “Across the Spider-Verse” do still provide some very necessary context for what’s next for our Miles Morales, mostly thanks to a single line that tells us “Miles Morales Will Return in ‘Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse.'” It’s the kind of note we’re used to seeing at the end of most superhero stories, a fairly obvious way to remind people, hey, these adventures certainly aren’t over yet!, but it’s of particular importance to “Across the Spider-Verse,” which ends on a hell of a cliffhanger and with a ton of loose ends.One of the loosest of all? That “Across the Spider-Verse” is very much one-half of a planned two-film series. As I wrote in my review of the film, “The decision to split the sequel into two films seems to have been lost on plenty of fans. [Phil] Lord and [Chris] Miller announced the two-part sequel, complete with ‘Part One’ and ‘Part Two’ title addendums, back in December 2021. By April 2022, the two films had been renamed ‘Across the Spider-Verse’ and ‘Beyond the Spider-Verse,’ a move that seems to have caused the bulk of the confusion. Even in this critic’s well-attended screening, the end reveal that this story is very much not over was met with cocked heads.”For once, that “will return” message seemed necessary (and welcome!) indeed.As IndieWire’s Bill Desowitz noted in his interview with directors Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, and Justin K. Thompson, “the producers and directors realized early on that there was too much story to pack into one film, so they split it into two parts and formed a trilogy. But the element they worked on the most was how to tell a complete story with a proper arc for the middle section in the tradition of “The Empire Strikes Back.”“What questions are we gonna leave unanswered?” Dos Santos said. “In my personal experience, whenever there’s a trilogy, I tend to love the middle movies because you can be a little bit darker and you can push things a lot more narratively.”For Spidey fans, that means this adventure is very much not over, and will wrap up with the release of “Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse” on March 29, 2024. Perhaps that film will return to the world of the post-credits scene? Who cares, really, as long as they keep making entire films this good.A Sony Pictures Animation release, “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse″ is now in theaters.",

        "title": "The Best Danny Elfman Songs, from ‘Jack’s Lament’ to ‘The Simpsons’ Theme",
        "content": "Where were you when the best Coachella set since Beyoncé happened? When Danny Elfman took the stage of Coachella shirtless on April 2022 to perform music from his band Oingo Boingo as well as the scores of “A Nightmare Before Christmas,” “Edward Scissorhands,” and — of course — “The Simpsons,” it set Twitter afire. The sometimes goofy, undeniably epic performance was a delight that reminded people of a universal fact: Danny Elfman rocks.Elfman made his film composing debut in 1980 with “Forbidden Zone,” which was directed by his brother Richard Elfman and was based on the work of Danny’s experimental musical theater group “The Mystic Knights of Oingo Boingo.” The Mystic Knights were soon reformed into the (somewhat) more conventional new wave band Oingo Boingo, and their music found a fan in director Tim Burton, who recruited Elfman to score his feature debut “Pee-wee’s Big Adventure.” From there, a partnership was formed, and Elfman’s scored most of Burton’s works since, including iconic themes for films like “Scissorhands,” “Batman,” and “Beetlejuice.”Composing quickly became Elfman’s main gig, and he would retire Oingo Boingo in 1995. His non-Burton works include the scores for the first two “Spider-Man” films, “Dick Tracy,” the first “Mission: Impossible,” all of the “Men in Black” films, and Henry Selick’s “Nightmare Before Christmas,” which also featured him as the singing voice for Jack Skellington. Elfman has bafflingly never won an Oscar, but he does have two Emmys for his work on the “Desperate Housewives” theme.One of Elfman’s most recent projects saw him reunite with Burton for “Wednesday,” an “Addams Family” spinoff that sees Jenna Ortega play the famously emotionless teenager as she develops psychic powers and heads to boarding school. Elfman composed the score for the outrageously popular Netflix series, and he’s one of the creative team members set for IndieWire’s annual Consider This Event ahead of this year’s Emmys. Joining him on a panel of Netflix crafts professionals is his “Wednesday” co-composer Chris Bacon and music supervisor Jen Malone, as well as members of the “Beef” and “Stranger Things” teams.Here’s a look at the 13 best songs Elfman has written for screens big and small, ranging from musical numbers in “The Nightmare Before Christmas” and “Corpse Bride” to the main theme of “The Simpsons.” Entries are listed chronologically, and selections have been limited to one track per title.With editorial contributions by Christian Blauvelt and Christian Zilko.It’s no wonder Tim Burton’s fiendishly fun “Beetlejuice” became a Tony-nominated musical. Like “Heathers” and “Mean Girls” before it, the film boasts a kitschy, color-blocked crassness that’s already so heightened you can’t help but accept “once more with rhymes!” as justification for cultural double-dipping. But even if the Broadway show was nothing more than an excuse to give someone other than Michael Keaton a shot at the title role, the musical legacy of “Beetlejuice” exists because of Elfman. His brilliance is arguably best captured in its title song foreshadowing the demise of one Mr. and Mrs. Maitland.The composer’s second collaboration with Burton is a fitful, brass-heavy balancing act: a discordant combination of ghostly choirs, syncopated cymbals, and screeching strings. The title music is as inviting and outrageous as a circus interlude but enjoys a minor cynicism that makes even that tiny sample of Harry Belafonte’s “Day-o” chilling. There’s restraint in Elfman’s conducting — but also a lurking power worth listening to one, two, maybe even three times. —AFWhen people think of Danny Elfman, the immediate association is with the haunting, gothic work he’s produced for Tim Burton. But one of the composer’s most iconic songs is so divorced from the tone people expect from Elfman that it’s easy to forget he wrote it at all. For over 30 years, every episode of “The Simpsons” has opened with Elfman’s legendary theme, an orchestral number that captures the frenetic, fast-paced comedy of the show at its very best. Elfman wrote the number after series creator Matt Groening showed him a rough cut of the equally famous opening sequence, and aimed for a retro feel — which shows in the ear worm opening, featuring a chorus of voices singing the title of the animated series in a way that’s impossible to get out of your head.There’s so many small touches to admire in the theme, like the space it leaves for Lisa’s epic (and constantly changing) saxophone riff towards the middle of the full opening. But it’s also so ingrained in the minds of anyone who’s ever watched the show that trying to view it objectively is like trying to critique Pomp and Circumstance: it’s simply a classic. —WCWhen that brass section, playing low, slow-builds to a crescendo to open “The Batman Theme,” punctuated by orchestral bells, Danny Elfman was able to create a sense of dread for the brooding Dark Knight and, other than John Williams’ “Superman” theme, the most iconic music for a superhero ever. If Williams captured the sense of flying with his music, Elfman bottled the feeling of a breakneck chase over rain-slicked pavement with flickering streetlamps. There’s even the hint of an organ in his wall of sound, to add a touch of the Gothic to his noir soundscape. No wonder it’s been repeated and copied endlessly, including by Elfman himself, who remixed it to become the theme for “Batman: The Animated Series” (before that was replaced by a theme from Shirley Walker). He then brought the theme back for the much maligned “Justice League” movie, along with Williams’ “Superman” theme, to add an additional bit of gravitas for Ben Affleck’s portrayal of the Caped Crusader. —CBElfman has called the score for “Edward Scissorhands” one of his personal favorites, and it’s easy to see why: the entire score is a majestic achievement, with sweeping epic compositions that give the heartbreaking tragic romance its heart and soul. And Elfman’s score only builds in complexity and beauty throughout the movie, until it peaks with the stunning final track, a lovely and somber piece that builds to an epic choral finish. —WCThe original “Evil Dead” trilogy is a study of a franchise gradually learning to let go of its seriousness. “Evil Dead 2″ used its larger budget to blow up (and arguably improve on) the ridiculously gory format of its microbudget predecessor, but “Army of Darkness” was the film that truly cemented its status as a camp horror series. The film’s medieval setting (and anachronistic chainsaw massacres) remains a love-it-or-hate it point of contention among Deadites, but there’s no denying that Elfman’s musical contributions helped sell it. While he did not score the entire film, Elfman kicked off his lifelong collaboration with Sam Raimi by providing the iconic “March of the Dead” theme. Elfman combines the pomp and circumstance of John Williams’ “Imperial March” with the unsettling nature of the best John Carpenter slasher scores to create the perfect backdrop for an influx of zombies. —CZRead IndieWire’s guide to the Evil Dead franchise.The vast majority of people are more familiar with Elfman’s instrumental music than they are with the former Oingo Boingo frontman’s voice. And those who have heard Elfman singing are most likely to have heard him in “The Nightmare Before Christmas,” where he provided the magnificent singing for main character Jack Skellington (whose speaking lines were delivered by Chris Sarandon). The goth stop-motion operetta is filled to the brim with Elfman’s impeccable songs, but his best singing moment might be the early number “Jack’s Lament.” A classic “I Want” song twisted into a more melancholy form, the song sees Jack lament his boredom over the routines of Halloween. Elfman both sings and acts it well, perfectly conveying the bone deep sadness driving Jack. —WCYes, the song everyone remembers from “Men in Black” is the rap song from star Will Smith. But Elfman’s score for the film garnered him his very first Oscar nomination, and deservedly so. It’s a fun departure from what we’ve come to expect from a Elfman score, with some electronic elements mixed in with his typical orchestral work to fit the vibe of the blockbuster. His main theme is particularly awesome, using a pulsing drum beat to set the tone for an awesome sci-fi adventure. —WCElfman brought the orchestral bells back for Sam Raimi’s first Spider-Man movie, but this time he was going for a theme that unabashedly conveyed heroism, with a dash of romance and melancholy too. This might be the best use of French horns since Luke’s theme in the original “Star Wars”? The horns power those cascading notes of Spidey’s main theme throughout the movie, but return at an especially powerful moment: when Tobey Maguire’s Peter Parker tells MJ (Kirsten Dunst) that “all I have to give” is to be her friend, not something more, and he walks away. Then the horns power up as he narrates, “Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: With great power comes great responsibility. This is my gift… my curse.” Cut to Spidey swinging through the canyons of New York as a chorus chimes in. Cut to everyone in the audience having chills. —CB“A grown man just constantly lies to his son” might not seem like the elevator pitch for a masterpiece, but “Big Fish” might be the most moving film of Tim Burton’s career. The loving exploration of the way parents use their children as captive audiences to re-contextualize their own lives succeeds in part because it treats Edward Bloom’s tall tales with so much respect. All of the fairy tales that he tells his son are captured on film with the same cinematic gravitas that he imagined them with in a quest to blur the line between fantasy and reality. So it’s fitting that Elfman’s score takes a similar approach, backing up Edward’s exaggerations with sweeping, triumphant tunes that match his enthusiasm for his own (made-up) life. The title theme is so majestic that you’d never expect you were getting ready to listen to a bunch of fibs. The fusion of Elfman’s understanding of the narrative and his musical artistry earned him his third Oscar nomination for Best Original Score. —CZPlay this back to back with “The Simpsons” theme and you’ll find, not repetition, but the perfect complementary pairing. Where “Simpsons” is pure orchestral anarchy from the start, the “Desperate Housewives” theme, electronic, builds to a spinning-top frenzy, like the tension a group of suburban moms standing together might feel, worried about whether their kids might injure themselves in a bouncy house. It’s a musical expression of one’s blood pressure rising, maybe as one grips a basket of blueberry muffins a little too white-knuckle hard. —CBTim Burton’s “Corpse Bride” pales in comparison to “The Nightmare Before Christmas,” visually, narratively, and musically. And yet, Elfman eeks out a strong smattering of tunes for the still under-appreciated 2005 stop-motion work. For the ghostly romance, starring Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp, Elfman coughed up the tragicomic “Tears to Shed” — sung by a spider, a worm, and the corpse they inhabit — plus two vivacious ensemble numbers in “According to Plan” (sung above ground) and “The Wedding Song” (sung below it). Not to mention, there are a selection of great piano instrumentals.But the best song is — of course — the one Elfman actually performs on. He lends his voice to undead lounge singer Bonejangles for the jazzy backstory track “Remains of the Day,” scatting his way through a “Seussical”-esque animation sequence that’ll make you want a martini and anatomy chart. It’s the most clever “Corpse Bride” gets by a mile, with its unimpeachable technical precision punctuated by a homey simplicity and delightful silliness. (“This is gonna be good!“) —AFThe chaotic relationship at the heart of “Silver Linings Playbook” is tumultuous even by David O. Russell standards. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence star as a recently-institutionalized divorcee and a young widow whose mental illness is less diagnosed but no less real. Their endlessly angry, horny, and generally messy attempts to free themselves from the emotional strangleholds of past relationships and start something new together is tough to watch at times, but it ends with something resembling contentment. The calm after the storm is flawlessly encapsulated by Elfman’s denouement piece “Happy Ending,” a pairing of a minimalistic piano composition and choral arrangements that gives everyone a chance to catch their breath. It’s not so much a happy ending as a signal that a beginning is finally possible — and a high point of Elfman’s ongoing collaboration with Russell. —CZElfman’s aesthetic is so creepily, kookily, altogether ookily perfect for “The Addams Family” that it’s a wonder it took him so long to write the score for an iteration of the franchise. When he did, it was with “Wednesday,” the Netflix series introduced the classic characters for a younger generation. His main theme for the show brings all of the elements we’d expect from both an “Addams Family” score and an Elfman score — choral voices, spooky pianos and violins, a suitably gothic vibe — but it’s complemented by a harder metallic edge, with thumping drums that bring the property firmly into the 21st century. —WC",

        "title": "Tom Cruise’s ‘Mission: Impossible’ Trying to Kick Christopher Nolan Off of Premium Screens",
        "content": "Everyone expects a same-day box-office battle between “Barbie” (Warner Bros.) and “Oppenheimer” (Universal) on July 21, but the real contention may lie between “Oppenheimer” and a film that opens 10 days earlier, Tom Cruise‘s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” (Paramount Pictures, July 12).A new report in Puck claimed that Cruise has personally called rival studio executives and exhibitors in hopes of convincing them to relinquish PLF (premium large-format) screens that may have planned to show “Oppenheimer” and show “M:I 7” instead. Beyond the visual impact those screens provide, they also come with an upcharge that can add millions to the box office — especially for an action spectacle like a seventh “Mission: Impossible” movie.Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” his first film for Universal after parting ways with longtime partner Warner Bros., will take over all IMAX screens in North America for three weeks, bumping “Mission: Impossible” from auditoriums. (Unlike “M:I 7,” “Oppenheimer” was shot entirely on IMAX large-format cameras.) Audiences will line up to see the Oscar-nominated filmmaker’s recreation of an atomic bomb without CGI on the biggest screen possible. Cruise’s death-defying stunts in which he once again outdoes himself will, too, want to be seen in large formats. (Let’s also note that “Oppenheimer’s running time hits 3 hours; the new “Mission: Impossible” clocks in at 2 hours and 43 minutes.)Universal and Paramount declined comment. Warner Bros. Discovery (which distributes “Barbie”) did not respond to calls at press time. Cruise’s representative also had no comment.Universal and Christopher Nolan claimed the July 21, 2023 date all the way back in October 2021 — back when the studio announced the film’s production. Nolan’s fondness for the third Friday in July is also well-established: It’s been a favored date for him ever since the days of “The Dark Knight” in 2008.For Cruise, it seems that’s not the same thing as a “no.” It’s not unusual for a producer to aggressively screen a movie for exhibitors, but it’s surprising to have a producer-star personally make entreaties to win back movie screens.An IMAX representative told IndieWire they’re fully committed to the three-week “Oppenheimer” plan, which constitutes about 1,550 of IMAX’s total 1,700 venues worldwide. (The atomic bomb epic still awaits dates in top markets China and Japan.) An IMAX takeover of this length is rare, although the company prioritizes films shot on its own cameras (such as “Oppenheimer”). “Avatar: The Way of Water” ran on IMAX screens for eight weeks starting last December, while “Dune: Part One,” even with a day-and-date HBO Max release, ran for three in 2021.Tickets for “Oppenheimer” went on on sale yesterday, days after the movie about the creator of the atomic bomb received an R rating (Nolan’s first since 2002’s “Insomnia” and 2000’s “Memento” before it). That might make it one of the widest IMAX openings for an R-rated movie ever. “Oppenheimer” comes with 11 miles of film stock and a $100 million production price tag ahead of print and advertising spends.At CinemaCon 2023, Paramount exhibitors revealed that the new “Mission: Impossible” would actually open two days earlier than scheduled, on July 12 instead, in an effort to drum up premium theater attendance and word-of-mouth as the summer movie season hits full swing. Tickets haven’t gone on sale for “M:I 7” yet, but both movies will need all the PLF help they can getAfter multiple COVID shutdowns on production, “M:I 7” production costs come in at $290 million for Paramount. The prior film in the franchise, “Fallout” from 2018, made $791 million worldwide on a budget of $178 million.Securing those IMAX and PLF screens made a big difference for something like “Avatar: The Way of Water,” which made over $250 million of its $2 billion total from IMAX screens alone.And while Cruise’s box-office haul for “Top Gun Maverick” ($1.493 billion globally) is in a league of its own, it was able to leg out in part because it had little box-office competition. Cruise surely has a chip on his shoulder; even Steven Spielberg told him earlier this year that he “saved Hollywood’s ass” with the “Top Gun” sequel after it became the largest post-pandemic grosser prior to “Avatar: The Way of Water.” That said, “Top Gun: Maverick” was pushed out of premium venues two weeks later by “Jurassic World Dominion” (Universal).The press spin ahead of the summer movie season has been that the same-date “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” will be the double-header to beat. But “Oppenheimer” and “M:I 7” arguably tick more boxes in four-quadrant audience appeal, especially among fanboys. “Dead Reckoning” will surely follow a similar trajectory as “Top Gun: Maverick,” but it faces a much more crowded summer.Tony Maglio and Tom Brueggemann contributed reporting.",

        "content": "Greta Gerwig wanted to live out her own personal pink-filled “Barbie” fantasy.The writer-director behind the highly anticipated live-action film based on the Mattel dolls detailed her vision behind the elaborate Barbie Dreamhouse that the titular doll (Margot Robbie) lives in. In fact, the over-the-top dedication to bringing the whimsical dolls to life led to an international pink paint shortage.“Maintaining the ‘kid-ness’ was paramount,” Gerwig told Architectural Digest. “I wanted the pinks to be very bright, and everything to be almost too much.”She added that the details were meant to capture what “made me love Barbie when I was a little girl.”Production designer Sarah Greenwood revealed that the production led to a shortage of the fluorescent shade of Rosco paint. “The world, ran out of pink,” Greenwood said. Greenwood previously told IndieWire that “pink became the film’s thesis” when designing the look of the ensemble film.Inspiration for the aesthetic of the Dreamhouse ranged from “Pee-wee’s Big Adventure” to “An American in Paris.” The architecture of the house itself was rooted in midcentury modernism found in Palm Springs. The set was constructed at the Warner Bros. Studios lot outside of London and included a hand-painted backdrop in lieu of CGI.“We were literally creating the alternate universe of Barbie Land,” Gerwig told AD. “Everything needed to be tactile, because toys are, above all, things you touch.”The “Little Women” auteur noted that “authentic artificiality” was key. “I wanted to capture what was so ridiculously fun about the Dreamhouses,” she said. “Why walk down stairs when you can slide into your pool? Why trudge up stairs when you take an elevator that matches your dress? There are no walls and no doors. Dreamhouses assume that you never have anything you wish was private — there is no place to hide.”For all the details on “Barbie,” click here.",

        "title": "Throwing a Dinner Party: The Art of Casting from the Experts",
        "content": "“There’s nothing worse than miscasting,” casting director Laura Rosenthal told IndieWire. Not that she speaks from her own experience. As Todd Haynes’ go-to casting director since “Far from Heaven,” Rosenthal has assembled some of the most memorable casts of the last few decades, including “The Kids Are All Right,” “A Quiet Place,” “Chicago,” and “Analyze This.”Now she and fellow acclaimed casting director Ellen Lewis — Jim Jarmusch and Martin Scorsese’s longtime casting director and the woman behind the casting of everything from “A League of Their Own” to “Killers of the Flower Moon” — are being honored by The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) with the retrospective series The Craft: Casting Directors Ellen Lewis and Laura Rosenthal, running June 1–16.The series highlights some of their most acclaimed work, as well as some films that may not be as well known. Among the offerings being screened are Scorsese’s “Goodfellas,” the Stanley Tucci-directed “Joe Gould’s Secret,” and Daisy von Scherler Mayer’s “Party Girl,” starring Parker Posey in one of her breakout roles.Lewis and Rosenthal spoke to IndieWire over the phone separately about their careers and the subtle craft of casting.As with so many other aspects of life, the COVID-19 pandemic sped up a reliance on technology in the casting industry. While many actors fear that Zoom auditions and self-tape submissions might reduce the intimacy of being in the room, Lewis thinks the process has simply shifted. “I think you can still make a very strong connection with people as long as you are looking at each other,” she said. “They can see you, you can see them. You are making sure that they’re not just getting on the Zoom when you’re immediately starting to read with them.” That attitude harkens back to a lesson Lewis learned as Juliet Taylor’s assistant, which Taylor passed on from Marion Dougherty, who invented the role of casting director alongside Lynn Stalmaster: Create a welcoming environment for all actors. “It’s very difficult to have to audition for roles and face constant rejection. And you want people to be the best that they can do,” Lewis said. Some of that is as simple as remaining receptive to an actor’s requests: “Ask if they need anything or answer questions if they have them.”  As Rosenthal pointed out, “If [COVID] happened a decade ago, I think the whole business would have been shut down. I don’t know how we would have done it. That’s the positive thing of technology, figuring it out. For me, I miss so much and I long for a certain in-person [casting process]. I’m so thankful we figured out a way to keep at it.” Director-actor combos have defined and elevated careers for decades, from John Ford and John Wayne, Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune, to Haynes and Julianne Moore. But similar relationships exist between actors and casting directors.“It’s a compliment when you really have an exciting relationship with an actor and you keep on working with them,” Rosenthal said. Rosenthal and Lewis both frequently bring in actors based on personal, long-term relationships. “Each of the films has their own world. You’re always being exposed to new actors who seem like they might be right for a period or for a world they’re creating,” Lewis said.“If you read a script and the part is fantastic, you think about really good actors that would embrace [it],” Rosenthal said. “Often it’s like, ‘Gosh, I haven’t seen them do this exactly. Maybe this would be appealing.’” It’s significant for casting directors to be open to the actors’ needs. Rosenthal thinks about “what’s in it for them? Why haven’t they tried it before? Maybe this is the right time to do it? Maybe they feel safe? Maybe who is directing? And it’s like, ‘Wow, I haven’t tried this before, but I feel safe with this director, and this is the right time for it.’”“I tend to keep my imagination open,” Lewis added. Ray Romano was best known for his sitcom “Everybody Loves Raymond” when his agent approached Lewis about the record company’s promotions head in HBO’s “Vinyl.” Initially unsure, she ended up casting Romano after he sent her a self-tape and nailed the role. Since then, Lewis has cast him as the head of a school board in “Bad Education,” Jimmy Hoffa’s attorney in “The Irishman,” and NASA’s deputy director in the upcoming Greg Berlanti film “Project Artemis.”According to Rosenthal, one of the main traits of a great casting director is the ability to find “true intimacy” and “a language with the filmmaker” to realize their vision. “My job is to help realize the vision of the film by my palette,” she said. “My canvas is the people, so I want to cast it so that you [the audience] are emotionally engaged and the film works.” ",

        "title": "‘Falcon Lake’ Review: Heartbreak — and Possibly Ghosts — Lurk Under a Melancholy Summer Romance",
        "content": "The eerily contemplative opening frames of “Falcon Lake” depict an idyllic lake on a summer night, a scene so calmly off-putting that you just know something has to be amiss. The shot remains unchanged for so long that when a body finally rises out of the water, it feels more like an inevitable moment of catharsis than a jump scare. That ominous serenity continues throughout “Falcon Lake,” yet the first truly startling moment in Charlotte Le Bon’s directorial debut is the sight of a Nintendo Switch.Thanks to Le Bon’s dreamlike pacing and Kristof Brandl’s grainy cinematography, the film‘s opening scenes of a nuclear family heading out for a lake house vacation come across as a long-buried memory unfolding before our eyes. The establishing shots would seamlessly fit into an ABC-era “Twin Peaks” episode, and the fashion could be ripped straight from a mid-90s Vineyard Vines catalog. The effect is so convincing that a brief mention of a contemporary video game console becomes an almost Brechtian revelation that we’re watching something that takes place in our own world. That brilliant directorial choice sucks us into the same predicament that her characters can’t avoid: We’re always tempted to drift toward nostalgia despite the real-world pain that keeps being shoved in our faces.Falcon Lake is allegedly haunted by a ghost, and undeniably haunted by secret desires. The 13-year-old Bastien (Joseph Engel) is starting to rage with hormones, and his parents are filled with their own desires for extramarital affairs as they head to spend the summer at their friends’ cabin. Bastien’s sights are set on Chloe (Sara Montpetit), the family friends’ plucky 16-year-old daughter who isn’t exactly thrilled to be sharing her digs with two children for the summer. She’s much more interested in enjoying the Falcon Lake social scene, which typically revolves around stealing homemade wine from her dad and drinking with boys around campfires.She’s frequently saddled with babysitting duties — presumably so her parents can fuck Bastien’s parents — but she manages to entertain herself by scaring Bastien and his younger brother with stories about the ghost who lives in the lake. When that gets old, she starts introducing him to booze and drugs. A proximity-based friendship quickly begins to form, if for no other reason than they both need someone to drink with. But it evolves into a more serious mentor-mentee relationship as she teaches him to navigate hangovers, house parties, and — eventually — female anatomy.Like any great age-gap movie, “Falcon Lake” finds drama in the gray areas of the forbidden relationship between the two teenagers. It’s never lost on either Bastien or Chloe that he’s lusting after her and she’s just killing time with him. There are occasional moments when his passion and her boredom align in a way that gives them both what they want, but the gap in enthusiasm is apparent when he watches her pursue boys she’s much more interested in. Even the most salacious moments in the film are infused with a sense of melancholy, as it becomes clear that we’re watching the best moments of a story that’s destined to end badly.Yet we keep watching, due in large part to the deeply human performances from Engel and Montpetit. His understated maturity gives the impression that his soul is much older than 13, which juxtaposes delightfully with his blatant ignorance about adult activities. And she is the perfect embodiment of a teenage girl who has become so bored of her daily routine that she’s willing to dip her toes into forbidden taboos just to blow up the monotony.It’s truly astounding that “Falcon Lake” is the work of a first-time feature director. Le Bon demonstrates a masterful understanding of shot composition and pacing that allows her to craft a haunting vibe without turning it into a gimmick. The promise that “Falcon Lake” is going to turn into a genre film is always lurking around the corner, but we spend most of the time watching a perverse love child of “Licorice Pizza” and “Call Me By Your Name.” Bastien and Chloe demonstrate the kind of “more than a friendship, not quite a romance” connection that will be instantly recognizable to anyone who has partaken in an ephemeral summer fling. Much like the rumored Falcon Lake ghost, it almost doesn’t matter if the romantic connection was ever real — because the emotions it evoked are there to stay.“Falcon Lake” premiered in the Directors’ Fortnight at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival. The film is now playing in select theaters from Yellow Veil Pictures.",

        "title": "The 7 Best New Movies on Netflix in June 2023",
        "content": "If you watched May turn into June and immediately realized that you had nothing to watch, you’re not alone. The spring came with its now-traditional influx of Prestige TV thanks to an Emmy calendar that incentivizes networks to release all their biggest shows at the last possible moment to ensure they stay fresh in the minds of voters. That makes it quite fun when “Succession,” “Barry,” and “Yellowjackets” all start up again at the same time — but rather depressing when they all end at once.If you’re looking for some entertainment to fill your days before July rolls in with “Mission: Impossible 7” and the “Barbie”/”Oppenheimer” double feature, Netflix’s latest slate of additions to its film library has plenty of gems to be found. The new lineup is filled with ’80s classics, from beloved teen comedies like “The Breakfast Club” to over-the-top sci-fi blockbusters such as “Terminator 2: Judgement Day.” Anyone looking to take a trip down memory lane is in luck.There’s plenty of great contemporary fare as well, including the Sarah Snook-led psychological thriller “Run Rabbit Run.” The Australian film was one of the buzziest titles to premiere at the Sundance Film Festival this year, and Snook’s first major post-“Succession” role is bound to be a draw for grieving fans of the HBO series.Whatever your entertainment poison of choice is, you’re bound to be able to find something new you like on Netflix this month. Keep reading for our seven favorite movies debuting on the streaming service in June.Bill Murray gives the best performance of his career in Harold Ramis’ story about a curmudgeonly weatherman who can’t stop reliving the same day. What starts out as a dry comedy about the pointlessness of a holiday revolving around a groundhog seeing its shadow gradually morphs into a timeless story about the secrets to happiness under Ramis’ capable direction. The brilliantly repetitive nature ensures that no matter how many times you’ve seen it, it always gets better on the next viewing.Nobody does sequels better than James Cameron. The king of sci-fi blockbusters somehow found a way to improve on Ridley Scott’s “Alien” and up the VFX ante with his long-delayed “Avatar” sequel, so in hindsight it’s not surprising that he hit his “Terminator” sequel out of the park. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s cold, villainous turn in the original “Terminator” was iconic, but Cameron’s decision to flip the script and turn him into the good guy in “Judgement Day” made him a bona fide movie star. Throw in some of the best live action set pieces of Cameron’s career, and you end up with a near-perfect summer movie. Adam Sandler’s upcoming reunion with Josh and Bennie Safdie has indie film lovers ecstatic to see the comedian’s dramatic renaissance continue. But anyone who has tracked his entire career knows that Sandler was demonstrating dramatic talent long before “Uncut Gems.” One of his better roles of the 2000s was “Funny People,” Judd Apatow’s understated film about a comic who reevaluates his life after learning he has a terminal illness. Many of the signature Apatow tropes are still there, but it’s one of the most sophisticated storytelling efforts that either of the two men has participated in. Nearly 20 years after it first hit theaters, “Mean Girls” is back in the zeitgeist (to the extent that it ever truly left) thanks to Tina Fey’s upcoming film adaptation of the Broadway musical it inspired. While you wait for the new movie to come out, it’s a great time to rewatch the original — which is still one of the most addictively quotable teen movies of all time. Sometimes classics are classics for a reason. John Hughes’ landmark teen comedy about five high schoolers from dramatically different cliques who bond in detention has been copied, parodied, and generally memed to death in the 40 years since it hit theaters. The fact that it’s still endlessly watchable is a testament to his clever script and the stellar ensemble cast headlined by Molly Ringwald and Emilio Estevez.Anyone who prefers Christopher Nolan movies that are grounded in historical accuracy has a big summer ahead of them, with his highly anticipated biopic “Oppenheimer” hitting theaters next month. But why not start the festivities earlier and revisit his first war movie? “Dunkirk” proved that Nolan’s knack for spectacle was just as compelling when he didn’t have a twisty plot to work with, recreating the famous WWII retreat with a stark realism that prompted many to deem it one of the best war movies of the century. There’s no shame in suffering from “Succession” withdrawal, but time (eventually) heals all wounds. It won’t be long before you can see your favorite cast members in bigger film roles, starting with Sarah Snook’s upcoming turn in “Run Rabbit Run.” The Australian thriller, which premiered at Sundance, stars the former Waystar Royco heiress as a fertility doctor who begins to suspect that something sinister is afoot when her young daughter begins vividly describing her memories of past lives.

        "title": "Oscar Season Hits Movie Theaters, from ‘Across the Spider-Verse’ to ‘Past Lives’",
        "content": "With the Cannes Film Festival in the rearview, the summer movie season has begun. Yes, “The Little Mermaid” and “Fast X” are already out, but this week, two more releases add another variable to the theatrical calendar: Oscar potential.With the release of “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” the long-awaited sequel to the animated sensation that became the first (and so far only) superhero movie to win an Oscar has landed. Critical acclaim proves that the lengthy delay wasn’t in vain. As IndieWire’s Kate Erbland writes in her review: “In a genre built on the literally super and special, these films are unafraid to stand out and do something truly different, something that pushes the limits, to show the genuine range available to this subset of stories and feel damn good in the process (and look, dare we say, even better).”The movie is poised to perform well commercially and follow its predecessor into awards season, but moviegoers looking for a quieter option this weekend don’t have to stay home, as A24’s Sundance hit “Past Lives” hits theaters as well. The acclaim debut from playwright Celine Song is an autobiographical riff on her own experiences as a Korean immigrant reconciling with a companion from her past. As IndieWire’s Anne Thompson wrote earlier this week, the great surprise of the movie is that Song proves she’s just as talented at filmmaking as she is with the stage.In this week’s episode of Screen Talk, Thompson and Eric Kohn reunite to discuss these new films and why they inject fresh energy into the release calendar. They also look ahead to the release of Wes Anderson’s “Asteroid City,” and touch on several other highlights from Cannes this month, including Palme d’Or winner “Anatomy of a Fall” and Martin Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon,” both of which have awards prospects of their own.Watch the full episode above or listen to it below.Screen Talk is produced by Azwan Badruzaman and available on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, and Spotify, and hosted by Megaphone.

        "content": "Amanda Seyfried is ready to return to her comedy roots with one caveat: The Writers Guild of America strike must conclude.Seyfried is set to star in ensemble comedy film “My Ex-Friend’s Wedding” alongside Ariana DeBose, Megan Stalter, Liza Koshy, and Chloe Fineman. However, the ongoing WGA strike has pushed back production.“I mean, we’ve got to collectively win these strikes, and then I can tell you something about it,” Seyfried told IndieWire while at “The Crowded Room” premiere. “But I can’t now because it’s way too funny and we’re not shooting it right now.”She added of the film, “Back to my roots, you know? I’m so excited.”“My Ex-Friend’s Wedding” is directed by Kay Cannon (“Blockers”) from a script co-written by Ashley Rodger and “Daisy Jones & the Six” author Taylor Jenkins Reid. The film was picked up by Sony in March 2023 following a bidding war.The comedy follows four childhood best friends who receive a drunken voicemail from their former best friend the night before her wedding, confessing that she thinks she’s making a mistake tying the knot. The pals set off to stop the wedding and reunite with their ex-bestie.Emmy winner Seyfried previously addressed the WGA strike affecting productions in an interview with Variety at the Met Gala.“Everything changed with streaming, and everyone should be compensated for their work,” Seyfried said. “It’s fucking easy.”In addition to “My Ex-Friend’s Wedding,” Seyfried is set to star in a Broadway reimagining of Oscar-winning film “Thelma & Louise” alongside Evan Rachel Wood.Seyfried confirmed in an Instagram video that she is in New York working on “something that is magic and it’s musical.” She continued, “So I’m finally getting to do something that I’ve never really done. That’s all I can really say about it. Hopefully more soon. But it’s a lot of work.”Seyfried previously starred in musical films “Mamma Mia!,” “Mamma Mia 2,” and “Les Misérables.” Seyfried revealed she auditioned for Jon M. Chu’s two-part movie adaptation of musical “Wicked” for the role of Glinda the Good Witch. The part eventually went to Ariana Grande.",

        "title": "Hello, Summer Breakout! ‘Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse’ Exceeds All Expectations in Early Shows",
        "content": "“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” (Sony) amassed $17.35 million in Thursday shows starting at 2 p.m. That’s $150,000 behind what the previews for “Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3” (Disney) did four weeks ago, on its way to a $118.4 weekend.That’s a huge jump from 2018’s “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.” In a much different environment (evening-only shows on a dead mid-December Thursday), it grossed $3.5 million before a surprising $35.4 million initial weekend.These results position the second “Spider-Verse” to see a potentially bigger weekend than “Guardians.” Many schools are now closed for summer vacation, elevating Friday’s potential audience. And though it won’t get as high a percentage of viewers who opt for premium screens, Sony does control many of them.That level of achievement would be a welcome surprise. Before improved tracking last weekend, industry consensus was $60 million-$70 million opening. Even after increased interest was seen, the guess was still under $90 million.Several factors elevate “Spider-Verse”:— The first film was critically acclaimed, won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, and grossed a surprising $194 million in its Christmas 2018 release;— “Spider-Man: No Way Home” remains the biggest domestic hit since 2019, and this is the next film from that Marvel subset;— The new film is receiving rapturous reviews (86 score on Metacritic, rarely seen for a studio release);— It comes after the unexpected massive success for the animated “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” (Universal), now over $560 million domestic (biggest of 2023 so far). “SMB” showed significant adult interest for an animated film, and it’s one with less-obvious appeal than “Spider-Verse.”Add this: Although business was uneven, May’s three top releases (“Guardians,” “Fast X,” and “The Little Mermaid”) all played at levels at or near expectations — nothing groundbreaking, but enough audience interest to give hope for the summer. But with none expected to reach $400 million domestic (an achievement ticked by two May releases last year), a void remains to be filled. “No Way Home,” “Top Gun: Maverick,” “Avatar: The Way of Water,” and “SMB” show when the public is excited, the potential is there.Perhaps “Spider-Verse” is the hero film that theaters seek. It’s a great start (to note: “SMB” with its Wednesday opening skipped previews, so there is no comparison). This is a week later than “Maverick” last year, which rose to $709 million on the back of terrific word of mouth. It created enough theatrical goodwill to boost the entire summer. If “Spider-Verse” can do the same thing, it will be a crucial plus to a summer season that so far is slightly below last year.",

        "title": "Peter Rice Didn’t Land A24 in New Production Deal — A24 Landed Peter Rice",
        "content": "Dethroned Disney executive Peter Rice announced his curve ball of a next move with a carefully orchestrated “exclusive.” He did not join another studio or streamer. He did not raise millions, like his old Fox mentor Peter Chernin, to finance his own projects. Instead, he threw in his lot with rising star A24 to become an “independent producer.”Thing is: Rice is not, and never has been, a producer. He’s been intimately involved with some storied productions, like Baz Luhrmann’s “Moulin Rouge.” He has an extraordinary roster of relationships, talent and otherwise. But above all Rice is an executive — specifically, one of the most experienced, capable, and respected film and TV executives, one who was earmarked as an heir apparent from his earliest days in Hollywood. It makes more sense to view A24 not as a platform for Rice, but Rice as being the platform for A24.When Rice joined the Fox movie studio in marketing back in 1989, uber-boss Rupert Murdoch anointed him as someone to watch. (He was a new graduate from the University of Nottingham.) As a production executive, Rice was proud to back Baz Luhrmann’s “Romeo + Juliet,” starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, and musical “Moulin Rouge,” which saw Murdoch and Nicole Kidman dancing on tables at Cannes.After Rice took over the specialty arm Fox Searchlight in 2000, he led the division to 51 Academy Award nominations, including 10 nominations and eight wins for Danny Boyle’s “Slumdog Millionaire” in 2009. Rice’s many creative relationships include not only Luhrmann and Boyle but Alex Proyas and the Hughes brothers.Of course, Rice is best-known for his stellar TV career, where he spent more than a decade advancing from chairman and CEO of Fox Networks to president of 21st Century Fox. Upon the sale to Disney, he became chairman of Walt Disney Television and thrived as the studio’s most senior television content executive — until his success proved too threatening to chairman Bob Chapek. He showed Rice the door in June 2022, not long before Chapek was ousted in November and replaced by former CEO Bob Iger.Rice socked away a lot of money, especially during the Disney sale. He doesn’t need to worry about that. He has the same luxury as Barry Diller did back in the day, when he left Murdoch and Fox and looked around to realize he would rather build his own company than run someone else’s.Which is why many in Hollywood are looking sideways at the idea that Rice is going the independent producer route. This non-exclusive, open-ended deal provides enough wriggle room to figure out what his next move really is — or, to help A24 become a bigger studio.A24 has massive ambitions of its own. A year ago, after speculation swirled that it was for sale, the company raised $225 million. Growth equity company Stripes, which invests in brands like GoFundMe and Erehwon, now owns 10 percent of A24 at a valuation of $2.5 billion.For now, A24 is ready to spend more to gain access to Rice’s sizable brain. He knows how multimedia companies work. “A24 is a business whose aspirations are unlimited,” said one high-level Hollywood executive. “They’re not trying to become Focus. They want to become a big media company.” Hiring Rice is a way for A24 — which just paid $10 million for Manhattan’s Cherry Lane Theatre, invested in music startup Gamma, and launched makeup line Half Magic, which capitalized on the trendsetting looks in the A24 production “Euphoria” — to smartly grow its business.A24 still makes movies for theatrical release, like last year’s Oscar-winner “Everything Everywhere All At Once” ($111 million worldwide); this year’s Sundance and Berlin hit “Past Lives,” which opens today, may follow suit. But the modest indie drama faces a challenging period for specialty films that not even the trendy A24 brand can counter. Ari Aster’s “Beau is Afraid” topped out at $9.6 million worldwide, a disappointing return for a $35-million budget. And Nicole Holofcener’s “You Hurt My Feelings” is struggling in theaters, even with strong reviews.Coming this fall is director Jonathan Glazer’s return to filmmaking after a 10-year absence, Cannes prize-winner “Zone of Interest.” The German-language holocaust drama starring Sandra Huller could be a UK international Oscar submission, but may not drive box office. Others in the movie pipeline include “Problemista,” “Talk to Me,” and “The Iron Claw.”It’s more likely that where A24 and Rice will make noise is television, where the studio already has “Euphoria” and Sam Levinson’s Cannes debut “The Idol,” as well as Netflix’s “Beef.” The company has few partners; A24’s exclusive digital deal with Showtime expires in November and it has not replaced its streaming deal with Apple. However, expect Rice’s A24 shingle to prove magnetic. The only question is how much the cash-frugal A24 makes available for development. Whatever material they don’t finance, he can set up elsewhere.Rice can generate more content volume and guide A24 toward world domination, should it so desire. If that does happen, Rice would make an excellent leader. For now, it’s a win-win for both companies, however long the romance lasts.",

Now, Page is reveling in being a trans man.“It definitely feels a way that I never thought I would get to feel, and that mostly manifests in how present I feel, the ease I feel and the ability to exist. There’s been periods in my life where I really felt like I didn’t,” Page said. “So often it’s a lot more in the quiet moments. I think we talk about ‘trans joy’ and euphoria. So much of it is in the stillness. To have my shoulders back. I just was always kind of shut off, anxious. I used to never feel like my skin was my own.”He added, “I realize I look different to people now who’ve known me from before, but I’m thinking, ‘Oh my gosh, there’s that person I’ve seen but never thought I’d actually get to see.’ It catches me by surprise sometimes. A friend will simply take a photo and then I get a glimpse, and it just sends this electric thrill through my body, this sort of spark. Because it’s funny — it’s seeing something new, but also not.”Page credited Catherine Keener, Alia Shawkat, and Kristen Wiig for encouraging him to “go against the forces that were telling me to not be true.”The “Juno” Oscar nominee addressed his own privilege as a trans actor compared to other trans people across the world.“I do feel like I barely made it in many ways,” Page said, adding, “The privilege I have does not represent the reality of most trans lives. The reality is trans people disproportionately are unemployed, disproportionately experience homelessness. Trans women of color are being murdered. People are losing their healthcare.”Page summed up, “When I’m walking down the street, and young people come up to me, it means the world to me. Them being themselves, having the courage to say, ‘This is who I am, and I’m going to live authentically.'”",

        "content": "Matthew Broderick is reflecting on having more than a few off days on the set of “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.”Broderick detailed working with director John Hughes on the 1986 teen comedy, which also starred Alan Ruck, Jennifer Grey, Mia Sara, and Charlie Sheen.“He was not easygoing in some ways,” Broderick said of Hughes during The Hollywood Reporter’s “It Happened in Hollywood” podcast. “He was nervous it wouldn’t come out right.”Broderick continued, “I remember we did a costume test early on. We walked around the streets of Chicago in our costumes and they filmed us — me, Alan, Jennifer Grey and Mia. That was a big drama. When the footage came back, he said none of us were ‘fun to watch.’ We were ‘boring’ in our tests. Actually, some of us he did like, but some he did not, and I was one he did not.”Broderick noted that he was a “not a total newcomer” prior to his breakout “Ferris Bueller” role, citing his part in “War Games.” However, Broderick had not experienced butting heads with a director like Hughes at the time.“To have him say, ‘I’m not used to having somebody be so dead,’ or whatever he said to me. I wasn’t really ‘in it’ or something,” Broderick recalled. “That happened and I said, ‘So get somebody you like.'”Broderick shared another memory of working with Hughes on set, saying, “He said, ‘I like when your eyes go wide, and then smaller, and then go wide again.’ I said, ‘If you tell me exactly what my face is doing, I get kind of self-conscious. Now I’m thinking of my face.’ And he was like, ‘Well, then, I won’t direct you at all.’ And for a few days he didn’t give me anything. Until I finally had to say, ‘John, you have to direct me, come on.’ That was our worst one.”The “No Hard Feelings” actor added, “He was somebody who could get angry at you, not outwardly angry, but you could tell. He would turn dead. Dead-faced, I would say, ‘What did you think of that?’ And he’d say, ‘I don’t know.’ Just nothing. ‘OK. John doesn’t like that.'”Broderick summed up, “He took the work very seriously is what I mean. [John] wasn’t a loosey-goosey person. But he also didn’t hold a grudge and knew how to get himself out of it.”",

Director Nick Cassavetes told Gosling that playing Noah, opposite Rachel McAdams’ Ali, in the decades-spanning epic would make for an unexpected choice.“[Nick] straight up told me: ‘The fact that you have no natural leading man qualities is why I want you to be my leading man,'” Gosling said.He went on to compare his early career to a therapy of sorts, saying, “I was trying to find a place to put all these things that were happening to me. And these films became ways to do that, like time capsules. So you kinda make the movie for yourselves. Doesn’t matter if anyone else does, you know? But I think, having done a lot of that, I realize that I kind of feel like my job is for other people to feel it. And it’s cool if I do, but that’s really not the point. The point is that other people do.”Gosling added of his current career outlook, “I treat it more like work now, and not like it’s, you know, therapy. It’s a job, and I think in a way that allows me to be better at it because there’s less interference.”The “Fall Guy” star noted that he “had to kind of take the back entrance” to bigger budget films coming from the indie space. “I’ve always wanted to do it,” the “Blue Valentine” actor said. “I just never really had the opportunity like this, or it never kind of worked itself out this way. It took me a long time to get into sort of bigger, more commercial films. I had to kind of take the back entrance.”Gosling previously reflected on his “Notebook” casting to Company (via The Huffington Post) in 2011.“Nick Cassavetes called me to meet home at his house. When I got there, he was standing in his backyard, and he looked at me and said, ‘I want you to play this role because you’re not like the other young actors out there in Hollywood.

        "content": "Harrison Ford was determined to show Indiana Jones’ age onscreen.Despite being CGI-ed for a flashback sequence in Ford’s farewell to the adventurer in “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” the actor told Esquire that it was essential to the franchise to show the character as an “old man.”Ford detailed one scene in which Indiana Jones rides a horse through New York City during the moon landing celebration. While filming, three stunt workers were spotting him.“I thought, ‘What the fuck?’ Like I was being attacked by gropers,” Ford said. “I look down and there’s three stunt guys there making sure I didn’t fall off the stirrup. They said, ‘Oh, we were just afraid because we thought, you know, and bah bah bah bah.’ And I said, ‘Leave me the fuck alone…Leave me alone, I’m an old man getting off a horse and I want it to look like that!'”Ford, who also rides horses onscreen in “Yellowstone” prequel show “1923,” did become injured on the set of “Dial of Destiny” after filming a fight sequence with co-star Mads Mikkelsen. Ford tore the muscle off his right shoulder and stepped away from production for eight weeks to recover.“I’m also known for shutting movies down because I get hurt, which is not something you want to be known for,” Ford admitted. “But hey, shit happens.”The “Shrinking” actor addressed his desire for “Dial of Destiny” to be the most “ambitious” character study of Indiana Jones in the franchise. “Dial of Destiny” is the first film not directed by Steven Spielberg, instead with James Mangold helming the feature. Spielberg serves as an executive producer.“I wanted an ambitious movie to be the last one,” Ford said, “And I don’t mean that we didn’t make ambitious movies before — they were ambitious in many different ways. But not necessarily as ambitious with the character as I wanted the last one to be.”Spielberg applauded Mangold’s vision for the final “Indiana Jones” film starring Ford.“It’s really, really a good ‘Indiana Jones’ film. I’m really proud of what Jim has done with it,” Spielberg said. “When the lights came up I just turned to the group and said, ‘Damn! I thought I was the only one who knew how to make one of these.'”",

        "content": "“Oppenheimer” has dropped a major bomb: The Christopher Nolan historical epic is rated R.Variety reported that Nolan’s first film with Universal since parting ways with longtime distributor Warner Bros. has received an R-rating and clocks in at just under three hours. That’s Nolan’s first R rating since his 2002 thriller “Insomnia” and 2000’s “Memento” before it. “Oppenheimer” follows the emotional implosion behind the father of the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), as he creates the ultimate weapon amid World War II.The ensemble film also stars Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt, Kenneth Branagh, Rami Malek, Casey Affleck, Gary Oldman, James Remar, Josh Hartnett, and Alden Ehrenreich.Shot in IMAX and film, “Oppenheimer” uses “11 miles of film stock” that weighs close to 600 pounds, as Nolan told the Associated Press.“The sharpness and the clarity and the depth of the image is unparalleled,” the director said. “The headline, for me, is by shooting on IMAX 70mm film, you’re really letting the screen disappear. You’re getting a feeling of 3D without the glasses. You’ve got a huge screen and you’re filling the peripheral vision of the audience. You’re immersing them in the world of the film.”Nolan added of the recreation of the atomic bomb without CGI, “We knew that this had to be the showstopper. We’re able to do things with picture now that before we were really only able to do with sound in terms of an oversize impact for the audience — an almost physical sense of response to the film.”Nolan previously said that “Oppenheimer” is “one of the most challenging projects I’ve ever taken on in terms of the scale of it, and in terms of encountering the breadth of Oppenheimer’s story.”The “Tenet” director shared, “There were big, logistical challenges, big practical challenges. But I had an extraordinary crew, and they really stepped up. It will be a while before we’re finished. But certainly as I watch the results come in, and as I’m putting the film together, I’m thrilled with what my team has been able to achieve.”“Oppenheimer” premieres in theaters July 21, sharing the same release date as “Barbie.” For all the details on “Oppenheimer,” click here.",

Known as everything from a charismatic NBA legend and “Trainwreck” scene-stealer, to “Space Jam: A New Legacy” cringe-inducing lead and YA author, the multi-hyphenate mogul’s own entertainment empire is now behind Peacock Original film “Shooting Stars,” which aims to capture his own high school years.Based on the book of the same name that James penned with “Friday Night Lives” author Buzz Bissinger, “Shooting Stars” centers on James’ own teen experience with his “Fab Four” friend group in Ohio. Billed as the “original story of the basketball superhero,” the ode to James is laid on thick thanks to a cliched script by Frank E. Flowers, Tony Rettenmaier, and Juel Taylor. But if you’re a die-hard James fan, and have a high tolerance for self-congratulatory films, “Shooting Stars” might be worth the almost two hours of your time.Real-life Oregon Ducks college player Marquis “Mookie” Cook deftly makes his screen debut playing a teenaged James in the film, who switches high schools after one of his best friends, Lil Dru (Caleb McLaughlin of “Stranger Things” fame), doesn’t make the varsity basketball team. Along with the rest of their foursome, rounded out by Willie McGee (Avery S. Wills) and Sian Cotton (Khalil Everage), the pals transfer to a predominantly white Catholic high school to play together on the same team again.Meanwhile, their new coach (Dermot Mulroney) is looking for career redemption after being demoted from a college gig and the Fab Four must also pivot to being teammates with former rival Romeo Travis (Sterling “Scoot” Henderson) while their local community deems them “sellouts” for leaving their school behind. “The Wire” alum Wood Harris plays assistant Coach Dru, who is also the dad of Lil Dru.The expected highlight of a film about basketball, specifically one of the greatest basketball players of all-time, and starring actual basketball players, would likely be amazing basketball sequences. Nope. Instead, the film is shot similarly to the disorienting (and laughable) action scenes in “Space Jam: A New Legacy,” thanks to director Chris Robinson’s approach. Add in Mulroney telling his team to “Go home and eat your Wheaties” and the film misses the mark on camp and teeters on terrible.Mulroney is in his own miscast world, complete with a curly wig he must have borrowed from Ben Affleck after “Air” wrapped production. His performance would be entertaining in a film that wasn’t trying to be so serious; but then again, “Shooting Stars” has poorly paced slo-mo and an Ice Cube “It Was a Good Day” needle drop that is so out of place it borders on a fever dream.This isn’t entirely a narrative work, either. Rather, we’re watching a commercial to buy into James’ lore. When his high school girlfriend (and future wife) asks James, “Are you going to be famous now?” after the team wins the 2001 Ohio state championship, it’s a clunky nod to what we all know is to come. James won’t just become famous, he’ll became an international superstar. And the real-life James won’t let us forget that either.“He made it to the NBA…where word is he did OK,” the final caption reads once the credits roll, giving us updates on all of the real-life counterparts of the film. With James’ Springhill Company behind the movie, we only see the sweet friendships, the glory of victory, and of course, James’ iconic celebrity. Too bad a lay-up of a biography isn’t interesting at all.“Shooting Stars” starts streaming on Friday, June 2 on Peacock.",

        "title": "Dwayne Johnson to Lead New ‘Fast & Furious’ Movie Despite Publicly Swearing Off the Franchise",
        "content": "Just when Dwayne Johnson thought he was out of the family, they pulled him back in.The action superstar has closed a deal to return to the “Fast & Furious” franchise in a new film from screenwriter Chris Morgan, IndieWire has confirmed. Unlike Johnson’s 2019 spinoff “Hobbs and Shaw,” the untitled film will take place within the main storyline of the franchise. However, it will not be an official numbered “Fast & Furious” film. The project has been described as a story that bridges the events of “Fast X” and the upcoming “Fast X: Part II,” which is expected to be the final film in the series.The news marks a major reversal for Johnson, who had publicly dismissed the idea of returning to the franchise. After playing Luke Hobbs in five “Fast & Furious” movies beginning with 2011’s “Fast Five” and ending with “Hobbs & Shaw,” Johnson famously departed the franchise on bad terms with Diesel.The two actors clashed while working together on previous “Fast & Furious” movies, with Johnson taking issue with Diesel’s work ethic. The feud between the two stars escalated in 2021 when Diesel used his personal social media channels to publicly ask Johnson to reconsider his decision to leave.“My little brother Dwayne… the time has come,” Diesel posted on Instagram. “The world awaits the finale of Fast 10. As you know, my children refer to you as Uncle Dwayne in my house. There is not a holiday that goes by that they and you don’t send well wishes… but the time has come. Legacy awaits.”Johnson made it clear that he did not appreciate Diesel’s tactics and once again closed the door on a reunion in a subsequent interview.“I told [Diesel] directly that I would not be returning to the franchise. I was firm yet cordial with my words and said that I would always be supportive of the cast and always root for the franchise to be successful, but that there was no chance I would return,” Johnson said. “Vin’s recent public post was an example of his manipulation. I didn’t like that he brought up his children in the post, as well as Paul Walker’s death. Leave them out of it. We had spoken months ago about this and came to a clear understanding.”But Johnson’s relationship with the franchise appeared to be improving when he made an uncredited appearance as Hobbs in “Fast X,” leading many to speculate that a larger return could be imminent.",

        "title": "‘Across the Spider-Verse’ Added 3 New Directors to Continue the Epic Coming-of-Age Story",
        "content": "The complexity of “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” became evident even prior to the completion of its ground-breaking, Oscar-winning predecessor, “Into the Spider-Verse,” so producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller recruited three new directors, who eagerly asked to join the franchise: Joaquim Dos Santos (“The Legend of Korra”), Kemp Powers (“Soul” co-director and “One Night in Miami” Oscar-nominated screenwriter), and Justin K. Thompson (“Into the Spider-Verse” production designer). The producers called them their “band of musicians,” with each contributing his own creative specialty in helping Miles Morales forge his own Spidey path in this epic sequel (which concludes with “Beyond the Spider-Verse,” opening March 29, 2024).Dos Santos choreographed the thrilling action sequences as Miles (Shameik Moore) travels through several multiverses with potential love interest Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) and the Spider-Society team led by Oscar Isaac’s Miguel O’Hara. Their worlds are threatened by Spot/Dr. Jonathan Ohnn (Jason Schwartzman), who harnesses the power of a super Collider and traverses time and space through inter-dimensional portals on his body.Powers provided emotional gravitas by sharpening the cultural authenticity of Miles as a superhero of color and the universality of his coming-of-age story. He particularly honed in on the importance of family, individual expression, and collaborative teamwork.Thompson brought a keen understanding of world-building and contributed to every faced of the production with the introduction of five new Spidey dimensions: the watercolor-inspired Earth-65, from which Gwen’s Spider-Woman hails; Mumbattan, a mashup of Mumbai and Manhattan, home to Pavitr Prabhakar (Karan Soni); the futuristic brutalism of Nueva York, where Miguel runs Spider-Society HQ; the punk poster collage look of New London, inhabited by Daniel Kaluuya’s Hobie; and a dark and gritty place that will remain spoiler free.But while the 1,000-member crew at Sony Pictures Imageworks continued to set new industry standards in 2D stylization for CG, the directors focused on Miles’ emotional arc. “I think, for us, the throughline was: Can we track Miles’ journey through this?” Dos Santos told IndieWire. “The answer was yes, we hope that sticks. And if the repeat viewing means, ‘Hey, I gotta go see what that little editorial blurb in the corner was that flashed on here for a second, or the millions of characters,’ then bring it on.”Powers was eager to see where they could take Miles after a growth spurt at 15. “One of the things that really excited me about it was the time jump, the fact that we go a year and a half into the future,” he told IndieWire. “On a personal note, at the time we started on this film, my son was the same age as Miles. So I witnessed the growth spurt and how it’s weird to have your kid grow like seven inches in one year and go from an adolescent to a dude with a beard in your house.”Powers was also intrigued about the Spider-Man credo of loneliness and sacrifice and how Miles transcends it. “As you saw in the first film, he’s got both parents, and he’s close to his family,” he continued. “He became Spider-Man as part of a team with other people who mentor him, and they’re all gone. There was a lot of wonderful, rich stuff dramatically we knew we wanted to mine in this story.”Making the film became personal for Dos Santos, too, because, for the first time, his son pulled his hand away from him while with a friend. “My heart was crushed,” he said. “And something that small, carrying that emotion through the big stuff, is how you make that big stuff matter.” During test screenings, he even noticed how engaged parents were in the film because of the authenticity of their perspective.“These are famous, important characters,” added Powers. “But the reality is, as filmmakers, we start from a place of ourselves and putting our own experiences into it. That’s what makes it authentic, because I come from a place where I believe these are universal, human things that everyone in the world, not just Americans, is going to be dealing with. So, as specific as the characters are, as unique as the characters are, everyone wants the same things for themselves and their families and their kids. It makes you empathetic and it makes you connect with those characters.”This authenticity no doubt accounts for the emotional depth in the scenes between Miles and his dad (Brian Tyree Henry) and Gwen and hers (Shea Whigham), cops torn between professional and personal duty. But what makes these domestic conflicts work so well in animation is the visual contrast between the close-knit, gentrified Brooklyn for Miles and the impressionistic, closed-off mood rings surrounding loner Gwen.There’s also Miles’ struggle with Miguel, who believes in the importance of sticking to canon: If someone is destined to die, you don’t intervene because it will disrupt the Spider-Verse. Whereas Miles believes there is no such thing as canon and you should save everyone.“It was important to us emotionally that we understand why [Miguel] makes the choices he’s making,” Thompson told IndieWire. “And I think that’s the great thing about making a ‘Spider-Verse’ film. No matter how big the spectacle gets, no matter how complex the visuals get, no matter how cool the action gets, there’s always emotion driving every choice we’re making.”It was even more important to flesh out the motivations of Spot, who starts out as a joke to Miles because of his ineptness but eventually becomes a serious threat. He’s the perfect example of form as function and required his own toolset: As his design evolves from a rough sketch with blue construction lines to a fully formed character, he gains control of his inky black portals to unleash the power he possesses.“Walking into the room, you saw a sketch on the thing, and then it started moving, and you didn’t realize that in order to recognize human movement that we relate to, all you need is half a squiggle,” Dos Santos said. “And as we started doing these experiments, I think the most exciting thing for us was that we were given so much permission to support Miles’ journey. We transferred that permission onto the crew. And once they started seeing our reactions to these little experiments, they started doing some more on their own.”Among the most fun was the Mumbattan sequence, which began with researching the Spider-Man India comics and translating that into a unique action-packed, 2D-looking tapestry. They were densely illustrated on special paper, inked very quickly where colors went outside the lines, and then offset printed for a bizarre effect. It took new tools for simulation, linework, and non-photorealistic compositing to pull it off.“And there were all these people on our crew,” Thompson said, “these Indian animators, and visual development artists, and character designers and painters, who came and told us this is what we grew up with. And this is like the comics.”“Some of my favorite things are very subtle, like when the Alchemax building breaks away,” Powers added. “The first time I saw that fully lit, I loved how illustrative that line work was. That we figured out and got in there at the last minute, and during an action sequence you’re gonna have a lot of that.”Fortunately, the producers and directors realized early on that there was too much story to pack into one film, so they split it into two parts and formed a trilogy. But the element they worked on the most was how to tell a complete story with a proper arc for the middle section in the tradition of “The Empire Strikes Back.”“What questions are we gonna leave unanswered?” Dos Santos said. “In my personal experience, whenever there’s a trilogy, I tend to love the middle movies because you can be a little bit darker and you can push things a lot more narratively.”",

        "content": "Steven Yeun is saying nope to any beef with Marvel.The “Nope” actor, who is set to collaborate with “Beef” director Jake Schreier on MCU installment “Thunderbolts,” weighed in on the expectations of leading a superhero film in a roundtable interview with The Hollywood Reporter.“Yeah, Jake Schreier, who did episodes of ‘Beef,’ got the gig to direct [‘Thunderbolts’] and then he saw me for this role and I read the role and I was like, ‘This is actually a really interesting role, I’d be down to explore this,'” Yeun said of his casting. “I think it’s less about now checking things off a bucket list and more looking at an experience.”The “Walking Dead” alum continued, “Sometimes I’ll have conversations with friends who are like, ‘Do you know what you’re doing?’ And I’m like, ‘Yeah, we’re making a movie.’ And they’re like, ‘Do you know what you’re doing?’ I try not to take that in because I think that’s the trap. The trap is to look at that thing in the context of how society might view that thing. In the immediate, I’m just making a movie. Putting it out is a whole other thing that I’m going to have to prepare for afterwards.”While Yeun’s role is under wraps, he told Empire, “The intentions of the particular character that they wanted me to play were very clear, and that’s what drew me to the film.”“Thunderbolts” co-stars Florence Pugh, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, David Harbour, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell, and Hannah John-Kamen and follows the respective MCU anti-heroes. The film was slated for a July 2024 release; however, production has been paused due to the ongoing WGA strike.Actress Pugh recently addressed the pushback she received from joining the MCU after appearing in 2021’s “Black Widow.”“So many people in the indie film world were really pissed off at me. They were like, ‘Great, now she’s gone forever,'” the Oscar nominee said. “And I’m like, no, I’m working as hard as I used to work. I’ve always done back-to-back movies. It’s just people are watching them now. You just have to be a bit more organized with your schedule.”",

        "content": "With Cannes done and dusted and the heavy-hitting autumn quartet of Venice, Telluride, TIFF, and NYFF still a few months off, what’s a film festival fan to do during the dog days of summer? With New York City’s own Tribeca Festival now firmly ensconced in the summer months after moving off its traditional spring dates in 2021, movie lovers both in the city and beyond can enjoy the annual event’s prodigious programming, thanks to a combination of in-person and virtual programming.The 2023 edition will kick off June 7 with the North American premiere of “Kiss the Future,” a documentary following the story of a community of underground musicians and creatives throughout the nearly four-year-long siege of Sarajevo, as well as the 1997 U2 concert celebrating the liberation of the Bosnian capital.A special 30th-anniversary screening of “A Bronx Tale” will close the fest on June 17. After the movie, the film’s director and star and Tribeca co-founder Robert De Niro, producer Jane Rosenthal, and writer and co-star Chazz Palminteri will participate in a live conversation with David Remnick, the editor-in-chief of The New Yorker.In between, Tribeca will host 109 feature films from 127 filmmakers across 36 countries, with 93 world premieres, one international premiere, eight North American premieres, one U.S. premiere, and six New York premieres. So, with such a deep program, what should audiences be seeking out? We’ve got a few ideas, including 16 feature films and one very starry short.This year’s festival run June 7 — 18, and you can check out all of our coverage of it right here, with much more to come.Erin Strecker, Eric Kohn, Anne Thompson, Ryan Lattanzio, and Jude Dry also contributed to this article.German auteur Christian Petzold continues his post-Nina Hoss era with his latest film “Afire,” which world-premiered in Berlin. It’s also the second entry in his “elemental trilogy,” which launched in 2020 with “Undine.” That film incorporated fantasy and folklore to tell a melancholy love story set against the backdrop of water as a connective tissue for romantic connection and separation, winning Paula Beer (Petzold’s closest collaborator since “Transit”) the Silver Bear for Best Actress.While “Afire,” in which Beer returns, is set along the Baltic Sea, this one has more to do with the flames of passion erupting and fizzling between four people trapped in a holiday home that is also surrounded by forest fires. The film also stars Thomas Schubert, Langston Uibel, Enno Trebs, and Matthias Brandt. —RL “Lyle” director Stewart Thorndike didn’t set out to make a queer feminist riff on “The Shining,” but the Overlook Hotel is naturally in her filmmaking DNA. Set at an abandoned hotel in upstate New York, “Bad Things” follows a group of friends over a snowy weekend as they attempt to resist the energy of the hotel’s past inhabitants.The ensemble film stars Gayle Rankin in a powerhouse performance as the film’s own Jack Torrance, here dubbed Ruthie Nod. A livewire actor with a unique sensibility, fans of “Her Smell” will appreciate watching Rankin let out her own inner tempestuous rockstar. As she attempts to outrun some chilling childhood memories, she must contend with jealous lovers and a host of mommy issues. Thorndike’s use of the roving camera as a hovering observer adds a veneer of eeriness to the mounting tension, and her commitment to telling traditionally masculine narratives with women and non-binary folks definitely has teeth. —JDNarcissa Wright amassed a huge online following for live-streaming her speed runs of various video games and breaking many records in the process. In the midst of aiming to beat the world record for a speed run of “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” (no easy task, as anyone who has played this massive open world game will tell you), she also came out as trans.Director Jane M. Wagner’s “Break the Game” tracks that journey with a fascinating blend of the player’s own live streams and a behind-the-scenes look at the personal struggles she faces while navigating a climate not always hospitable to people at a sensitive moments in their lives. As gaming becomes a more and more prominent aspect of modern-day youth culture, documentaries like “Break the Game” offer the human side of an ever-growing ecosystem too often reduced to pixels and memes. Needless to say, Twitch stream are more than frivolous obsessions to the people who follow them, and this documentary is poised to add a critical perspective to that conversation. —EKDespite his prodigious output as an essayist and cultural critic, author Chuck Klosterman’s work has never been the kind to inspire obvious cinematic adaptations (though, personally, the idea of someone attempting to translate Klosterman’s specific brand of winking nostalgia to a doc series does sound somewhat appealing). And yet! Klosterman has, over the years, tried his hand at actual fiction, and thus, it’s high time for a movie version.Klosterman’s first novel, “Downtown Owl,” is also first out of the movie gate, with long-time personal and professional partners Lily Rabe and Hamish Linklater serving as co-directors (Linklater wrote the script, Rabe stars in the film) attempting to turn the three-hander into a comedic look at small-town life for their directorial debut. The film also stars Jack Dylan Grazer, Vanessa Hudgens, Ed Harris, Henry Golding, and Finn Wittrock, who will all play various denizens of tiny, fictional Owl, North Dakota as it braces for an unexpected (and potentially life-changing) blizzard. —KEOscar nominee Michael Shannon was a little confused when he was asked to star in the DC entry “The Flash,” as he thought his character, General Zod, had already died in “Man of Steel.” Fittingly, his directorial debut, “Eric LaRue,” premieres the same week at Tribeca that “The Flash” begins its four-quadrant takeover of global multiplexes.Less fittingly but also no less timely, Shannon’s film seemingly has echoes of another movie led by “The Flash” star Ezra Miller, “We Need to Talk About Kevin.” That’s because “Eric LaRue,” adapted by writer Brett Neveu from his own play, centers on the aftermath of a high school shooting as the killer’s mother, Janice (Judy Greer), prepares not only to visit her son in prison but also to face the tribunal of bereaved local parents affected by the murders. Alexander Skarsgård co-stars as Janice husband, who’s found refuge in a local church, with Tracy Letts and Alison Pill co-starring in a portrait as much about religious fanaticism as it is about atonement and whether or not it’s possible. —RL First-time female director Chelsea Peretti makes her debut with, yes, “First Time Female Director,” which touts the festival’s most tongue-in-cheek title and one we’re expecting that the very funny Peretti will deliver on. The multi-hyphenate does it all on this one: she’s star, writer, director (duh), and producer.The comedy follow Peretti as a rising theater director who is suddenly thrust into the limelight when her local Glendale theater’s main director (a dude) is tossed out (for “inappropriate behavior”). Turns out, being in charge isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, but we bet Peretti and her team had a hell of a time making this one. The star-studded cast also includes Megan Mullally, Blake Anderson, Megan Stalter, and Kate Berlant, plus the film’s official Tribeca synopsis hints at a raft of cameos that will delight comedy fans (and which will not be spoiled here). —KEExecutive produced by Chloé Zhao and helmed by the Oscar winner’s filmmaking mentee Hannah Peterson, “The Graduates” is — terrifyingly, tellingly — the second film about a high school shooting and its aftermath to land on this list. Set a year after the terrible event, Peterson’s film follows high school senior Genevieve (Mina Sundwall) as she wrestles with her past pain and attempts to look forward to what’s coming next.Co-starring many of our favorites, including Maria Dizzia and John Cho, Peterson’s feature debut is being heralded as the arrival of a fresh, deep-feeling new voice in cinema. Get on board now. —KEIn her feature debut, documentarian Maria Fredriksson follows two devout Norwegian sisters, Kari and May, who respond quickly to a divine sign to buy an apartment in Sweden. But the woman selling the apartment looks just like their older sister Astrid — who committed suicide thirty years ago. The sisters bring in Fredriksson to investigate this mystery, and the director uncovers the bizarre secrets of their family history. —ATNon-fiction veteran Sam Pollard (“MLK/FBI”) unearthed rare archival footage to track the tumultuous journey of Negro League baseball through the first half of the twentieth century. The archives include never-before-seen interviews with legends like Satchel Paige, whose early career paved the way for Jackie Robinson, Willie Mays, and Hank Aaron, who started out in the Negro Leagues. The story includes the entrepreneurs who fed competitive rivalries over the decades, such as owners Cumberland Posey, Gus Greenlee, and Effa Manley, the  only woman to belong in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. —ATMonica Sorelle’s first feature follows a family of Haitian immigrants in Miami who grapple with intergenerational challenges from several directions: a father who works hard to survive in an increasingly gentrified community, and a grown son who rejects his family’s traditionalist ways even as he mines them for a standup comedy routine his relatives know nothing about.Sorelle (who worked in the casting department on “Moonlight”) has been invested in supporting stories of the Caribbean diaspora as part of the collective Third Horizon, and further contributes to that effort with this immersive look at modern Haitian life from the inside out. Her filmmaking stands a good chance of being one of the finer discoveries out of this year’s festival. —EKDan Rather was a media icon decades ago, thanks to his immediate reporting on the JFK assassination and his coverage from the frontlines of the Vietnam War. Yet recent times have elevated Rather’s brand to a whole new level, as the 92-year-old has migrated into the social media age with his trenchant for truth-telling intact.While the anchor was pushed off the air over a scandal related to his reporting on George W. Bush in 2004, the last two decades of his career have found him untethered from the traditional restrictions of mainstream media, and a welcome voice of reason in chaotic times. Directed by veteran producer Frank Marshall (“Indiana Jones,” “Gremlins,” “Back to the Future,” etc.), “Rather” promises a long-overdue tribute to the reporter’s legacy, as well as his resilience. —EK Bay Area filmmaker H.P. Mendoza has been one of the more endearing voices of low-budget American filmmaking ever since his 2006 “Colma: The Musical” became a cult hit. “The Secret Art of Human Flight” finds him heading in another playful direction with Grant Rosenmeyer playing a grief-stricken man attempting to learn how to fly from an eccentric guru (“Sound of Metal” Oscar nominee Paul Raci). Mendoza’s best work blends quirkiness and unexpected twists with an undercurrent of melancholy, and this one seems likely to keep that welcome tradition alive. —EKAlden Ehrenreich wrested himself from the possible soul-consuming abyss of a certain sci-fi tentpole with a return to where he got his start: thoughtful independent character studies. His performance in Sundance’s Netflix pick-up “Fair Game” re-heralded a serious actor, and now his directorial debut, the short film “Shadow Brother Sunday,” hopes to announce a serious filmmaker, too.Ehrenreich stars in the short film — and in suave-less, full lumberjack beard mode — as a spun-out musician who returns home on the day of his younger brother’s (“Love, Simon” breakout Nick Robinson) movie premiere to steal his computer and sell it to the paparazzi. Lisa Edelstein and Jacob Wysocki also star. —RL One of four Netflix documentaries to debut at Tribeca, Henry Roosevelt’s film tracks nine-year-old Maya Kowalski who, after being admitted to the ER at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in 2016, is studied for a rare illness and suddenly winds up in state custody. The story is told by the parents, Jack and Beata Kowalski, who doctors wrongfully accused of child abuse. —ATOne of the most daring performance artists working today, Taylor Mac is a monumental musical force with the research chops to back it up. A non-binary cabaret artist revered by the downtown punks and queers. Mac exploded into the mainstream consciousness in 2016 with the monumental 24-hour live show extravaganza, “A 24 Decade History of Popular Music.” Each hour represents a decade in American popular music, stitching a fabulously political history of the country through its songs, both known and revived. Mac worked with longtime costumer Machine Dazzle, who recently showed a solo exhibition at New York’s Museum of Arts and Design, to create the show’s mind-blowing maximalist queer aesthetic.While not everyone has 24 hours to spend at the theater, thankfully this epic masterpiece was filmed and has been cut down to a tight 106-minute documentary, courtesy of acclaimed gay documentary duo Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman. —JDEmbedding with the Taliban as a journalist is a tense and conflicting scenario for anyone, but to do so as a trans man would seem to be openly courting danger. This high-stakes documentary captures the experience of Jordan Bryon, a filmmaker invited by a Taliban commander to film the daily life of his unit after the fall of Kabul for the New York Times.Directed by Bryon with Monica Villamizar, the film follows Byron as he pursues medical transition in Iran, and captures a complicated relationship that develops between Bryon and one of the Taliban fighters. Through a nearly unbelievable confluence of events, the film is sure to offer a wholly unique perspective on both of its seemingly incongruous subject. —JDIf you missed this charmer when it originally premiered on Broadway back in 2016, now’s your chance to catch up with the Tony-nominated musical, based on the beloved movie by Adrienne Shelly. Directed by Brett Sullivan, this is a special taped performance of the theatrical show, starring Sara Bareilles (who also wrote the hella catchy music and lyrics) as Jenna, a down-on-her-luck waitress with an abusive husband who tries to find a more hopeful future when she begins an affair with her doctor.The show originally closed back in 2020, but this taped performance reunites many of the original cast — including Drew Gehling and a scene-stealing Christopher Fitzgerald — for a final hurrah. The songs are memorable, Bareilles is both heartbreaking and delightful, and it’s a special treat to re-discover this gem of a tale brought to new life. Please, producers, make this a trend and find a way to tape more shows a la “Hamilton” so that fans can watch over and over again. —ES",

        "title": "We Should All Believe in Ourselves as Much as Filmmaker Celine Song Believed in Her ‘Past Lives’",
        "content": "Celine Song didn’t have any of the things that usually allow producers to trust a first-time filmmaker. In 2020, the New York Theater Workshop staged her play about the sea women of South Korea, “Endlings,” directed by Sammi Cannold; it received a mixed-to-positive New York Times review. However, there was no short film, no evidence of what Song herself might offer as a director. All she had, Song said, was her “seduction technique” — she believed that her script for “Past Lives” was so good that it would be the build-it-and-they-will-come of screenplays.For so many indie filmmakers, that belief does not end well. In Song’s case, she was right.“It’s the way that I could get collaborators to believe that I can do it,” she said over pre-strike drinks at the Culina Restaurant in Beverly Hills. “If you read the script, and you’re connected to it, then you could talk to me about how I planned on making it. Then, I think, amazing collaborators would be so ready to work with me on it. I don’t have a short to show you. I don’t have other ways, there’s no other proof of concept. It’s more like, ‘I know how to do this.’ Because of the script.”Produced by Killer Films and David Hinojosa’s 2AM, who developed it with distributor A24, “Past Lives” was the hit of Sundance and Berlin 2023 and currently stands as the year’s best-reviewed film (Metascore: 96). A romantic-triangle drama starring “Russian Doll” breakout Greta Lee as Song’s alter ego, the story is inspired by a moment when Song found herself translating between her American husband (played in the film by John Magaro) and her Korean childhood soulmate (Korean star Teo Yoo in the feature). Killer principal Christine Vachon said that it didn’t matter that Song didn’t know film sets; she knew her story.“That’s what you’re looking for,” Vachon said on the phone. “Someone inexperienced who has not been on set before, we can show them how to read a call sheet or what a grip stand is. But if they don’t know the story they want to tell, I don’t know what to do. She really did. Once she understood the physical mechanics of how a movie gets made, she was off to the races.”Song said that the heart of the story stemmed from a powerful memory. “It was me sitting there with my childhood sweetheart and my American husband and translating between the two of them,” Song said. “And first of all, how powerful I felt because I’m in control of time and space or of this amazing meeting of these two people in the universe with no business knowing each other. As we’re sitting there, because we were such a weird trio, I could see that in the bar, people are looking at us trying to figure out who we are to each other.”Song realized, as she told friends the story, that “I should just write it,” she said. “At the time that I was writing it, I didn’t know that anybody was going to make it. And also anybody’s going to let me direct it, too.”The playwright understood the difference between writing for stage and screen. “In theater, the actors are just there to create an entire world with only dialogue,” she said, “only the things that are spoken in the space. And I knew that in film, so many other things are there to be a fundamental part of storytelling. You’ve learned that you can tell the story as simply as the way that a person looks at somebody else.”The story unfolds in three time periods, across two decades and two continents. In South Korea, pre-adolescent Moon Seung-ah and Hae Sung are close friends and academic competitors with romantic feelings — until Moon and her family take off to Toronto, where she changes her name to Nora. In their twenties, Hae Sung and Nora reconnect on the internet. The story is framed by the present 12 years later, when Hae Sung tracks down the married playwright Nora in New York. He needs to close the door that has been left open all these years. And when Nora meets him again, he embodies an alternate reality and a lost part of herself.“We encounter these doors in our lives all the time,” said Song. “But they often go without being noted. Sometimes, these moments are like a portal into a new different reality or universe where you’re with someone else. What made sense to me to articulate in the movie is that feeling of seeing through the door, and then walking away, which is a feeling we all connect to. Just because the door is there, it doesn’t mean that you always walk through it. Sometimes it’s knowing the door is there and then to walk right past it.”When Hae Sung flies 13 hours to see Nora, “he feels that the door is not closed inside of him,” she said. “And it’s not like when he sees through the door, he sees Nora as she has now grown up. He actually sees the door in his heart and he sees a little girl that he loved. So what he wants to do is to close that door by seeing Nora.”Before Lee Isaac Chung’s “Minari” provided precedent, Song wrote the bilingual script using WriterDuet. At the time, Final Draft didn’t support the Korean language. (It does now.)“I wrote it in Korean first if it was in Korean and then I would write English translation underneath for every piece of dialogue,” she said. “It has to be read by the people who are going to make the movie with me because not all of them are going to speak Korean. But also it needed the actors who are going to speak Korean to know exactly what words are going to be used for it because, of course, a language has to be so specific.”A24 gave Song the freedom to cast whoever she wanted, and Song wanted “a soul match from the actor to the character,” she said. “The story of the script has to be connected to what the actor is like. When I would meet an actor, it would be like, ‘is there a part of them that understands this in not just an intellectual way, but in the way they live?’ It’s a chemical thing. They’re a bunch of little marriages where you are going to love them, and accept them for all of their strengths and flaws.”Somehow, Song intuited that she must keep Magaro and Yoo apart until their first on-camera meeting. “We were rolling when that happened,” she said. “So much of the movie is about first hellos. And then the last goodbye. So much of it’s about meeting and leaving each other that it felt important to do some tricks like that, so that the actors can have a little help with this particular extraordinary feeling.”The key crew hire for Song was “Small Axe” cinematographer Shabier Kirchner. “His work was so undeniably amazing,” she said. “You always have to fall a little bit in love with that person who is going to create images with you, and complement you, and do things that I can’t do. He and I are so different. When he is calm, I’m anxious and when I’m calm, he’s anxious, so we can be there for each other in that way. The rhythm was shocking.”When they prepared each scene, “he was always talking about the whole film,” she said. “And we were talking about character, we were talking about story. We weren’t just talking about the technical aspects of it. It was always going to be about, ‘It would be really cool if we did that shot, but does that actually speak to what the scene is?'”Nobody asked Song to change a word of her script, but she learned that real-world forces can push on-set changes. “The rain sequence in the film, for example, used to be very different,” she said. “It was a little more comical and involved 10 locations. But then it became something that really highlights how lonely [Hae Sung] is, by sticking him at the hotel. Or like the scene in Madison Square Park, we thought we were gonna shoot it at MoMA. We ran into what it costs and what it is to try to shoot at MoMA.”Next up: After the opening, we will run Song’s in-depth dissection of the film’s extraordinary one-take final sequence. She’s already written another screenplay, about which she is keeping mum.A24 will release “Past Lives” in theaters on Friday, June 2.",

        "title": "Tom Hanks Admits He’s ‘Been in Some Movies That I Hate’",
        "content": "Tom Hanks may be a beloved screen icon, but that doesn’t mean he’s only in hits.The Oscar winner revealed during a panel discussion at The New Yorker Live with editor-in-chief David Remnick that even he “hates” some of his own films.“OK, let’s admit this: We all have seen movies that we hate. I have been in some movies that I hate,” Hanks said. “You have seen some of my movies and you hate them.”The “Sleepless in Seattle” star explained, “Here are the five points of the Rubicon that are crossed by anybody who makes movies: The first Rubicon you cross is saying yes to the film. Your fate is sealed. You are going to be in that movie. The second Rubicon is when you actually see the movie that you made. It either works and is the movie you wanted to make, or it does not work and it’s not the movie you wanted to make.”He continued, “That has nothing to do with Rubicon No. 3, the critical reaction to it — which is a version of the vox populi. Someone is going to say, ‘I hated it.’ Other people can say, ‘I think it’s brilliant.’ Somewhere in between the two is what the movie actually is. The fourth Rubicon is the commercial performance of the film. Because, if it does not make money, your career will be toast sooner than you want it to be. That’s just the fact. That’s the business. The fifth Rubicon is time.”Hanks reflected on his directorial debut “That Thing You Do!,” which he also wrote and starred in. While the film underperformed at the box office, it later became a cult classic.“Where that movie lands twenty years after the fact. What happens when people look at it, perhaps by accident. And a great example of this is ‘It’s a Wonderful Life,’ which was made [in 1946] and disappeared for the better part of, I’m going to say, twenty years, locked up in a rights issue. It wasn’t even viewed at the time as being a commercial hit. Enough people liked it, so it was nominated for Best Picture,” Hanks said. “For me, it happened on a movie that I wrote and directed called ‘That Thing You Do!’ I loved making that movie. I loved writing it, I loved being with it. I love all the people in it. When it came out, it was completely dismissed by the first wave of vox populi. It didn’t do great business.”The “Asteroid City” actor added, “It hung around for a while, was viewed as being some sort of odd, kinda quasi-ripoff of nine other different movies and a nice little stroll down memory lane. Now the same exact publications that dismissed it in their initial review called it ‘Tom Hanks’s cult classic, “That Thing You Do!”‘ So now it’s a cult classic. What was the difference between those two things? The answer is time.”However, Hanks admitted that there is “no way to tell” if a film is going to be good or not in the production process since filmmaking is “so slow and so specific.”“You have to trust the entire process to collaborators who you hope are working at the absolute top of their game farther down the line,” Hanks summed up. “You can only have faith and hope — and what’s bigger than faith and hope?”",

        "content": "This Barbie is part film programmer.Hari Nef makes history at Mubi with the Hand-Picked by Hari Nef curated series, the first of its kind for the streaming and distribution platform.The “Barbie” and “And Just Like That” actress selected Todd Haynes’ “Safe” and “Velvet Goldmine,” Alex Ross Perry’s “Listen Up Philip,” the fashion documentary “Martin Margiela: In His Own Words,” Jean-Luc Godard’s “La Chinoise,” the coming-of-age day-in-the-life “The African Desperate,” Maurice Pialata’s “Loulou” with Isabelle Huppert, Robert Greene’s “Actress,” Shirley Clarke’s documentary “Portrait of Jason,” and cult classic “Center Stage” from the Mubi vault for the inaugural program.Check out Nef’s full selection, ready to stream, here.“I was thinking about what resonates with me in film, and it starts with ideas of spectacle, performance, and queerness,” Nef said in a press statement. “I love films about performers, and the confrontation that happens between a person, a camera or a stage of some kind. I like to think about what a person has been through, but also consider the historical moment they’re in and how this affects them.”The “Idol” star continued, “Every story that I gravitate to is about people, mostly women, moving from a low to a high place or vice versa. They are motivated to seek out something different than what was prescribed to them in life. The bravery and self-knowledge it takes to do that is already complicated by who you are, where you’re from, and what point in history you’re living in. It’s about being an individual in an environment where that might not necessarily be honored.”Nef previously reflected on her stage and screen career in an interview with The New York Times, admitting that she plays “a lot of bitches.”“I’m no ingénue,” Nef said. “I write, and a lot of the bitches I’ve played are also writers, thinkers. Smart. ‘Bitch’ is often a fill-in for intelligent, for articulate, for opinionated, queer, not conventionally feminine or not conventionally beautiful. I think the ‘Barbie’ stuff happened because I didn’t play bitchy and I didn’t play dumb and I didn’t play plastic in the audition.”Nef will soon be seen in Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie,” opening July 21 from Warner Bros.",

        "title": "It’s June or Bust: This Month Will Determine the Summer Box Office",
        "content": "If Summer 2023 box office has a shot of meeting its optimistic $4 billion projection, the June movie lineup needs to step up. Since May 5, when the season began with Marvel release “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” receipts are down over five percent from last year. To achieve $4 billion, returns now through Labor Day would have to be 26 percent ahead of 2022, when box office totaled just under $3.4 billion.It’s still doable, but the variables are… more variable after May failed to meet its optimistic expectations. “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” didn’t hold as well as hoped, and everything beyond the three top releases proved to be only modest contributors.Despite three lucrative franchises in “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “The Little Mermaid,” and “Fast X,” May will total about $760 million. That’s down from $785 million in 2022, which had only two franchises with “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” and “Top Gun: Maverick.”“Guardians” held well after a below-average start, but it grossed $65 million less than “Guardians 2” last May. “Fast X” and Mermaid” came close to their tempered domestic expectations. More than ever, the business is feast or famine that leaves theaters with little margin for error.By this time last year, summer already had its two biggest releases; they also proved to be the only ones that passed $400 million domestic. “Guardians” surpassed $300 million this weekend and “Mermaid” has an outside chance of reaching that target; neither has any chance of scoring $400 million.The good news is that while only “Guardians” had an opening three-day weekend over $100 million, with nine wide releases in June several stand an outside shot.Between 2008-2019, every June grossed more than $1 billion — no adjustments required. Despite substantially higher ticket costs, only one month grossed over $1 billion since 2019. (That was July 2022.)It’s possible now: Led by “The Little Mermaid,” and with “Guardians” and “Fast X” still offering some heft, $250 million-$300 million is likely. (By comparison, “Maverick” alone added $362 million in June and was #1 for the month).“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” (Sony, 6/2) is first up among major new releases. A surge in tracking and now very strong reviews suggest an $80 million-$100 million opening. With nearly the whole month to play, it looms as the month’s top grosser.Initial projections have “The Flash” (Warner Bros. Discovery, 6/16) opening around $70 million, although it has the potential to break out within the month’s 15 days of playtime. $150 million for the period sounds like a good starting point.In between, Paramount has “The Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” (6/9). The latest in the Hasbro toy film franchise is more of an international play, but positioned to add $100 million domestic to June’s haul.With its reported $300 million cost, Disney’s “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” has little margin for error. (“The Flash: and “Transformers” are each closer to $200 million.) Only one day’s worth of gross will be included with its June 30 opening, but a strong start could mean $60 million or more.Like “Indiana Jones,” Disney bet on Cannes to boost Pixar’s “Elemental” (6/16). It also received a tepid critical response and suggests that Pixar’s recent issues with audience appeal remain outstanding. Expect $80 million during June. (It cost $175 million).Among the smaller-budget and non-franchise films, none are expected to surpass $50 million during the month. “The Boogeyman” (Disney) is out this Friday. Lionsgate has “The Blackening” (6/16), Universal the animated “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken” (6/30), with Sony presenting the rare comedy with Jennifer Lawrence vehicle “No Hard Feelings” (6/23). A couple of sleepers within this group would be helpful.The month will also see at least two significant specialized entries. Celine Song’s “Past Lives” (A24), the top reviewed film of the year so far, starts its platform run Friday. Its performance will be a significant barometer of life in this struggling sector. Wes Anderson’s “Asteroid City” (Focus) opens on June 16, then goes wide the following week.Plenty of options to choose from, but are they enough to gross $1.2 billion this month? That’s the necessary number if the summer had a shot at $4 billion. We’re going to go with not impossible, but also not likely: At this point, a $3.7 billion summer is closer to reality.",

        "content": "Shia LaBeouf is deepening his knowledge of World War II.After starring as Padre Pio in Abel Ferrara‘s biopic about the Italian monk who rose to fame in Catholicism during the two world wars, LaBeouf is said to be writing a script set in the Holocaust concentration camp Auschwitz, according to the filmmaker.“Padre Pio” director Ferrara told The Film Stage that he is working on the film alongside LaBeouf.“He’s doing real good, man. He’s doing real good. He went off and he did a Coppola movie,” Ferrara said, citing LaBeouf’s role in “Megalopolis.”He continued, “So that was, there was one of those films, right? I mean, ‘Padre Pio’ was 15 days or 20 days and he was in for four so he wasn’t there a long time. But anyway, it was good and he’s working. And we’re working on a film together, he’s writing something about Auschwitz that we’re thinking about doing.”“Padre Pio” was LaBeouf’s first leading role following 2020 abuse allegations by ex-girlfriend FKA Twigs, who sued LaBeouf for sexual battery and emotional distress. LaBeouf was attached to “Don’t Worry Darling” before parting ways with the production.LaBeouf made his feature screenwriting debut with the autobiographical film “Honey Boy,” directed by Alma Har’el, which charted his relationship with an abusive father. The actor later called the script “fucking nonsense” that was not rooted in reality.“My dad was so loving to me my whole life. Fractured, sure. Crooked, sure. Wonky, for sure. But never was not loving, never was not there,” LaBeouf said in 2022. “He was always there… and I’d done a world press tour about how fucked he was as a man. Here’s a man who I’ve done vilified on a grand scale. I turned the knob up on certain shit that wasn’t real. My dad never hit me, never. He spanked me once, one time. And the story that gets painted in ‘Honey Boy’ is this dude is abusing his kid all the time. My dad was going to live with this certain narrative about him on a public scale for a very long time, probably the rest of his life. I wronged him.”",

        "content": "Armie Hammer will not be facing a sexual assault charge in Los Angeles County.After two years of investigation, the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office has decided not to file and prosecute charges against the actor. Hammer was accused of rape by a former partner, identified as Effie, in February 2021. She claimed that Hammer was physically abusive during their four-year-long, on-and-off relationship and that Hammer raped her in 2017.In a statement (via Variety), the Los Angeles D.A.’s office said it could not prove rape allegations beyond a reasonable doubt due to the “complexity of the relationship” between Hammer and accuser Effie. Hammer has denied the allegations.“In this case, those prosecutors conducted an extremely thorough review, but determined that at this time, there is insufficient evidence to charge Mr. Hammer with a crime,” the D.A.’s office said. “As prosecutors, we have an ethical responsibility to only charge cases that we can prove beyond a reasonable doubt…Due to the complexity of the relationship and inability to prove a non-consensual, forcible sexual encounter we are unable to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.”Hammer has not worked in Hollywood since the allegations were made public. The “Social Network” actor was dropped from upcoming films, including Taika Waititi’s “Next Goal Wins,” while rumors of alleged sexual acts surrounding cannibalism and BDSM swirled. He was dropped by his agency, WME, in 2021. In addition to Effie, multiple other women have accused Hammer of abuse.Hammer gave his first interview addressing the allegations in February 2023, opening up about his own childhood sexual abuse and apologizing for past behavior in relationships.“I’m here to own my mistakes, take accountability for the fact that I was an asshole, that I was selfish, that I used people to make me feel better, and when I was done, moved on. And treated people more poorly than they should have been treated,” Hammer told Air Mail. “I would have these younger women in their mid-20s, and I’m in my 30s. I was a successful actor at the time. They could have been happy to just be with me and would have said yes to things that maybe they wouldn’t have said yes to on their own. That’s an imbalance of power in the situation.”",

        "title": "‘Sanctuary’ Avoids the Pitfalls of a Single-Set Movie — Here’s How",
        "content": "In “Sanctuary,” an heir to a hotel chain (Christopher Abbott) and the dominatrix (Margaret Qualley) he pays to act out his submissive fantasies shift into a real-world power struggle when the client wants to end the relationship. The entire film takes place within the confines of an upscale hotel room (with a quick detour into the hallway and elevator), but this is no filmed stage play; director Zachary Wigon and cinematographer Ludovica Isidori’s gorgeous and meticulously conceived visual style makes “Sanctuary” a gloriously cinematic experience that’s as dynamic as it is provocative. Every expressive possibility is seized upon and explored, as Wigon and Isidori consistently find rich visual corollaries for the characters’ internal tensions and shifts in dominance. The movie expertly maximizes the limited resources of an independent film, so IndieWire reached out to Wigon and Isidori to get their tips on how to make the most of space, time, and money.Keep the visual language evolving throughout the filmOne reason “Sanctuary” never becomes boring is that Wigon and Isidori refused to repeat themselves as the film progressed. “In the script, there aren’t any repeating beats,” Wigon said. “Every beat in the story is different in some way, and you’re never in a place that you were earlier in the film. What you’re doing as a director is taking those beats and translating them into cinematic terms with camera movement, blocking, staging, composition, music, and color. By that principle, if every beat is different on the page, then there’s no reason that you should ever be repeating yourself cinematically in your translation.”Early on Wigon and Isidori discussed the fact that the script had several movements that lent themselves to a subtly different visual style. For the opening section, in which the two characters are role-playing according to a predetermined script, Wigon kept the coverage static. “Because they’re trapped and locked, the camera is trapped and locked,” he said. Once the dominatrix departs from the script, the camerawork shifts to Steadicam. “It’s all free-floating because now everything is up in the air. What’s going to happen? Everything is confusing and things are shifting.”Later in “the film”Sanctuary,” when the characters seem to be spiraling, the camera spins out of control with them. “That was the only scene in the movie I didn’t shot list or block,” Wigon said. “It’s just one shot that goes on for about two and a half minutes, and I just told Margaret and Chris to roll with the blocking and the camera operator went handheld and followed them around. And that was right for the feel of that particular sequence, which I wanted to seem particularly unhinged, like anything could happen, like we were off the rails.” This approach extended to every scene in the movie, as Wigon created not only a narrative but a visual progression. “You’re basically trying to read what’s different about each sequence and then go as far as you can stylistically in a way that will support what’s going on. You never want to repeat a frame because as soon as you do, the viewer’s eye starts to say, ‘I’ve seen this before.'”Plan ahead as much as possibleThe precision of the blocking and camera placement in “Sanctuary” is the result of planning and rehearsal, even though Wigon didn’t have much access to his actors ahead of time. “It’s an independent movie, so there wasn’t a lot of time for rehearsal,” Isidori said. Since the actors weren’t available, Wigon and Isidori spent their evenings before production creating a video shot list with whomever they could enlist to stand in for Abbott and Qualley: production assistants, friends, even Wigon’s siblings. “We did it with a phone, just to make sure the editing was working,” Isidori said, adding that they also worked out an overall philosophy for how the characters would move: with a sort of heightened reality motivated by the emotions. “It has a theatricality to it, which is fun as long as it’s in character. We wanted to make sure we were always riding that line and never forcing the movement so that it didn’t make sense. Obviously working with Margaret and Chris there were adjustments on set, but a lot of it was predetermined shot listing night after night with random people.”Create a visually interesting spaceIn keeping with the movie’s sense of heightened reality, Wigon and production designer Jason Singleton conceived of a hotel room set that was more visually diverse than what one would probably find in an actual hotel suite. “There are a lot of contemporary hotel suites where everything is beige,” Wigon said. “That can look nice in real life, but it would be quite boring to look at that for 90 minutes.” Wigon came to Singleton with a concept of the hotel room that had what he described as a “strikingly busy” interior design. “Jason said, ‘We can do something in this universe of busyness, but we’ll need to dial it down by about 20 percent or it’s going to be too much, it’s going to overwhelm the eye.”Isidori collaborated closely with Singleton to control the color in the set and use it as a storytelling tool. “There are two types of color: There’s the color of the room and the color of the lighting,” Isidori said, noting that she carefully controlled both to add further dynamism to the imagery. “The first time you get to the bedroom, it’s warm red tungsten light. The second time there’s a lot of green, which is technically coming in from the outside, but it doesn’t matter where it comes from — the point is that anger and turmoil are bubbling up. The characters are becoming rougher and more unraveled, so I brought in that green to give you an uneasy feeling.” Isidori also did subtle things with the color of the light to underline both differences and connections between the characters. “In the first bathroom scene, they occupy two worlds and their lighting doesn’t necessarily match, but it’s complementary. There are scenes where one character is in blue and the other is red, but there will be a little red in the blue and a little blue in the red, like the colors are leaking into each other’s frames — the colors are contaminating each other.”Save your biggest camera flourishes for when they countAlthough the camerawork never gets in the way of the performances and story, “Sanctuary” does have a few extremely self-conscious shots that make the audience aware of the filmmaking — and that was entirely intentional. “We were not pretending to make a naturalistic movie,” Isidori said. “We’re not pretending the camera is not there. Sometimes it’s going to call attention to itself if it helps support the narrative.” According to Wigon, the more audacious devices — like a shot where the camera inverts, travels from one character to another, and then sets itself upright again — were saved for big dramatic shifts. “You have to pick your moments for fancy business, and usually it’s when you’re delineating new movements in the story,” Wigon said. “Turning moments lend themselves to that kind of stylistic flourish because one chapter is coming to a close and another chapter is opening, and the flourish is a nice way to signify that for the audience.”",

        "title": "‘Twilight,’ Now Restored, Is the Lost Hungarian Murder Mystery Masterpiece You Need to See",
        "content": "Finally, an all-but-lost masterpiece lives again.Hungarian filmmaker György Fehér, a protégé of his fellow countryman and master director Béla Tarr, died in 2002, but more than two decades later, his strange and stirring anti-mystery “Twilight” has been restored for the world to see.You might recognize the story of a retiring detective pulled back in for One Last Job as he’s pushed to obsessive ends over a dead girl found missing in an ominous forest. “Twilight” is based on a 1955 novella by Swiss author Friedrich Dürrenmatt that itself was adapted by Sean Penn into the 2001 film “The Pledge,” starring Jack Nicholson as the wizened alcoholic private eye chasing a serial killer who may or may not exist.In Feher’s “Twilight,” the detective is played by Péter Haumann, and he’s looking for a murderer known only as The Giant and who only seems to exist in scratch drawings made by the local schoolchildren who may be his — or its — next victim. There is an eerie Nabokovian ring to this tale of existential futility as the detective starts inserting himself into the mystery, eventually using a child as bait to catch the killer. And an introducing overhead shot of the forest in which the detective will get very much lost seems to presage the malevolent whoosh-ing of the trees in David Lynch’s “Twin Peaks.” We are in a world of darkness and unknowability, an evil so pervasive it’s sickened even the land’s own flora.Tarr’s trusted cinematographer Miklós Gurbán (“Werckmeister Harmonies,” also on deck for a re-release courtesy of Janus Films this year) shot “Twilight” in underlit crevices and shadows, which made the restoration by the National Institute — Hungarian Film Archive a tricky one, even as Gurbán helped oversee it himself. Arbelos Films is meanwhile handling the nationwide theatrical rollout of the new 4K print.IndieWire spoke to György Ráduly, the director of Hungary’s National Film Institute, about the restoration process and why “Twilight” deserves a place in the film canon. The new 4K print premiered at the Berlinale earlier this year but was otherwise not widely seen outside of Hungary, where it was released in 1990. “The film is a legend. It’s a cult film but it also became a cult film because it was not available for a long time,” Ráduly said.“The film has a very strong power to put you in the chair in a screening room,” Ráduly said, “and the best word for that is the French for assist to the cinema, that when you see these kinds of films, you are not just watching a film. You have to make some effort to get it in yourself, to try to discover the story because it is not explained on a clear narrative level, you have to make your own effort to follow the story, and you’re always surprised. This is a specific European way of making films, not only telling a story to the audience but requesting effort from the audience to get deep inside the movie, and I think this is what happens during the film. As Orson Welles said one time, you don’t have to only watch a film, but using this wonderful French word, you have to assist the screening.”“Twilight” literalizes its opaque storytelling — who is this detective? who is The Giant? where are they in time and space? — through its murky black-and-white images which, watched at home on your television or in the theater, often obscure what they’re trying to convey.“The restoration of this film is typically a challenge in terms of the special grading. It’s a film that was shot voluntarily in very under-lighted conditions. You can see it in the interiors, with almost dark places with little sources of light, like candlelight,” Ráduly said. “All these conditions made the digital restoration quite a challenge because when you’re scanning the films in 4K quality, the problem is always when you have not enough light. When you see the 35mm reference copy of the film, on 35, you have still visible details even in really dark areas. But when you take the [scanned print] and you are going through the color-grading process with the DP, the problem is the black is going down, so we had to work really hard to save the original shades of the grays and the blacks. Miklós wanted to bring back the original characteristics of the film, which means he was always requested more grays, which as you know on digital technology is quite a challenge, so it took a lot of time to make the compromised version that satisfied Miklos and what was feasible with the digital restoration technology.”The Hungarian Film Archive long housed a 35mm copy of the film, as it was the tradition of state-funded projects from the ’40s and into the early 1990s for productions to deposit an original negative to the archive. But a tricky aspect was getting back the rights to the original Dürrenmatt, which weren’t claimed in perpetuity when the film was released in 1990. “We made an agreement with everyone and then we could start the restoration, and we knew that it is going to be something very important for the audience, for the Hungarian audience and internationally as well because the film has not been seen for almost 25 to 30 years,” Ráduly said.As for Sean Penn’s later noir spin on the novella, “The Pledge,” co-written by Polish director Jerzy Skolimowski, Ráduly said that while that 2001 film played in Hungary, audiences hardly made the connection that it was an adaptation of the same book as “Twilight.”“The story is even more interesting now because we can say that this book inspired two great filmmakers, one in Europe and one in America, in different times, and they did a completely different view of how to put it onscreen,” Ráduly said. “It’s always interesting to see both versions, to find out what is the difference between the cinematographic visual universe of a European artist and an American artist.”“Twilight” plays at the American Cinematheque in Los Angeles on June 1, with additional dates to follow from distributor Arbelos Films.",

        "content": "The American Film Institute (AFI) announced today that its AFI AWARDS 2023 honorees-only event will take place on Friday, January 5, 2024, at the Four Seasons Hotel Los Angeles at Beverly Hills.Celebrating the collaborative nature of film and television by honoring talent both above and below the line, AFI AWARDS is one of the few national programs that honors creative teams as a whole. Per the AFI, all the honored works advance the art of the moving image, inspire audiences and artists alike, and enhance the rich cultural heritage of America’s art form.AFI AWARDS selections are made through a jury process where AFI Trustees, artists, critics and scholars determine the year’s most outstanding achievements and provide artistic and cultural context for the selection of each honoree. Submissions and deadlines will be announced in the coming weeks. The honorees will be announced in December 2023.The annual luncheon event is known for its relaxed atmosphere, where talents from in front of and behind the camera can mingle over a celebration of the honored films and TV series. The event usually comes with a surprise speaker to read a benediction; the 2022 event held in January of this year brought Al Pacino to the dais.On the film side, last year AFI honored “Avatar: The Way of Water,” “Elvis,” “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” “The Fabelmans,” “Nope,” “She Said,” “TÁR,” “Top Gun: Maverick,” “The Woman King,” and “Women Talking.” On the TV end, AFI touted “Abbott Elementary,” “The Bear,” “Better Call Saul,” “Hacks,” “Mo,” “Pachinko,” “Reservation Dogs,” “Severance,” “Somebody Somewhere,” and “The White Lotus.” A special award (annually designated to productions not primarily backed by the U.S.) went to “The Banshees of Inisherin.”AFI is meanwhile prepping for its AFI FEST film festival this fall as well as the Life Achievement Award Tribute to Nicole Kidman, which was set for June 10 but is now delayed due to concerns over the strike.",

        "content": "Taika Waititi isn’t trying to build a legacy despite already having one.The “Next Goal Wins” writer-director reflected on his career in a Hollywood Reporter cover story, pointing out that even Michael Curtiz, the filmmaker behind “Casablanca,” has been forgotten by many more than a half-century after helming one of the greatest films of all time. To Waititi, nothing is forever.“I’m 47. My God, take the pressure off,” Waititi said. “People are so obsessed with likes or leaving behind a legacy, being remembered. Here’s the thing: No one’s going to remember us. What’s the name of the director of ‘Casablanca’? Arguably one of the greatest films of all time. No one knows his name. How the fuck do I expect to be remembered? So who cares?”Waititi won a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar in 2020 for “Jojo Rabbit” and is tapped to direct a “Star Wars” installment set for December 2025. Searchlight releases soccer drama “Next Goal Wins” after several delays this November.He added, “Let’s just live, make some movies. They’ll be obsolete and irrelevant in 15 or 20 years. And so will I, and then I’ll die and someone else can do it. This whole idea of chasing, chasing, chasing this life. It’s like, do we have to actually work this hard? Maybe not.”Waititi admitted that early in his career he was convinced that all of his ideas were worthy of being greenlit, citing a kind of self-importance. However, that approach served him well in Hollywood.“I think it’s narcissism, like I was convinced my entire life that all my ideas were great,” the “Thor: Love and Thunder” director said. “I now know they’re not. It was like ‘The Truman Show.’ I used to think everything was put in front of me for my own amusement. And I would be like, ‘Wow, I get to be me, and everyone’s just doing stuff for me.’ And then also that everyone is an idiot, which I still think.”Waititi continued, “I’m like, ‘I’m surrounded by morons. And eventually, they’ll see I’m right.’ It’s a pretty asshole-y thing to say, but it has helped me stick to my guns. With filmmaking, there’s no real trick other than making decisions fast and with confidence. If you asked any director, 85 percent of the time, you have no idea what you’re doing, and you’re just hoping that they don’t find out.”Waititi previously told IndieWire’s Eric Kohn in 2022 that he was grappling with hitting middle age. “Sometimes I feel like maybe I was too busy to notice I was having [a midlife crisis]. Or maybe I’m right in the middle of one,” Waititi said. “I feel like I’m so busy that I have to schedule one. I’ll schedule a time to go buy a Porsche and do all the things I’ve always wanted to do. I’ll get that done so I can go make another movie.”",

        "title": "MoMA Becomes Home to Ken Jacobs, Acquiring Over 200 of His Works",
        "content": "Ken Jacobs is now immortalized as a Museum of Modern Art filmmaker.The experimental Brooklyn-based filmmaker will now have a large collection at the Manhattan museum, making MoMA the singular repository of works of the moving-image artist. The Museum of Modern Art purchased films and videos created by Jacobs, with the titles joining the other 14 Jacobs works already housed at the museum.Jacobs has credited his discovery of the movies to his youthful trips to MoMA in the late 1940s, recalling that “the Museum of Modern Art plunged me, when a teenager, into the unexpectedness of art.”He added in a statement to IndieWire, “Eastern District High School in Williamsburg gave me a pass to MoMA, where I saw ‘Greed,’ Chaplin, Vertov. I’m delighted that MoMA is now acquiring my long life’s cine-output.”For more than 50 years, MoMA has presented Jacobs’ own moving-image work in nearly every context and format, from the theatrical projection of 8mm, 16mm, and 35mm films to cutting-edge computer technologies of his own gallery installations, including “Nervous System” and “Nervous Magic Lantern” performances, and screenings in the Museum’s Sculpture Garden.Jacobs, who turned 90 on May 25, devoted his seven-decade career to the aesthetic, social, and physiological critique of projected images that he manipulates across formats.“As he celebrates his 90th birthday this month, Jacobs is one of cinema’s living treasures, a filmmaker who for the past half-century — together with his partner and collaborator Florence Jacobs — has reawakened the sense of awe and mystery that 19th-century audiences must have felt in confronting motion pictures for the first time,” Joshua Siegel, curator in MoMA’s Department of Film, said.Siegel oversaw the Museum’s acquisition and has organized numerous exhibitions of Jacobs’ work, including (as co-curator) the landmark 2004 series of live performances and screenings “Ken Jacobs: Illusions and Improvisations.”A self-taught filmmaker, Jacobs studied painting with Hans Hofmann at the Art Students’ League of New York in the early 1950s before picking up a movie camera to make a series of New York City street burlesques with the iconic performance artist Jack Smith, including the once-censored “Blonde Cobra” (1963).His first film, “Orchard Street” (1955), captured the tenements of the Lower East Side that reminded Jacobs of his childhood in Depression-era Williamsburg.Though not exclusively part of the new collection, “Orchard Street” has been restored by MoMA and will be presented later this year in the Museum’s Gallery 411, opening on November 3, 2023, together with more recent work, to introduce and reintroduce art-goers to Jacobs’ career.Jacobs later shifted into more politically charged work, culminating in his no-budget magnum opus “Star Spangled to Death,” a vision of American exceptionalism, greed, and intolerance that he built from found footage (Hollywood movies, cartoons, newsreels, and TV shows), jingoistic songs, and performances by Jack Smith and Jerry Sims, interwoven with his own prose. The filmmaker began assembling this material in 1957, expanded and updated it over the next half-century, and completed it in 2004 as a six-and-a-half-hour work.Jacobs blurs the worlds of 2D and 3D space across media to create his own kind of abstract expressionism. He’s long been inspired by the paintings of Jackson Pollock and Joan Mitchell. This is evident in another work that will be on view in Gallery 411, “Joan Mitchell: Departures” (2018), one of Jacobs’ self-described Eternalisms, which explores surface, depth, stasis, and movement.In addition to exhibiting Jacobs’ films, the Museum has also restored several key works beyond “Orchard Street,” including “Tom, Tom, the Piper’s Son” (1969), “Urban Peasants” (1975), and “Perfect Film” (1985).“With this major acquisition of preprint elements, films, and digital works, MoMA will continue to preserve and exhibit Jacobs’ art for future generations,” MoMA curator Siegel said.",

        "content": "Mark Duplass and Sterling K. Brown are seeking best friends for the end of the world.The duo star as lifelong pals who are the last survivors on the planet after the apocalypse in Mel Esyln’s debut feature film “Biosphere,” which premiered at 2022 TIFF. The film is set to be released by IFC Films.Per the official synopsis, in the not-too-distant future, the last two men on Earth must adapt and evolve to save humanity. Billy (Mark Duplass) and Ray (Sterling K. Brown) are lifelong best friends, brothers from another mother — they also happen to be the last two men on earth. Their survival is largely due to Ray, a brilliant scientist who designed the custom biosphere they call home, outfitting it with both creature comforts and the necessities to sustain life on a doomed planet. When the population of their fishpond — which supplies essential protein — begins waning, the men find themselves facing an ominous future. But life may yet find a way.”Director Eslyn is president of Duplass Brothers Productions and produced films such as “The One I Love,” “The Intervention,” “Outside In,” and “Horse Girl.” Eslyn most recently produced HBO comedy “Somebody Somewhere” and Sam Jones’ documentary “Tony Hawk: Until the Wheels Fall Off.” She wrote and directed episodes for HBO’s “Room 104” and helmed docuseries “The Lady and the Dale” and “Cinema Toast.”Eslyn produces “Biosphere” alongside Zackary Drucker, Maddie Buis, and Shuli Harel. Eslyn and “Biosphere” lead star Duplass co-wrote the feature together.The IndieWire review for the film called it “hilarious and earnest,” serving as a “thought experiment about gender and masculinity and (straight) male relationships in microcosm, tossing two cis Western men in the pressure cooker of environmental collapse, where the social constructs that have ceased to matter still occasionally bubble up to the surface.”The review continued, “‘Biosphere’ plays with a central theme of ‘sometimes things happen that can’t be explained rationally’ but doesn’t really go anywhere with it, and some might end up frustrated by where in the narrative the film chooses to end, and which loose threads are left untied. ‘Biosphere’ is tons of fun as a character study, but its ideas will leave you gazing out of its geodesic windows, wishing there was something more out there.”“Biosphere” premieres in theaters and on demand July 7.

        "title": "Memo to Distributors: Buy These 2023 Cannes Movies",
        "content": "This year’s Cannes Film Festival was hardly a letdown from a U.S. distribution standpoint. From Netflix’s surprise acquisition of Todd Haynes’ “May December” to Neon nabbing the Palme d’Or winner “Anatomy of a Fall” and MUBI picking up Aki Kaurismaki’s “Fallen Leaves,” there was no shortage of indications that several Cannes highlights will make their way to American audiences in the months ahead.Nevertheless, this remains a tricky time for anyone in the acquisitions business, and some of the gems from this year’s lineup still need homes. Here are a few key ones for buyers to consider.Ryan Lattanzio contributed to this story.A sweet and shimmeringly beautiful sad hot people film about how life can flow and then freeze and then thaw into something entirely new if you let it, Anthony Chen’s “The Breaking Ice” finds hope in the most frigid of places. In this case, that place is the small Chinese border city of Yanji during the depths of its endless winter, where a love triangle of sorts will form between a prickly tour guide (Zhou Dongyu), a rangy local (Qu Chuxiao), and a suicidal rich boy who’s visiting from Shanghai (Liu Haoran).The Singaporean Chen is something of an outsider to this story himself, and he brings a palpable sense of passing through to a film in which spiritual freedom rubs up against purgatorial immobility. It’s amazing how fast youth can fester when it’s fenced in or denied its future, and “The Breaking Ice” percolates with the leftover energy of people whose collective life force simply won’t let them lie flat and give up.“The Breaking Ice” is an easy movie to love — easier to love than it is to position in a specialized market this hostile towards low-key subtitled fare. But even if a robust arthouse release may not be in the cards for this one, a smart streamer could capitalize on the growing popularity of Chen’s cast, in addition to the director’s own status as an emerging force (his “Drift” premiered at Sundance earlier this year), and scoop in for a quality acquisition that subscribers will eagerly watch, re-watch, and recommend to their friends.  —DESales Contact: Rediance“I love that you never do anything for me…it’s like I don’t even exist.”That’s what Ann, a depressed thirty-something New Yorker, tells her older on-and-off BDSM lover in the first scene of writer-director Joanna Arnow’s “The Feeling That the Time for Doing Something Has Passed,” in which the filmmaker also stars as Ann. Her heroine is an existentially moribund millennial wasting away in an anonymous-feeling corporate job who passes her time with sexual debasement when not quarreling with her nagging Jewish family.This clever and disquieting indie unfolds at a clip somnambulant enough to match its lead’s spiritual stupor, whether she’s spreading her ass for her partners (clients?) or on the phone with her needling mother insisting that, no, she isn’t running out of breath despite trudging up and down the Manhattan streets. (She very much is, and running in place within her life.) Kneejerking viewers might draw a cross between Miranda July mumblecore and Lena Dunham unfilteredness here in terms of Arnow’s willingness to degrade herself on camera, but that’s a comparison the filmmaker would probably be annoyed over and one that elides the movie’s uniquely droll vibe. Still, those comparisons (and the clear-eyed take on a provocative subject matter) should guarantee niche interest in this movie alone. —RLSales Contact: Loco FilmsHirokazu Kore-eda may have slid into the tiniest of slumps after his 2018 masterpiece “Shoplifters” won the Palme d’Or (and raked in more than $3 million at the American box office alone), but the humanist Japanese auteur is still one of the safest bets in the specialized market, as even last year’s “Broker,” which slightly underperformed with critics and wasn’t submitted for the Oscars, earned seven figures in the U.S. with NEON behind it.“Monster,” Kore-eda’s latest, represents both a return to form and a half-step in a new direction: A looping, non-chronological melodrama that starts as a psychological horror movie about a bullied tween before revisiting the same events of its first 45 minutes from a series of different (and more gentle) perspectives. Queer themes emerge as the film circles closer to its core, which allow for a fresh and wholly fitting new avenue for Kore-eda’s career-long embrace of acceptance in all of its forms.With strong reviews and a Best Screenplay prize from Cannes at its back, “Monster” offers distributors a golden opportunity to tap into — and deepen — the strength of Kore-eda’s fanbase, and offer arthouse crowds a movie that will appeal to younger and older crowds alike. —DESales Contacts: GaGa, Wild Bunch InternationalNOTE: Well Go USA acquired U.S. rights after this story ran.The most hardcore food porn this side of “Babette’s Feast” or “Big Night,” and almost certainly the best late ’90s Miramax movie of the 21st century, Tran Anh Hung’s absolutely magnificent “The Pot-au-Feu” would have been a major acquisition had it premiered at Cannes some 25 years ago. A sensual and slow-cooked 19th century romance about France’s most obsessive gastronomy nerd (Benoît Magimel) and the cook who’s shared his kitchen — and occasionally her bedroom — for the last several decades of their lives (Juliette Binoche), Hung’s mouth-watering romance is the kind of movie that might once have played at Lincoln Plaza Cinemas for eight months straight, earning its distributor a massive windfall of passive income in the process.Perhaps the film’s old school charm had something to do with the rapturous reaction that “The Pot-au-Fea” received at Cannes (where it won the Best Director prize), but any cook knows that simple dishes are often the hardest to perfect, and the grace of Hung’s work here shouldn’t go overlooked. This movie should perform well no matter where it plays (future festival berths will only boost its reputation), but it’s also an experience to be savored; it’s a movie that works best in a crowd where everyone can be felt surrendering to its rhythms, oohing and aahing at the various meals together. “The Pot-au-Feu” would be more at home on IMAX than it would on Netflix, so here’s hoping that someone out there gives it the time and the space to bring hungry arthouse audiences to the table. —DESales Contact: GaumontTalia Ryder plays a rebellious teen on a bizarre road trip across America in cinematographer Sean Price Williams’ anarchic debut, written by critic Nick Pinkerton with a funky attitude that scribbles all over the concept of modern-day America with playful glee. As the character careens through a series of unseemly encounters (from Simon Rex as a creepy pedophile and white supremacist to a superficial film shoot), the movie seems game to poke fun at every angle of American identity, from its most horrible extremes to the instinctive repulsion towards people who may be untethered from societal norms rather than conciously rebelling against them.In the hands of a smart distributor, “The Sweet East” has serious Gen-Z appeal, even as it manages to make fun of the same group that might enjoy the wild ride. That’s a tricky balance for wily movie that winks at its audience while punching it in the gut, but the point is that it leaves a mark — which could yield strong word of mouth, and long-term appeal. —EKSales Contact: The Match FactoryA woman with a lost dog, a small girl performing a TikTok dance in a chador, and a worn-out filmmaker trying to get his movie project off the ground are just three of the characters populating the omnibus of single-take vignettes in writer-directors Alireza Khatami and Ali Asgari’s “Terrestrial Verses.” Combined, these nine stories give off a powerful cumulative effect as we see the petty bureaucracies and paper-pushing quotidian blocks to working-class life unfold and whittle these people down. Cultural, religious, and institutional constraints wear down everyday citizens in Tehran in stories that may lack a beginning, middle, or end but still arrive at a well-drawn if eerie and ambiguous conclusion that would feel dystopic if the events weren’t so ordinary.The sole Iranian entry in the 2023 Cannes Official Selection, “Terrestrial Verses” opens with a panoramic, widescreen shot of the Tehran cityscape. At first gently and then overwhelmingly, the swell and clatter of urban noise, and eventually screaming and sirens and the sounds of panic, fill the scene before a cut-to-black that introduces us to the film’s first character. A new father (Bahram Ark) is told that the name he and his wife has chosen for their infant child, David, is too Western, and unseen lawmen says the government won’t approve their choice. Most of the vignettes are established talking-head documentary interview style, with the interviewers (in the form of police or government pencil pushers) placed behind the camera and never seen.The film’s rather harrowing takedown of the Iranian-Islamic regime should resonate with cinephiles keen on the works of Jafar Panahi and Mohammad Rasoulof, whose equally outspoken views on the political paradigms churning against them landed the filmmakers in prison and prevented Rasoulof from participating in this year’s Un Certain Regard jury. (“Terrestrial Verses” was part of that selection.) —RLSales Contact: Films Boutique",

Like you ever thought about Ken before this?” Gosling told GQ in a cover story.He continued, “And everyone was fine with that, for him to have a job that is nothing. But suddenly, it’s like, ‘No, we’ve cared about Ken this whole time.’ No, you didn’t. You never did. You never cared. Barbie never fucked with Ken. That’s the point.”Gosling added, “If you ever really cared about Ken, you would know that nobody cared about Ken. So your hypocrisy is exposed. This is why his story must be told.”The “Notebook” actor summed up, “I would say, you know, if people don’t want to play with my Ken, there are many other Kens to play with.”Gosling previously shared that Ken has a “hard” life since he’s “got no money, he’s got no job, he’s got no car, he’s got no house” in the film.“I felt like I was seeing myself. I felt seen,” Gosling said earlier this year. “I think a lot of Kens will feel seen when they see this. Gotta do it for the Kens. Nobody plays with the Kens.”Case in point: Gosling’s own two daughters disrespecting their Ken doll at his house.“I walk out in the backyard and, do you know where I found Ken, Jimmy? Face down in the mud next to a squished lemon,” Gosling recalled. The image in part led him to sign onto the film: He took a photo of what he found and texted it to Gerwig saying, “‘I shall be your Ken, for this story must be told.'”For all the details on “Barbie,” click here.",

        "title": "‘Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse’ Review: A Dazzling Reminder of What Superhero Movies Can Be",
        "content": "“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” is awash in stories — its first five or so minutes, an ostensible prologue, is a dynamic tragedy in miniature, and that’s just the first five minutes — all built around an idea one of its characters tosses out during a similarly information-packed voiceover: They’re going to “do things differently.” It’s precisely what the film‘s predecessor, the rightly Oscar-winning “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” did four years ago, taking a well-worn concept (a Spider-Man origin story? again?) and turning it into an actual masterpiece built on a wealth of stories, new and old, told with legitimate energy and innovation. And it’s what Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, and Justin K. Thompson attempt to replicate in their sequel, an aim that pays off mightily.Set a year after “Into the Spider-Verse,” “Across the Spider-Verse” makes a pit stop with Gwen Stacy (voiced by Hailee Steinfeld) before checking in with our hero Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) and further pulling tight the duo’s special bond as Spider-Woman and Spider-Man, respectively. Since we last left her, Gwen’s universe has grown still more complicated — girl, aren’t they all? — but other issues beyond her own web-based problems have kept her from skipping through the multiverse to see Miles in his. Per that packed prologue, Gwen soon finds herself fighting alongside Miguel O’Hara (a dark and haunter vampire ninja Spider-Man, voiced by Oscar Isaac) and Jessica Drew (an ebullient, heavily pregnant, and motorcycle-riding Spider-Woman, voiced by Issa Rae), who arrive in her universe to essentially clean up some multiverse-threatening collateral damage from all the wild stuff that happened in the first film. Eventually, the bad-ass duo take her into their crime-fighting fold when they realize how dangerous this particular world has become to ol’ Spider-Gwen.They’re part of the Spider-Society, and while we won’t get a real sense of the dazzling scope of that particular group — all Spider-People, all the time — until the film’s full-to-bursting third act, it’s very much worth the wait. (But we won’t even wait to say more in the context of this review, because it’s simply too good. It would be impossible to name even a fraction of the different Spideys who pop up throughout the film at large and the Society in particular after just one viewing — every frame involving the various webheads is packed with jokes, gags, entertainment, and information — but suffice it to say, if there’s a particular flavor of Spider-Man you’re looking for here, you’re probably going to get him/her/them. LEGO Spider-Man! Spider-Man as a car. Spider-Cat! Spider-Cowboy! Spider-uhhh-T.Rex! Spider-Everyone, OK? Now back to it.)In Miles’ own world, things are going mostly alright. He’s a bit stretched by the whole being-Spider-Man and also being-a-totally-normal-teen thing, but which iteration of Spidey hasn’t endured such worries in the course of this iconic tale? When a wacky new baddie shows up (his name is Spot, he’s voiced by Jason Schwartzman, he is perfect), Miles takes this particular “villain of the week” in stride.That’s just about the worst thing he could do to Spot, who is filled with ineffectual rage, an insatiable hunger to pump up his own powers, and a burning desire to punish Miles, who he believes is responsible for his predicament. “I am your nemesis!” Spot frequently yells at Miles, who spends the majority of their first battle texting with his parents (diss!). But that also means it’s far too late when he realizes that Spot actually is someone to be afraid of.The multiverse is already in a tenuous state, and Spot’s growing ability to create his own portals, skipping and jumping between worlds at whim, is about to crack it even further. And that’s just one part of this story, written by producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller (plus “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” scribe David Callaham) and content to grow and mature right alongside Miles.“Into the Spider-Verse” was astute and funny, complicated and emotional, unique and daring, and its sequel only grows and expands on those aims. If the first film showed what superhero movies could be, “Across the Spider-Verse” goes even further: It shows what they should be. In a genre built on the literally super and special, these films are unafraid to stand out and do something truly different, something that pushes the limits, to show the genuine range available to this subset of stories and feel damn good in the process (and look, dare we say, even better).Much of that is surely due to their distinct animation style, which in its second iteration, looks even more stunning, more tactile, more real in its distinct unreality, because all that jaw-dropping animation is truly in service to the story and its emotions. Colors and shadows, a flick of an eye and the flex of a hand, comic book panel-styled intertitles and zingy asides, all of it exists to advance the tale, not distract from it. Action sequences unfold with their own kinetic logic yet remain fully coherent (something the vast majority of our current crop of live-action blockbusters can’t claim) and engaging to the point that audiences might forget to breathe during them.And Dos Santos, Kemp, Thompson, and their mighty band of animators don’t skimp on them at all, every action-packed sequence — from a lovely bit that sees Miles and Gwen reuniting while webbing through the city, to a last-act chase that involves a dizzying amount of players and goes on for twice as long as most movies would dare — is still thrilling from top to bottom. It’s an eye-popping visual feast and a satisfying one to boot. Why can’t all blockbusters even attempt half as much as what “Across the Spider-Verse” puts, so lovingly and so smartly, into all of its setpieces?When Gwen finally arrives back in Miles’ world, she’s forced to hide nearly all of her motivations from her Spider-BFF, who mostly just wants to hang out with her (and, later, his delightfully sarcastic mentor, Peter B. Parker, voiced by Jake Johnson) and can’t quite see just how much his world (his very universe) is hanging in the balance. Miles has always been exceptional to the point of being the exception, and while he might believe that being part of something bigger, perhaps in the form of the Spider-Society, is the ticket, he’s about to learn that’s simply not the case. As high-flying and heart-pumping as Miles’ next chapter is, it also cleverly moves toward a series of massive reveals — the kind that feel earned, the kind that feel personal and inevitable, a far cry from the what-if-the-whole-universe-was-gonna-be-destroyed boredom and uniformity that plague so much of this genre — that speak to the distinctive pleasures of this franchise.What is Miles really going up against? Nothing less than — pause to really let this part sink in — the canon itself. No, really, the very thing that Miguel O’Hara and Jess Davies and Gwen and Peter B. Parker and the rest of the Spider-Society are tasked with holding together is the canon. For comic book fans, the implications are clear: the canon is made up of all those accepted, classic, traditional stories, the backbone of the superhero universe, the stuff you don’t want to mess up or go against or break outright. Miles Morales, from his very creation both in the comic books and on the big screen, is a new twist on the canon. A Spider-Man who isn’t Peter Parker? Who is from Brooklyn? Who is mixed race? If you’re still clutching your pearls over the creation of these kinds of characters or review-bombing a film because it dared to cast a person of a different color or gender than you wanted or yelling about this sort of demented ideology on social media or whatever it is you do with your precious time on Earth, “Across the Spider-Verse” has got a hell of a message for you. Breaking the canon? It’s the only way to move forward.That’s not something Miguel and company (with some notable exceptions, including the Daniel Kaluuya-voiced anarchist Brit Spider-Punk) are ready to hear, if only because they’ve become convinced of the power of Spider-Man’s mythology to quite literally hold the multiverse together. Miles, at first purely on accident and then totally by force of will, cannot abide by living the same beats as the rest of his brethren, and that puts him on a staggering crash-course with just about everyone and everything. Miles has always broken the mold, and once he sees the mold itself, he’s gotta do it again, his way.And if all of this sounds like a tremendous amount to pack into a single film, there’s the rub. In a somewhat disappointing twist, “Across the Spider-Verse” isn’t really a single film, it’s instead one-half of a planned two-film sequel. The decision to split the sequel into two films seems to have been lost on plenty of fans. Lord and Miller announced the two-part sequel, complete with “Part One” and “Part Two” title addendums, back in December 2021. By April 2022, the two films had been renamed “Across the Spider-Verse” and “Beyond the Spider-Verse,” a move that seems to have caused the bulk of the confusion. Even in this critic’s well-attended screening, the end reveal that this story is very much not over was met with cocked heads.It’s a heck of a problem: to simply have too much good stuff to stuff into just one film, leaving the audience on tenterhooks for when they can see this particular superhero story actually wrap up (it’s March 29, 2024, by the way). It’s the only thing about “Into the Spider-Verse” that feels familiar, too, a choice that puts it on the “Fast X” or “Harry Potter” or “The Hunger Games” route, with one exception: this conclusion will surely be worth the wait.Sony Pictures Animation releases “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” in theaters on Friday, June 2.",

        "content": "Channing Tatum fears that the golden era of content has already had its last dance.The “Magic Mike’s Last Dance” star spoke out on the rise of streaming platforms and the subsequent decline in quality content in a new interview with Forbes.“The movie industry is just changing so much,” Tatum said. “It’s a different era now and it’s just getting crazier with the streamers. I do fear a little for the storytelling of it all. I think there will be less good storytelling and a lot more product out there.”Tatum reflected on 2015 film “Magic Mike XXL” being driven by the bottom line more than the movie itself.“We made ‘Magic Mike 2 ‘for $12 million dollars and they spent $60-$70 million dollars to sell it. So, we’re spending exponentially more money to sell a movie than actually make the thing for you. That should be the other way around,” Tatum said. “We could be spending the money on the thing that the viewer is actually going to get to see and now it’s just who can create the most noise to break through the cataclysmic wave of content coming out every single day.”The “Pussy Island” actor confirmed that his upcoming “Ghost” remake will instead be focused on the level of storytelling worthy of revisiting the beloved film, saying, “‘Ghost’ is really getting somewhere we can really be proud of and really want to go make.”Oscar winner Quentin Tarantino recently spoke out against streamers like Netflix for greenlighting big-budget films that “don’t exist in the zeitgeist.”“I mean, and I’m not picking on anybody, but apparently for Netflix, Ryan Reynolds has made $50 million on this movie and $50 million on that movie and $50 million on the next movie for them,” Tarantino said at 2023 Cannes. “I don’t know what any of those movies are. I’ve never seen them. Have you? I haven’t ever talked to Ryan Reynolds’ agent, but his agent is like, ‘Well, it cost $50 million.’ Well, good for him that he’s making so much money. But those movies don’t exist in the zeitgeist. It’s almost like they don’t even exist.”",

        "title": "Ezra Miller Won’t Be Recast in Potential ‘Flash’ Sequel, Says Director: They ‘Excelled’ in the Role",
        "content": "Ezra Miller will not be cast out of the DCU in a multiverse loophole, according to “The Flash” director Andy Muschietti.Miller, who has faced multiple arrests and allegations of cult-like behavior and grooming, leads upcoming DC tentpole film “The Flash,” which co-stars Michael Keaton and Ben Affleck and opens the door to various actors portraying the same characters in different iterations. While “The Flash” has already received outstanding first reaction reviews, calls for Miller’s casting to be reexamined have plagued the film due to the non-binary star’s troubled public profile.Yet director Muschietti assured that if a sequel to “The Flash” is greenlit, Miller will continue in the lead role. “If [a sequel] happens, yes,” Muschietti said during “The Discourse” podcast (via The Playlist). “I don’t think there’s anyone that can play that character as well as they did. The other depictions of the character are great, but this particular vision of the character, they just excelled in doing it.”Muschietti continued, “And, as you said, the two Barrys — it feels like a character that was made for them.”Producer Barbara Muschietti also shared, “In principal photography, Ezra was brilliant and the most committed and the most professional [actor]. Ezra gave everything for this role – physically, creatively, emotionally. They were absolutely supreme.”Miller’s “The Flash” co-star Michael Shannon called working with the actor a “lovely” experience, saying earlier this year that Miller was a “very kind” scene partner.“It’s difficult to talk about, but I always give people a lot of slack in this business, because there’s a lot of people in this business that have issues. And some people have more privacy than others,” Shannon said. “Any time somebody is out in the spotlight getting picked on, I feel for them. Even if it’s warranted, it’s still a horrible situation.”Miller issued a statement in August 2022 apologizing for their actions and announcing they were seeking mental health treatment. Warner Bros.’ DC Studios co-head Peter Safran shared in January 2023 that Miller was “completely committed to their recovery” and that the studio was “fully supportive of that journey that they’re on right now.”",

        "title": "I Took My Daughters, 3 and 6, to See ‘The Little Mermaid.’ Here’s Who Slept and Who Danced in the Aisles",
        "content": "My 3-year-old’s poor, unfortunate soul.On Saturday, the family Maglio — me, my wife, and our two daughters, aged 3 and 6 — reclined for the 2:45 P.M. showing of “The Little Mermaid” at the Cinemark Hazlet 12 in Hazlet, New Jersey. Well, the 3-year-old didn’t move her chair; upright, it was already like a queen-sized bed to her. Plus, she ended up spending the vast majority of the movie on my wife’s lap. (More on that in a bit.)For the 6-year-old, it was just her second time in a theater for a movie; her first experience was “Frozen II.” Then the pandemic hit, and her little sister rounded out the family. For the 3-year-old, Memorial Day Weekend 2023 marked her first time in an actual movie theater.Our older princess is very much into Disney Princesses, so she has been looking forward to this for a while. The younger one is happy to tag along and pretends she loves what her big sister is into, though she’s more of a “Paw Patrol” girl at heart.(A quick aside about that: As I told Paramount Pictures boss Chris Aronson at CinemaCon, the opening scene of the first “Paw Patrol” movie scares the little one so much she doesn’t want to see the sequel. If you don’t remember the scene, a trucker hauling maple syrup swerves to avoid a baby turtle and jackknifes his rig on the Adventure Bay bridge. The turtle was completely fine; as was the truck driver, voiced by Tyler Perry, thanks to Chase and the gang. It’s not really that scary a scene and it plays out the same way each time.)As excited as my 6-year-old was to see “Ariel” (as she calls “The Little Mermaid”), her mom, my wife, may have been more so — she turned 6 herself the month after the O.G. “Little Mermaid” release. The timing for these remakes is no coincidence.“The Little Mermaid” (2023) benefits from the same good timing as “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” (2023). The original “Super Mario Bros.” Nintendo Entertainment System game came out in 1985; many of us who played the game in the mid-’80s, when it was a legitimate phenomenon, now have kids old enough to play the new games via the ongoing platformer and its many spinoffs (we’re up to eight “Mario Kart” games alone). And those kids are certainly old enough to watch the Chris Pratt-led animated movie, a true box-office blockbuster, rated PG. (And we were just old enough to realize we all hated the 1993 live-action “Super Mario Bros.” movie, also rated PG.)What my kids are not old enough to watch at present is “The Kardashians.” Random, right? So was the promo for the Hulu series that ran ahead of “The Little Mermaid.” Seeing Kim and Khloe’s antics was confusing at best for the young children in the theater — and annoying to the groaning parents — but Disney gonna synergy, I suppose. My daughter liked them, probably because they look like Barbie dolls. Thanks, Disney.But while that was the most egregiously out-of-place spot to play ahead of Cinderella’s Castle and the new Disney 100 branding, both promising the feature presentation had finally arrived, overall there were way too many ads and previews for the youngest kiddos there to see a PG matinee. (Of course, really, they were there at least half for the snacks. And you’d better pack heavy for “The Little Mermaid,” which has a too-long two-hour, 15-minute running time.)For my kids, the confusion continued soon after “Mermaid” finally rolled. “This isn’t what happens,” my older one leaned over toward me, not exactly whispering over the movie’s opening scene. Kids, including not-mine, don’t quite grasp the whole the-theater-isn’t-your-living-room handshake agreement that comes with a ticket purchase — especially those who have lived half (or more) of their lives under COVID protocols.That part isn’t necessarily a Disney problem, it’s a young child problem that Disney does continual battle with. You see, their little brains (the kids, not the Disney Imagineers) favor repetition and predictability over new ideas and creativity. That’s why you listen to the same songs over and over again and watch the same movies, TV episodes, and YouTube videos until you can recite them in your sleep. It’s also why remakes work on the little ones.I, a 41-year-old man who never saw “The Little Mermaid” until maybe four years ago and has since seen it probably 20 times (and the straight-to-VHS sequels, prequels, and spinoffs now populating the Disney+ library), see no reason for a live-action version of “Lion King” or “The Little Mermaid” or “The Jungle Book,” etc. We have them already — and they work. The small ones crave the storyline and character familiarity (though I had to point out who Prince Eric was to my older daughter); it’s comforting. It’s like eating the same three foods over and over and over again, which they also do.What was neither appreciated nor comforting to our 3-year-old was what the live-action version of the shark chasing Ariel and Flounder looked like. That’s the rub of live-action remakes: cartoons don’t really freak kids out because their action is recognizably not real. (Minus one aforementioned baby turtle for our baby, I suppose, but CGI animation has more realism than hand-drawn.) Old-school Disney classics are what kids would draw if they could draw better than kids.Ursula was another problem for her, and my older one did not love the shipwreck scene. I suspect the life-like danger might be exciting for a slightly older demo of kids; we’re not there yet. The younger one sought safety in my wife’s lap. And then she turned her new seat into an actual bed fit for a queen. By the big storm, my 3-year-old was fast asleep, with the angry sea serving as her white noise.The 3 o’clock nap is not really an indictment on the movie (though perhaps it is an indictment on the length of the previews). I think it’s probably more about the busy morning we had. She’s also still napping at daycare but not at home. You just never know what you’re going to get in the afternoons.The 6-year-old settled in for the long haul. For “Under the Sea,” she was dancing in her seat. By “Kiss the Girl” (and for each subsequent song), she took her dancing to the aisle. I’m not sure if that’s allowed, but it was cute. She did not have much use for the new original songs — again, repetition wins.Character-wise, the grownups all seemed to like Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy as Ariel and Ursula, respectively. I think the kids liked Bailey; or at least they certainly weren’t thrown at all by the online nonsense some adults seem unable to get past. Sebastian (voiced by Daveed Diggs) and Scuttle (Awkwafina) were standouts for all. IndieWire’s own Kate Erbland accurately described Flounder’s “newly flattened fish visage” as “truly terrifying” (though it’s probably not as creepy as the dead-eyed Flounder from ABC’s “The Little Mermaid Live!” in 2019.)In her review, Erbland gave the new “Little Mermaid” a “C+,” which is probably in the ballpark of where our younger one would go if she understood letter grades. Our older one might filet Erbland for that grade; she immediately asked to watch it again the next day on Disney+. Honey, this isn’t 2021. Let Daddy teach you all about a concept we had when he was a kid: Theatrical windows.",

        "title": "The Best Movies of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, According to 60 Critics",
        "content": "Just like last year, critics are quibbling with the film awarded the Palme d’Or. Not that there’s active dislike for Justine Triet’s “Anatomy of a Fall,” but the Palme d’Or winner topped a different category in the survey IndieWire sent to critics from all over the world. This time, 60 reviewers and journalists participated, with five continents represented.Nearly half of all 60 voted for Jonathan Glazer’s loose Martin Amis adaptation, Holocaust drama “The Zone of Interest“: 29 of the critics voted for it for Best Film. That’s a divergence with the Competition jury, which voted “Zone of Interest” the Grand Prix while “Anatomy of a Fall” took the Palme. The second title for Best Film chosen by the critics only received six votes, showing the intensity of enthusiasm for the Glazer film. That second title was Aki Kaurismaki’s “Fallen Leaves,” with “Anatomy of a Fall” placing third (receiving five votes).“Killers of the Flower Moon” and “The Pot-au-Feu” rounded out the Top 5, and placed even higher on the Best Directed Film list.Such a divergence is not uncommon: Lukas Dhont’s “Close” and Park Chan-wook’s “Decision to Leave” placed higher on the critics’ best film list last year, with that year’s Palme placing fourth.“Anatomy of a Fall” certainly did get major love from our critics, topping our Best Screenplay poll. This is quite revealing: celebrated for its writing, “Anatomy of a Fall” got 18 out of 60 votes for Best Screenplay. “The Zone of Interest,” on the other hand, only received one vote out of 60 for Best Screenplay and didn’t come close to cracking that category.Our critics seem to be able to separate their appreciation of great writing from a film’s other formal qualities with great precision: “May December” and “Monster” rounded out the Best Screenplay category but only “May December” appears on another list.On the other hand, Glazer won the top spot via quite the margin yet again for Best Directed Film. There, “The Zone of Interest” took 19 of the overall 60 possible votes. Again, quite a jump over the film to place second: “Killers of the Flower Moon,” with six votes.There was a three-way tie for third place for Best Directed Film: Alice Rohrwacher’s “La Chimera,” Todd Haynes’ “May December,” and Tran Anh Hung’s “The Pot-au-Feu.”For the first time, IndieWire asked the critics to choose Best First Film at Cannes as well. Two films each got 11 votes to tie for the honor: Ramata-Toulaye Sy’s “Banel and Adama” and Molly Manning Walker’s “How to Have Sex.”See the full results below. For more of IndieWire’s Cannes coverage, go here.1. “The Zone of Interest,” Jonathan Glazer\n2. “Fallen Leaves,” Aki Kaurismaki\n3. “Anatomy of a Fall,” Justine Triet\n4. “Killers of the Flower Moon,” Martin Scorsese\n5. “The Pot-au-Feu,” Tran Anh Hung1. “Anatomy of a Fall,” Justine Triet and Arthur Harari\n2. “May December,” Samy Burch and Alex Mechanik\n3. “Monster,” Yuji Sakamoto1. “The Zone of Interest,” Jonathan Glazer\n2. “Killers of the Flower Moon,” Martin Scorsese\n(tie) 3. “La Chimera,” Alice Rohrwacher\n(tie) 3. “May December,” Todd Haynes\n(tie) 3. “The Pot-au-Feu,” Tran Anh Hung(tie) “Banel and Adama,” Ramata-Toulaye Sy\n(tie) “How to Have Sex,” Molly Manning Walker",

        "title": "John Cleese Has ‘No Intention’ of Cutting Controversial ‘Life of Brian’ Scene for Revival",
        "content": "John Cleese is clarifying the status of a controversial and allegedly transphobic scene in film “Life of Brian.”Cleese, who confirmed he is adapting the 1979 comedy into a stage play, responded to a Daily Mail report claiming that he was strongly encouraged to cut a sequence involving a man asking to be called Loretta and talking about wanting to give birth.The “Monty Python” star took to Twitter to slam the “misreporting” over the scene potentially being cut to appease modern audiences.“A few days ago I spoke to an audience outside London. I told them I was adapting the ‘Life of Brian’ so that we could do it as a stage show (NOT a musical),” Cleese wrote. “I said that we’d had a table-reading of the latest draft in NYC a year ago. All the actors — several of them Tony winners — had advised me strongly to cut the Loretta scene. I have, of course, no intention of doing so.”Cleese added that the request to cut the Loretta scene is “ridiculous” and a reaction to potentially alienating ticket buyers.“These were absolutely top-class Broadway performers and they were adamant that we would not get away with doing the scene in NYC!” Cleese tweeted. “Producers tend to be scaredy-cats, and they don’t remember that the protests in NYC when ‘Brian’ was released meant we never needed to do publicity!!”Cleese, who was accused of being transphobic in 2020 after defending J.K. Rowling, has been adamant that “cancel culture” has curbed creativity in the comedic landscape, saying in 2022, “If you’re worried about offending people and constantly thinking of that, you are not going to be very creative. So I think it has a disastrous effect.”Cleese continued at the time, “I think it’s particularly worrying at the moment because you can only create in an atmosphere of freedom, where you’re not checking everything you say critically before you move on. What you have to be able to do is to build without knowing where you’re going because you’ve never been there before. That’s what creativity is — you have to be allowed to build.

        "title": "Martin Scorsese Teases New Movie About Jesus After Meeting with Pope",
        "content": "Martin Scorsese already has a few ideas for his next project lined up — he could direct a Grateful Dead biopic with Jonah Hill or re-team with Leonardo DiCaprio on another David Grann adaptation. But it sounds like the 80-year-old director might be setting his sights on another film about one of his favorite subjects: religion.The auteur followed his trip to Cannes — where “Killers of the Flower Moon” premiered out of competition to rapturous reviews — with a tour of Italy, where he is hosting screenings of several of his films and conducting a master class for students at the Centro Sperimentale film school.He also found time to visit the Vatican for a conference titled “The Global Aesthetics of the Catholic Imagination,” which saw prominent Catholic artists from around the world discussing ways to explore faith in their work. Variety reports that Scorsese also had a private audience with Pope Francis and announced his plan to make a new film about Jesus Christ at the event.“I have responded to the Pope’s appeal to artists in the only way I know how: by imagining and writing a screenplay for a film about Jesus,” Scorsese said at his press conference. “And I’m about to start making it.”Scorsese has directed three films about religion — “The Last Temptation of Christ,” “Kundun,” and “Silence” — and touched on issues of faith and spirituality in many other movies. In a 2017 interview, he revealed that he once came close to making a film about Jesus’ life that was set in New York City.“The popular representation of Jesus in the mind of the average moviegoer was coming out of Cecil B. DeMille. Pretty much all films made on religious subject matter were biblical epics. And the best one, of course, was Pasolini’s ‘Gospel According to St. Matthew,’” he said. “My original idea was in the early ‘60s. I had realized you could start making films with 16-millimeter black-and-white, because of John Cassavetes doing ‘Shadows,’ and I had a dream that I could maybe make a film someday. And immediately I thought of making a film of the Gospel, but set on the Lower East Side, in the tenements, in modern dress. And the crucifixion would be on the West Side docks, and in black-and-white.”",

        "title": "Cannes 2023: The 14 Best Movies at This Year’s Festival",
        "content": "This year’s Cannes has come to an end, but its ripple effects will be felt across the rest of the year, as the the 2023 edition of the ultra-prestigious festival played host to a deep and extraordinary array of premieres from some of the world’s greatest filmmakers, several of whom were debuting new work for the first time in the better part of a decade (or longer). In most cases, the wait proved worth it. “The Zone of Interest” director Jonathan Glazer stunned the Croisette with his much-anticipated follow-up to 2013’s “Under the Skin,” while the likes of Aki Kaurismäki, Catherine Breillat, Tran Anh Hung, and Martin Scorsese — whose epic “Killers of the Flower Moon” only felt like it was forever in the making — all returned with major triumphs that reminded us of their singular brilliance (apologies to Victor Erice, whose rapturously received but inconveniently scheduled “Close Your Eyes” eluded our team on the ground). Even Cannes mainstays like Hirokazu Kore-eda, Wes Anderson, and Palme d’Or-winner Justine Triet seemed to be reinvigorated and compelled to push themselves further out of their comfort zones than ever before, while newcomers like Camera d’Or-winner Thien An Pham (“Inside the Yellow Cocoon Shell) and relatively unheralded talents like Anthony Chen (“The Breaking Ice”) unveiled films that could easily stand shoulder-to-shoulder with those from giants of the medium. There may not have been another “Aftersun,” but there’s no use complaining about that in the wake of a festival that gave us the first “Robot Dreams.”Here are the 14 best films we saw at Cannes 2023.This article includes contributions from Siddhant Adlakha, Christian Blauvelt, Ben Croll, Sophie Monks Kaufman, Eric Kohn, and Josh Slater-Williams. At nearly 200 minutes in length, “About Dry Grasses” is par for the course for Turkish virtuoso Nuri Bilge Ceylan. He returns, once again, to the icy frost of his Anatolia-set Palme d’Or winner “Winter Sleep,” for a story that beats with similar frustrations towards power in the grand social scheme. However, he weaves this theme into his background tapestry, favoring instead a talkative and often discomforting tale of a small-town art teacher, his 12-year-old female student, and an accusation of impropriety that might be false on its surface, but is rooted in truths the camera sees. Where “Winter Sleep” adapted Russian greats like Chekhov and Dostoyevsky — it draws from both “The Wife” and “The Brothers Karamazov”— “About Dry Grasses” plays like a spiritual descendant of Nabokov’s “Lolita,” at least in its use of point-of-view. Ceylan’s novelistic approach to cinema could perhaps find no more fitting a partner than Nabokov’s lyricism, the kind that is at once cinematic in spirit, and yet wholly difficult to adapt for the screen.Ceylan’s latest takes a similarly imaginative, poetic approach to everything from the dull and mundane to the downright sordid, filtering a distasteful story of a man beset by rural frustrations through a surprisingly personal lens, one that keeps things frequently intriguing, occasionally electric, and altogether challenging. It’s only toward the very end of the movie’s 3 hours and 17 minutes that one feels the weight of its running time, by which point anything approaching emotional oppressiveness becomes added emphasis — an exclamation point at the end of its protagonist’s narcissistic screed. —SAThey say trends come in threes. And so, nipping on the heels of Alice Diop’s “Saint Omer” and Cedric Kahn’s Directors’ Fortnight breakout “The Goldman Case,” Justine Triet’s Palme d’Or-winning “Anatomy of a Fall” make a compelling case that the courthouse has become the most fertile ground in contemporary French cinema, offering incisive auteurs both motive and opportunity to put social structures on trial. As it calls the institution of marriage to the stand, Triet’s piercing film holds the ambient tensions and illogical loose ends of domestic life against the harsh and rational light of a legal system that searches for order in chaos.Rounding out her own impressive hat trick, “Toni Erdmann” and “The Zone of Interest” star Sandra Hüller dazzles in a role clearly written with the performer in mind. She plays Sandra, a German-born, France-based bisexual novelist accused of killing her male partner in a way eerily foretold by one of her novels. And if that description calls to mind another icy-blond (in a performance, incidentally, that also shook the Cannes Film Festival, back in 1992), the echo is both wholly intentional and entirely irrelevant. Indeed, “Anatomy of a Fall” is filled with such anti-portents –coincidences or clues, depending on who you ask, echoes or empty noise, depending on who’s listening.“Anatomy of a Fall” is never really about the trial that follows; at its searing best, the film tracks the destruction of a family with cold precision. If an artist relies on memories, why not also share nightmares? Why not build a polar vortex that crushes fact under fiction, that lifts from last night’s argument, today’s viewing of a ’90s classic and tomorrow’s worst fears? It’s a cyclone that sends the mind soaring, and primes the heart for a hefty fall. —BCLike any movie by Wes Anderson, “Asteroid City” is the epitome of a Wes Anderson movie. A film about a television program about a play within a play “about infinity and I don’t know what else” (as one character describes it), this delightfully profound desert charmer about a group of people trapped in a tiny Southwestern outpost during a 1955 science convention — by far the director’s best effort since “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” and in some respects the most poignant thing he’s ever made — boasts all of his usual hallmarks and then some. As expected, the world of “Asteroid City” is meticulously arranged with clockwork precision, and — as expected — that world is then populated with memorable characters who try to assert the same degree of control over their own lives. So far, so typical. But then, in one brilliant stroke, what seems like just another immaculate Wes Anderson movie suddenly becomes one of a kind, as “Asteroid City” spins in a cosmic new direction that forces all of its characters to abandon their delusions of authority. It’s maybe the most radical thing that has ever happened in one of his movies — the sort of transformative moment that A.I. could never dream up no matter how much data it ingested — and it tees up a dreamlike and profoundly moving story that finds something beautiful about surrendering to the great unknown. —DEA sweet and shimmeringly beautiful sad hot people film about how life can flow and then freeze and then thaw into something entirely new if you let it, Anthony Chen’s “The Breaking Ice” finds hope in the most frigid of places. In this case, that place is the small Chinese border city of Yanji during the depths of its endless winter, when people’s breath is as thick as the gray fumes that spew out of the factory smokestacks, and the snowy peak of Changbai Mountain looks closer to heaven than it does to Pyongyang. It’s there, against the most inhospitable of backdrops, that a love triangle of sorts will form between a prickly tour guide (Zhou Dongyu), a rangy local (Qu Chuxiao), and a suicidal rich boy who’s visiting from Shanghai (Liu Haoran). The Singaporean Chen is something of an outsider to this story himself, and he brings a palpable sense of passing through to a film in which spiritual freedom rubs up against purgatorial immobility. It’s amazing how fast youth can fester when it’s fenced in or denied its future, and “The Breaking Ice” percolates with the leftover energy of people whose collective life force simply won’t let them lie flat and give up. —DEThe third and most romantic installment in Rohrwacher’s informal trilogy exploring the relationship between Italy’s past and present, “La Chimera” finds the Tuscan filmmaker returning to the rustic charm and eternal regret of “The Wonders” and “Happy as Lazzaro” in order to stretch them across a richly textured canvas that spans from ancient Etruria to “The Crown.” It begins with a man played by Josh O’Connor (never better) as he dreams of the woman he loved and lost. His name is Arthur, her name was Beniamina, and there is no hope of them reuniting on this mortal coil. But Arthur isn’t one to give up. Legend tells of a buried door that connects this world to the next, and this surly archaeologist is so hellbent on finding it that he’s become the leader of a ragtag gang of tombarolis — lovable grave-robbers, essentially — in the small village where his Beniamina once lived. He offers the group his sorcerer-like ability to dowse the location of ancient treasures, and in return they do the digging for him. What he ultimately turns up is a lush and lived-in adventure that beats Indiana Jones at his own game while posing the question that Rohrwacher has been circling for so long: Does the past belong to everyone, or does it belong to no one? —DEFilmmaker Rodrigo Moreno’s pitch-black saga starts out as a familiar crime-gone-wrong story before it heads in a series of unexpected directions: It begins with a man who robs the bank where he works, with his intention of hiding the money until he’s released. In the process, he coerces a coworker into the scheme, and both men are forced to deal with the fallout as thrilling and comical twists unfold (including a most unexpected love triangle). By its third act, “The Delinquents” has the liberating air of a French New Wave movie, and folds in on itself to interrogate the very nature of its antiheroes’ quest until the journey becomes less relevant than the dream behind it. It takes guts to create such an entertaining genre experiment and then abandon it for something more profound and daring, but that’s exactly what makes “The Delinquents” such a bracing, unpredictable ride. —EKAn intimate three-hour epic of deliberate pacing, Vietnamese writer-director Thien An Pham’s Camera d’Or-winning debut feature is a spellbinding tale of the soul’s unfathomable desire for the other-worldly; a film that itself borders on transcendental in its grace and gradual blurring of apparent truth and suggested fantasy.“Inside the Yellow Cocoon Shell” premiered in the Directors’ Fortnight section, where the filmmaker was previously recipient of the Illy Prize in 2019 for the short “Stay Awake, Be Ready,” in which a roadside accident at a street corner interrupted a conversation between three friends having a meal. That short seems loosely remade for the new feature’s opening scene, which expands the idea to explore a man’s attempted overcoming of a deeply unsatisfied life, taking him from urban Saigon to the hinterland of Vietnam, out of both familial necessity and a quest to make sense of where and how to proceed with his life going forward. “The embrace of faith is ambiguous,” offers the film’s grief-stricken hero, “I want to believe, but I can’t. I’ve tried searching for it many times, but my mind always holds me back.”What follows is a metaphysical journey that steadily trains you in perceiving and eventually becoming lost in its sense of time, to the extent that you can almost forget the presence of the camera even when it is moving. Whether or not you’ve ever believed in a higher power, we’ve all questioned who we are, what we’re living for, and how to escape a certain mundanity in which modern society can box us. Based on the quality of his debut feature, Pham has certainly found his own divine calling with filmmaking. —JSWFinnish director Aki Kaurismäki has been making bittersweet deadpan comedies for decades without changing his formula one bit. That makes the precision of his latest example all the more satisfying as it presents a master of his own homegrown filmmaking style in full command of the medium. “Fallen Leaves” is not unlike Kaurismäki staples such as “Match Factory Girl” and “Ariel” in that it follows a lonely woman (Alma Poysti) who drifts through aimless jobs when she meets a heavy drinker (Jussi Vatanen) who seeks companionship of his own. Meanwhile, the specter of a larger broken world hangs over the plot as an essential contrast to put small dramas in the context they deserve. Together this couple can’t fix the world, but there’s still a transcendent beauty to the way they learn to navigate it together no matter the hardships in store. The meet-cute dynamic has such delicate precision to it that you almost feel as though Kaurismaki is whispering it in your ear, and he’s more than welcome there: “Fallen Leaves” is cinema as a warm blanket in a cold world. —EKMartin Scorsese may like to think of “Killers of the Flower Moon” as the Western that he always wanted to make, but this frequently spectacular American epic about the genocidal conspiracy that was visited upon the Osage Nation during the 1920s is more potent and self-possessed when it sticks a finger in one of the other genres that bubble up to the surface over the course of its three-and-a-half-hour runtime.The first and most obvious of those is a gangster drama in the grand tradition of the director’s previous work; just when it seemed like “The Irishman” might’ve been Scorsese’s final word on his signature genre, they’ve pulled him back in for another movie full of brutal killings, bitter voiceovers, and biting conclusions about the corruptive spirit of American capitalism. But if the “Reign of Terror” sometimes proves to be an uncomfortably vast backdrop for Scorsese’s  more intimate brand of crime saga, “Killers of the Flower Moon” excels as a compellingly multi-faceted character study about the men behind the massacre. Over time, it becomes the most interesting of the many different movies that comprise it: A twisted love story about the marriage between an Osage woman (the indomitable Lily Gladstone) and the white man who — unbeknownst to her — helped murder her entire family so that he could inherit the headrights for their oil fortune (Leonardo DiCaprio, giving the best performance of his career as the dumbest and most vile character he’s ever played). Finding the right balance in this story is a challenge for a filmmaker as gifted and operatic as Scorsese, whose ability to tell any story rubs up against his ultimate admission that this might not be his story to tell. And so, for better or worse, Scorsese turns “Killers of the Flower Moon” into the kind of story that he can still tell better than anyone else: A story about greed, corruption, and the mottled soul of a country that was born from the belief that it belonged to anyone callous enough to take it. —DEA heartbreakingly sincere piece of high camp that teases real human drama from the stuff of tabloid sensationalism, Todd Haynes’ delicious “May December” continues the director’s tradition of making films that rely upon the self-awareness that seems to elude their characters — especially the ones played by Julianne Moore. Here, the actress reteams with her “Safe” director to play Gracie Atherton-Yoo, a lispy former school teacher who became a household name back in 1992 when she left her ex-husband for one of her 13-year-old students. Now it’s 2015, the situation has normalized somewhat, and Gracie and Joe (a dad bod Charles Melton) have been together long enough that their youngest children are about to graduate high school. Their scandalous romance has settled into suburban reality… or so it would appear. Alas, the past isn’t quite ready to release its grip on these crazy kids just yet, especially once Gracie decides to roll out the welcome mat for a breathy TV actress who’s preparing to play her in an indie film about the scandal (Natalie Portman (phenomenally on pointe in a merciless performance). Inviting the stranger into her life seems innocent enough, but Gracie doesn’t quite understand what else she’s inviting into her life at the same time. Written by Samy Burch, “May December” is a catty-as-fuck dark comedy that deepens Haynes’ longstanding obsession with performance while poking fun at the kind of actresses he clearly loves so much. The director’s tonal playfulness has sometimes been overshadowed by the unerring consistency of his emotional textures, but here, in the funniest and least “stylized” of his films, it’s easier than ever to appreciate his genius for using artifice as a vehicle for truth. —DEThere is something to be said for a simple dish made with the best ingredients by a trusted hand. Just as a perfect omelet made by a lover is more satisfying than an eight-hour feast laid on by a Prince, so it follows that a film like “The Pot-au-Feu” works, not in spite of, but because it focuses on executing its basic premise with enrapturing attention to detail. This is a story about love and food, which it presents as the same thing.Sight unseen, it was always a mouth-watering prospect: two delicious French actors – Juliette Binoche as a cook and Benoît Magimel as her long-time lover and food-obsessed employer – feeding each other in Tran Anh Hung’s adaptation of a 2014 graphic novel reputed to be food porn. The promise of this set-up is delivered with gusto as the kitchen of a 19th century French manor house becomes the stage for the most elaborate foreplay you’ve ever seen. What “Call Me By Your Name” did for peaches “The Pot-au-Feu” does for syrup pears. Belonging to a fine tradition of intoxicating food films such as “Babette’s Feast”, “Julie & Julia”, and “Like Water For Chocolate,” “The Pot-au-Feau”  pushes the notion of bonding through vittles a step further. Certain dishes are so inscribed by their creators that they act as memory itself, says the film, a sentiment that leaves a beautiful after-taste. —SMKPablo Berger’s poignant animated feature, acquired by Neon out of Cannes, could very well enter the awards conversation this fall. The “Blancanieves” director’s first work with animation is a nearly wordless story of an anthropomorphized dog who acquires a robot buddy only to get it stuck on Coney Island, where the poor mechanical being gets stranded with low battery during the off-season. As the lonely canine attempts to rescue his companion and makes his way through an alienating pre-9/11 New York City, “Robot Dreams” strikes an astonishing happy medium between family-friendly entertainment and a powerful study of loneliness in the big city: It has a slapstick sense of play and storybook visuals, but its emotion cuts deep once said robot begins to dream. It’s been a while since a traditional 2D animated film managed such a tricky tonal balance (think vintage Pixar). “Robot Dreams” creeps up on you with a spell that lingers, and it’s a first-rate New York movie to boot. —EKIt’s Chile during the turn of the last century. A wealthy landowner who’s bought up most of Tierra del Fuego recruits the Scotsman who manages his security to exterminate the Indigenous Selk’nam people on his land. The Scot only wants one man to accompany him, a mixed-race mestizo of Indigenous descent who’s barely out of his teenage years, but the landowner insists that MacLennan also take along a wily Texan with a strong drawl and a big rep. So begins one of the most chilling art-Westerns to come along in some time, as provocative for its ideas, dialogue, and characterizations, as for the beauty of its empty landscapes. Felipe Galvez’s “The Settlers” may remind some viewers of a Budd Boetticher film when they’re watching it: following three men on horseback on a cross-country journey, it dramatizes questions of identity and belonging, and how these things can be written in violence. Most Boetticher-like, in a tight 98 minutes “The Settlers” says more than a lot of films double its length. It’s also a deeply felt work of activism with a message that needs to be heard in Chile. Just as nothing about the Pinochet coup in 1973 or the resulting dictatorship is taught in Chilean schools today, so is nothing about the genocide of the Selk’nam, a culture that is considered extinct, with only one living person today able to speak their language. This is a film that shows that, as easy as it is to forget about the past, it’s easier still when it was never taught in the first place. —CBHolocaust cinema has so implicitly existed in the shadow of a single question that it would no longer seem worth asking if not for the fact that it’s never been answered: How do you depict an atrocity? Is seeing necessary for believing, or are some things too unfathomable to adequately capture on camera? A Holocaust drama that’s defined by its rigorous compartmentalization and steadfast refusal to show any hint of explicit violence, Jonathan Glazer’s profoundly chilling “The Zone of Interest” stands out for how formally the film splits the difference between the two opposite modes of its solemn genre — a genre that may now be impossible to consider without it. No Holocaust movie has ever been more committed to illustrating the banality of evil, and that’s because no Holocaust movie has ever been more hell-bent upon ignoring evil altogether. There is a literal concrete wall that separates Glazer’s characters from the horrors next door (those characters being the commandant of Auschwitz and his family), and not once does his camera dare to peek over it for a better look.The authorless quality of Glazer’s images frees the characters within them from the emptiness of moral judgment. The evil on display is never the least bit in doubt, but its failure to recognize itself as such is only so able to take shape in the absence of its limiting obviousness. By the end, “The Zone of Interest” insists that all of history’s most abominable moments have been permitted by people who didn’t have to see them, and while the film’s ultimate staying power has yet to be determined, its vision of normality is — as Hannah Arendt once described that phenomenon — “more terrifying than all the atrocities put together.” —DE",

        "title": "‘The Little Mermaid’ Makeup Artist Responds to Criticism About Drag Influences: ‘Why Can’t I Do as Good a Job as a Queer Artist?’",
        "content": "Whenever Disney announces a new remake of a classic animated film, it gives grown-up fans an opportunity to revisit the property with a critical perspective they may have lacked as children. When it came to Rob Marshall’s new take on “The Little Mermaid,” much of that discourse revolved around the influence of drag culture on the original film. Many fans were quick to point out the fact that the character of Ursula was shaped by iconic 20th century drag queens like Divine — something Melissa McCarthy happily acknowledged when she signed on to play Ursula in the remake.“There’s a drag queen that lives in me,” McCarthy said. “I’m always right on the verge of going full-time with her… To keep the humor and the sadness and the edginess to Ursula is everything I want in a character — and frankly, everything I want in a drag queen.”When the film hit theaters this weekend, certain fans and influencers took to social media to question why the film didn’t take more steps to include the drag community in the character design process. Many felt that makeup designer Peter Smith King’s job should have been given to a queer artist. But in a new interview with Insider, King made it clear that he disagrees with those criticisms.“I find that very offensive,” King said. “Why can’t I do as good a job as a queer makeup artist? That’s ridiculous. That’s trying to claim it and that’s fine, if that’s what they wanna do. But don’t put people down because they’re not what they want it to be.”King also clarified that, while he is a fan of drag culture, he didn’t pull directly from any existing performers when designing the live-action Ursula.“We discussed everything. I mean, we both laughed about how much we love drag queens and drag makeup and stuff,” said King. “It wasn’t based on any drag acts at all.” While Marshall’s remake topped the box office this weekend, reviews have generally been critical of the film’s inability to establish its own aesthetic and recapture the magic of the original.“So, does it look real? Sometimes, sure, but that’s a strange worry for a story that is — again, again — about mythical sea creatures,” IndieWire’s Kate Erbland wrote in her review. “Disney’s obsession with turning some of its most beloved properties into live-action offerings simply for, what, the realism? the technology? the money? stumbles into both flashes of brilliance and moments of sheer nonsense (the latter was more of an issue with the studio’s recent ‘Lion King’ remake than in this Marshall joint). That trend will likely continue to be true for the foreseeable future, but until the House of Mouse cracks the real problem at hand, these films will never become classics on their own merit.”",

        "title": "Quentin Tarantino Says Cannes Added Violent Content Warnings Because of Him — and Removed Them for Lars von Trier",
        "content": "Quentin Tarantino made a trip to Cannes this week to promote a special screening of the grindhouse classic “Rolling Thunder” and present the Grand Prix at the festival’s award ceremony. He took the opportunity to reflect on his long history with the Cannes Film Festival, which helped elevate him into the stratosphere when he won the Palme d’Or for “Pulp Fiction” in 1994.Speaking to Deadline, Tarantino recalled the festival’s concerns about the violence in “Reservoir Dogs,” which screened out of competition at Cannes in 1992. He claims that the festival added an unprecedented content warning to both “Reservoir Dogs” and “Pulp Fiction” — then stopped using them when European filmmakers like Lars von Trier started matching Tarantino’s shock value.“They invented something for our screening that they’d never done before, they put an orange sticker in the ticket that said: This movie may be too violent for you to watch,” he said. “And they’d never done that before and they ended up putting the same sticker on ‘Pulp Fiction’ when it played here in 1994. And then at some point with Lars von Trier they stopped putting the sticker on.”It remains to be seen whether Tarantino’s upcoming final film, “The Movie Critic,” will be violent enough to require a warning. The director recently explained that the film will be a fictionalized story about a real film critic he used to read in a pornographic magazine when he worked at an adult movie theater.“All the other stuff was too skanky to read but then there was this porno rag that had a really interesting movie page,” Tarantino said. “He wrote about mainstream movies and he was the second-string critic. I think he was a very good critic. He was as cynical as hell. His reviews were a cross between early Howard Stern and what Travis Bickle might be if he were a film critic. Think about Travis’ diary entries.” He continued: “But the porno rag critic was very, very funny. He was very rude, you know. He cursed. He used racial slurs. But his shit was really funny. He was as rude as hell. He wrote like he was 55 but he was only in his early to mid-30s. He died in his late 30s. It wasn’t clear for a while but now I’ve done some more research and I think it was it was complications due to alcoholism.”",

        "title": "Priyanka Chopra Quit Bollywood Movie After Two Days Due to ‘Dehumanizing’ Treatment from Director",
        "content": "When Priyanka Chopra turned her Bollywood stardom into a series of high profile Hollywood roles including “The Matrix Resurrections” and Netflix’s “Citadel,” she became one of the biggest international stars in the world. But while her success is certainly a testament to her talent and the current moment that Indian cinema is having around the world, the actress has always been open about the dark side of Bollywood acting that ultimately prompted her to seek opportunities elsewhere. As she tells it, her decision to stop making movies in India was prompted by unfair pay and unpleasant conditions as much as bigger opportunities in America.In a new interview with The Zoe Report, Chopra recalled a particularly upsetting experience on an early film role that opened her eyes to some of the harsh realities about how the industry treats women.“This may have been 2002 or 2003” Chopra said. “I’m undercover, I’m seducing the guy – obviously that’s what girls do when they’re undercover. But I’m seducing the guy and you have to take off one piece of clothing [at a time]… I wanted to layer up [but] the filmmaker was like, ‘No, I need to see her underwear. Otherwise why is anybody coming to watch this movie?’”Chopra went on to explain that the experience was particularly jarring because the director didn’t even include her in the conversation about what she was doing on screen. He simply said it out loud to a crew member as if she wasn’t even there.“He didn’t say it to me,” Chopra added. “He said it to the stylist in front of me. It was such a dehumanising moment. It was a feeling of, ‘I’m nothing else outside of how I can be used, my art is not important, what I contribute is not important.’” The incident prompted Chopra to exit the project after just two days of shooting rather than continue to work with the director. She reimbursed the production for all of the money it had spent on her in order to make a clean break.“I just couldn’t look at [the director] every day,” she said.",

        "title": "Jon Favreau Says Robert Downey Jr. Was Originally Considered for a Different Marvel Role",
        "content": "Over the course of 15 years and 32 movies, Marvel Studios has gone from a Hollywood underdog to an unstoppable force. Kevin Feige and his team revolutionized franchise filmmaking with their Marvel Cinematic Universe concept, providing interlocking content that keeps the studio’s loyal fans satiated all year round. The studio has grown into an entertainment behemoth, but it all started with one risky movie: Jon Favreau‘s “Iron Man.”In a new conversation posted on Marvel’s official YouTube channel, Favreau and Feige celebrated the 15th anniversary of “Iron Man” by sitting down to discuss the film‘s legacy. Naturally, the conversation quickly turned to the topic of casting Robert Downey Jr.Much has been made of Marvel’s decision to gamble on Downey and give him a comeback role after years of publicly battling addiction. But Favreau revealed that the Marvel team had been looking to work with the actor long before the “Iron Man” role opened up. He explained that Feige and his team had already met with Downey about other roles — including an iconic villain.“I remember you had all met with him [Downey] already for like Doctor Doom or something on another project,” Favreau said. “I think he had come through on like maybe ‘Fantastic Four,’ so everybody sort of knew who he was.”Both men explained that once Downey had signed on to play Tony Stark, everything else about the movie seemed to fall into place.“Once it was him, that’s when my life got a lot easier because he understood the voice of the character,” Favreau said. “And then one by one, people were just signing on board because now it became something interesting.”Marvel’s reputation as a Hollywood juggernaut that’s too big to fail makes it easy to forget what a risky proposition the Marvel Cinematic Universe was at one point. Feige reminded fans that several of the studio’s earliest projects did not meet expectations. He credited Downey’s star power with keeping the brand alive during periods of uncertainty.“I remember on later movies – we’ll talk about them on the 15th anniversary of those – there were dark days,” the Marvel boss said. “I would say to Robert, ‘We wouldn’t be in this mess if it wasn’t for you,’ meaning we wouldn’t have a studio if it wasn’t for him. Or you [Favreau].”",

        "title": "‘Elemental’ Review: Pixar’s Latest Offers Mixed Immigrant Metaphors and a Genuine Romance",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Disney releases the film in theaters on Friday, June 16.So much of modern Pixar comes mired in “almost’s” and “what-if’s,” and Peter Sohn’s “Elemental” is no exception. It’s as conflicted as they come: a heavy-handed, mixed bag immigrant metaphor punctuated by a genuinely moving romance. It gets frequently lost down the rabbit-hole of its own conceptual details, but at the same time, it yields occasionally stunning images and thoughtful aesthetics — like Thomas Newman’s incredibly effective Indian-inspired score — resulting in a film that embodies the very best and worst of the studio’s recent output, defined more by its potential than whether or not it fulfills it.Sohn’s last directorial venture, “The Good Dinosaur,” was an unfortunate victim — along with “Soul” and “Toy Story 4” — of the strange Pixar era where environmental realism was the emerging lingua franca. This left cartoonish characters feeling awkward, and visually adrift. However, this time around, “Elemental” is set in Element City, a whole cloth creation that exists outside our reality, with its enormous cloud towers and water-splashing monorails, but one that’s meant to work as a metaphor for the modern United States.People made of water, trees, clouds, and flame — having immigrated in that order — make up the citizenry of this sprawling, storybook metropolis, but unlike the first three groups, its fire residents have not yet fully integrated or assimilated, owing to the rampant prejudice against them. Granted, this set up presents a bit of an X-Men problem (or, more vitally, a “Zootopia” problem, in which herbivores are prejudiced against carnivores) since the flame people do pose a legitimate danger, but hopefully the four-year-olds in the audience won’t mind. Our story begins with apprehensive migrant flame-couple Útrí dár ì Bùrdì (Ronnie del Carmen) and a pregnant Fâsh ì Síddèr (Shila Ommi) entering through the city’s version of Ellis Island, and being saddled with the simplified (see: Anglicized) names Bernie and Cinder Lumen by their immigration officer. Before long, they start their own convenience store, where they practically raise their daughter, Ember (Leah Lewis), in the hopes that one day she’ll inherit the family business.From the word go, the story of “Elemental” reflects the broad strokes of the American immigrant experience, but it begins to get muddled — slowly at first, and then rather quickly — when it tries to get specific. It pulls details from various real cultures to create its fire community, “the Firish,” born from a mix of minor traditions borrowed from various East Asian, Middle Eastern, and European cultures, and accents that seem to shift between Italian, Hispanic, Iranian, and West Indian at the drop of a hat. The idea may be for immigrant and first generation kids to be able to find some sort of recognition, but the result is del Carmen and Ommi playing an uncomfortable game of ethnic hopscotch with their vocal performances, with practically every line dedicated to some malformed pun unlikely to elicit even chuckle (in Element City, hot dogs are called hot logs, because they’re made of logs).This racial mishmash is a capital “B” Bad Idea with good intentions, but thankfully, the more personal elements of the story are often strong enough that these unsavory optics can be temporarily brushed aside. Lumen, apart from being rendered with some truly otherworldly animation — a 2D creature in a 3D world — is also the rare Pixar character defined by an uncomfortable cultural dilemma. Immigrant stories where first-gen kids feel torn between family and career, or the individual and the collective, are a dime a dozen at this point, but while a similar dynamic defines Lumen’s story, it’s the backdrop to something a little more intimate.Her relationship with her father is central; it’s sweet, if sometimes jagged, with the weight of expectation being as much a gift as it is a burden. In his broken English, he calls her his “good daughter,” and she lovingly refers to him as “ashfa” — the honorific for “father” in their language — but Lumen also struggles with a burning temper whose origins she fails to fully recognize, and which manifests as her red-and-yellow flame turning dangerously purple.The plot is kicked into motion when the store gets accidentally flooded in Bernie’s absence, and Lumen is left to deal city inspector Wade Ripple (Mamoudou Athie), a sheltered but empathetic and sensitive (to the point of sappy) water-person who decides to help her, if it means keeping her father’s business afloat. This results in a whole lot of half-baked plot being pumped into the movie within very little time — mostly involving a quest to discover a rather mundane leak — but thankfully, its flimsiness ends up a blessing in disguise, since this subplot easily shoved aside when it comes time to let Wade and Ember interact.While nearly every line plays like a missed shot at a double-entendre, the film bursts to life when no one is talking, thanks to some gorgeous, eye-popping visuals born from the mysterious way light interacts with both characters during montages, tipping the film into abstract territory. Hollywood couples comprising short-tempered women and sensitive men are in short supply to begin with, let alone when they take such interesting physical and vocal forms (Lewis’ straightforward, smoky delivery mixes amusingly well with Athie’s unrestrained bubbliness and his tendency to bawl).Once you get past the movie’s mal-formed mechanics — water people are made of water, but they aren’t water themselves; tree people, similarly, don’t seem to mind people eating “hot logs” — and if you’re ready to take the movie at its word, when it comes to water and fire being equally dangerous to one another, then its story is not entirely untoward. Wade and Ember are reluctant to touch for this reason, but the way they frolic through the city, and soften and strengthen one another, makes for Pixar’s first genuine romance since Carl and Ellie (albeit with slightly happier results than the opening scene of “Up”).Even when things don’t quite add up, and get lost in a pile of mixed metaphors, Thomas Newman’s score rushes in to uplift the entire film, with its use of classical Indian instruments like sitars, tabla drums, and bansuri flutes, and vocalizations in Indian raags that range from thrilling to soul-touching, especially when they’re peppered with the occasional subdued acoustic guitar or hint of electronica. “Elemental” may be rife with lip-service to cultural specifics — so many that they end up a cultural hodgepodge — but its music is the one aesthetic choice that fully embodies the bi-cultural notions the film so desperately attempts to dramatize.Despite its confused and overstuffed worldbuilding, “Elemental” has enough charming moments to get by, even if its meaning lies less in its ill-conceived immigrant saga, and more in the personal drama that lives a few layers beneath it. “Elemental” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Disney will release it in theaters on Friday, June 16.",

        "title": "‘Anatomy of a Fall’ Scores Fourth Palme d’Or for Neon as It Launches Into Awards Season",
        "content": "If there was an award for the savviest U.S. distributor at the Cannes Film Festival, it would have to go to Neon, which scored its fourth consecutive Palme d’Or at the conclusion of the 76th edition on Saturday. The top prize went to French director Justine Triet for “Anatomy of a Fall,” a murder mystery and courtroom drama starring Sandra Hüller that Neon acquired shortly after its festival premiere on Tuesday. In the two weeks leading up to the end of this year’s festival, critical consensus focused on “The Zone of Interest,” Jonathan Glazer’s austere riff on Martin Amis’ novel about the commander of Auschwitz. As a result, many assumed it would be an obvious choice for the Palme.But critics don’t pick that prize; the jury is composed of filmmakers and actors who tend to land on a consensus choice for the top prize while spreading the love in other categories (the Palme winner can’t be awarded any other prizes). “Zone” won the Grand Prix — essentially second-place — setting up the A24 project for a bright future beyond the festival. The German-language production could wind up as an international Oscar submission for the UK, while the impeccable craft of the movie could set it up for other major categories, including Best Director and Best Picture.  Still, many journalists seemed surprised that the one movie that generated the most noise over the course of two weeks didn’t get the biggest award. “It was not easy,” a coy Ostlund said at a jury press conference. “I think all of us had to really fight for what we believed was the right film and the competition was hard.” He added that the premiere of “Anatomy” was “an intense screening. It’s exactly what cinema should be about. I’m very excited to see that film come out in the world.”For now, then, the spotlight shines brightest on “Anatomy of a Fall” — and it’s in good company. Neon’s first Palme win came in 2020 with “Parasite,” which launched it into a long awards season that culminated with its historic Best Picture win. It was followed by 2021’s “Titane,” Julia Ducournau’s feminist body horror effort that became France’s official submission, and then last year’s Ruben Ostlund-directed satire “Triangle of Sadness,” which landed Oscar nominations for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay.  Will “Anatomy of a Fall” continue on a similar path?The directors of those last two winners took part in this year’s jury, with Ostlund serving as its president. The Swedish filmmaker said at the start of the festival that he would rather win a third Palme d’Or than an Oscar. However, as both of his Palme d’Or winners were also Oscar nominees (he was also nominated for his earlier Palme winner “The Square”), Ostlund understands the potential springboard effect of a Palme win — and so does Neon, which will now aim to position the movie for the year ahead with a few obvious categories. Hüller, who has been a Cannes favorite ever since her acclaimed turn in the 2016 comedy “Toni Erdmann,” also had a supporting role as the wife of the Auschwitz commander played by Christian Friedel. Many expected Hüller to take home a Best Actress prize in her most prominent year at the festival. She didn’t, but still got called back to the festival to join Triet onstage for the awards, and the UTA-repped actress stands a good chance of expanding her U.S. profile this year as the centerpiece of a largely English-language production. That also creates a curious challenge for “Anatomy” when it comes to Oscar potential. “Anatomy of a Fall” will prove to be a challenging theatrical proposition, but any audiences wary of so-called “foreign language” movies won’t be deterred. The movie finds Hüller playing a German novelist accused of murdering her husband at their snowy lodge. Her courtroom interrogation consumes a large portion of the story as it bathes in ambiguity, and she often uses English language to communicate because her character struggles in French.Oscar requirements for international submissions mandate that at least 51 percent of the dialogue must be in a language other than English, and English dominates several key scenes in the movie. However, sources tell IndieWire that sales agent mk2 make it clear in negotiations that the dialogue of “Anatomy” is predominantly French, and could qualify for the country’s Oscar submission if its committee were to select it later this year. It’s up to the Academy now to check the math on that. The Palme win for Triet marks only the third time the prize has gone to a woman after Ducournau’s own win in 2021, which followed Jane Campion’s prize for “The Piano” way back in 1993. With 33 percent of the Cannes selection directed by women and seven in competition, the odds were higher than ever before for another woman to take the prize. Onstage to present the announcement of the Palme d’Or this year, Jane Fonda put that progress in a historical context by recalling her first trip to the festival in the early 1960s. “There were no women directors competing at that time and it never even occurred to us that there was something wrong with that,” she said. “We’ve come a long way, and we have a long way to go, but still we have to celebrate change when it happens.”Nevertheless, it would be a fool’s errand to argue that the jury singled out Triet solely on the basis of her gender. “Anatomy of a Fall” is first-rate Hitchcockian storytelling with an audacious legal twist that keeps audiences guessing, and it follows Triet’s well-received dark comedy “Sybil” that played in competition in 2019. She has been on track to deliver a universally well-received Cannes hit for a while now. “This film is the most intimate one I’ve ever written, the one that’s closest to me,” she said in her Cannes speech. She added that she initially planned the project as a TV series until her producers talked her into making it as a feature. “I thought I would move on quickly, do something else,” she said. “I simply would like to say at this stage that I’m very pleased I’ve made a film.”Triet’s speech took a political turn when she noted the current protests over France’s decision to raise the retirement from 62 to 64. On top of that, she also expressed concern over the end to France’s “cultural exception” to art that reduces the value-added tax for creative endeavors. “The merchandization of culture defended by the French government is breaking the French cultural exception,” she said. “Without this cultural exception, I would not be here before you today. This award is dedicated to all those who cannot manage to shoot films today. I occupied this space 15 years ago in a less hostile world where it was still possible to make mistakes and start again.”The specificity of those remarks may or may not remain a part of Triet’s campaign as “Anatomy of a Fall” makes its way into the world. But whatever happens next, it seems likely that its profile will keep expanding after Cannes. As the ceremony host Chiara Mastroianni said at the start of the show: “It’s the closing night, but it’s not finished. Spectators will now step in and spread the word about the films here.”Check out the full list of awards winners here.",

        "title": "Jane Fonda on Jean-Luc Godard: ‘A Great Filmmaker. But as a Man? I’m Sorry, No.’",
        "content": "Jane Fonda was in Cannes this week to present the Palme d’Or to Justine Triet for her acclaimed film “Anatomy of a Fall.” And she used her time on the Croisette to share her unfiltered thoughts on some of the industry’s most influential figures. Appearing at the festival on Friday, Fonda made no attempts to hide her feelings about the likes of Jean-Luc Godard and Robert Redford (via Deadline).“He was a great filmmaker,” Fonda said of Godard. “I take my hat off. A great filmmaker. But as a man? I’m sorry. No, no.”The Oscar winner did not elaborate on her issues with the “Breathless” director, but she got more specific when it came to her thoughts on Redford. Fonda recalled working with Redford on four films beginning with 1967’s “Barefoot in the Park.” She said that she “was in love” with the famously handsome actor when she first met him, but came to realize that he “just has an issue with women.” By the time they worked together on the 2017 film “Our Souls at Night,” Fonda said she had learned how to deal with him.“He’s always in a bad mood, and I always thought it was my fault,” she said of working with Redford. “The last movie I made with him was six years ago. What was I, about 80 years old or something like that. And I finally knew I had grown up. When he would come on the set three hours late in a bad mood, I knew it wasn’t my fault.”Fonda’s comments about Godard are not the first time the actress has aired her grievances with dead French filmmakers. She recently recalled being inappropriately propositioned by René Clément during the production of the 1964 film “Joy House.” Fonda claims that the director attempted to sleep with her under the guise of acting preparation, but she was able to decline by pretending not to speak French.“Well, he wanted to go to bed with me because he said the character had to have an orgasm in the movie and he needed to see what my orgasms were like,” she said. “He said it in French and I pretended I didn’t understand.”",

        "content": "After a star-studded festival that saw everyone from Martin Scorsese to Harrison Ford walking the Croisette, the 76th Cannes Film Festival is finally drawing to a close. This year’s lineup was heavy on big names, with the likes of Wes Anderson, Todd Haynes, Jonathan Glazer, Wim Wenders, and Hirokazu Kore-eda all debuting new works in competition. Once all the major films screened, it was up to the jury to award the festival’s most coveted honors.Ruben Östlund — who has two Palme d’Or wins to his name for “The Square” and “Triangle of Sadness” — presided over this year’s jury. He was joined by a group of nine jurors that includes Paul Dano, Brie Larson, and “Titane” director Julie Ducournau. Östlund recently spoke to IndieWire about his approach to the deliberation process and his determination to avoid leaks to the media.“This will be the first jury in the history of the Cannes Film Festival where the publicists will have no rumors to tell to each other,” Östlund said. “If someone comes up to us and asks us what we thought about a film, we won’t [say].”Coming into the ceremony, many Cannes observers had Justine Triet’s “Anatomy of a Fall” and Jonathan Glazer’s “The Zone of Interest” pegged as the leading contenders for the top awards. That consensus ended up being correct, as “Anatomy of a Fall” won the Palme d’Or and “The Zone of Interest” took home the Grand Prix. Triet became the third woman to win a Palme d’Or, following in the footsteps of Ducournau (“Titane”) and Jane Campion (“The Piano”). Koji Yakusho won Best Actor for his performance in Wim Wenders’ “Perfect Days,’ while “About Dry Grasses” star Merve Dizdar won Best Actress.For the first time, this year’s ceremony was live-streamed for viewers around the world.

        "title": "Quentin Tarantino Has No Time for Ryan Reynolds’ Netflix Blockbusters: ‘Those Movies Don’t Exist in the Zeitgeist’",
        "content": "Quentin Tarantino‘s upcoming 10th film “The Movie Critic” is going to be a bittersweet event for cinephiles. A new Tarantino movie is always cause to celebrate, but the project will be his last feature film before his long-planned retirement. While Tarantino has remained open to working in other mediums like television and theatre, he appears more confident than ever that he’s walking away from movies at the right time.Speaking to Deadline at the Cannes Film Festival, Tarantino explained that the erosion of theatrical releases for new movies has solidified his belief that it’s time to retire.“It’s just time to go out. I like the idea of going out on top,” Tarantino said. “I like the idea of giving it my all for 30 years and then saying, ‘OK, that’s enough.’ And I don’t like working to diminishing returns. And I mean, now is a good time because I mean, what even is a motion picture anyway anymore? Is it just something that they show on Apple? That would be diminishing returns.”Tarantino teased that “The Movie Critic” will likely be made at Sony (who also partnered with Tarantino on “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood”) due to his appreciation for the studio’s commitment to theatrical releases.“I’m probably going to be doing the movie with Sony because they’re the last game in town that is just absolutely, utterly, committed to the theatrical experience,” he said. “It’s not about feeding their streaming network. They are committed to theatrical experience. They judge success by asses on seats. And they judge success by the movies entering the zeitgeist, not just making a big expensive movie and then putting it on your streaming platform. No one even knows it’s there.”Tarantino offered a more specific example of this phenomenon, calling out Netflix for making expensive blockbusters such as the Ryan Reynolds vehicles “Red Notice” and “The Adam Project” that made no real cultural impact after being unceremoniously released on the streaming service.“I mean, and I’m not picking on anybody, but apparently for Netflix, Ryan Reynolds has made $50 million on this movie and $50 million on that movie and $50 million on the next movie for them,” he said. “I don’t know what any of those movies are. I’ve never seen them. Have you? I haven’t ever talked to Ryan Reynolds’ agent, but his agent is like, ‘Well, it cost $50 million.’ Well, good for him that he’s making so much money. But those movies don’t exist in the zeitgeist. It’s almost like they don’t even exist.”",

        "title": "‘Wild Life’ Continues Filmmaking Duo’s Non-Fiction Winning Streak",
        "content": "With “Wild Life,” the filmmaking team of Jimmy Chin and Chai Vasarhelyi prove yet again — after “Meru,” Oscar-winning “Free Solo,” and “The Rescue” — that they are nonpareils at delivering consistently stunning visuals and provocative non-fiction content. Unlike most documentary filmmakers these days, they had a juicy NatGeo budget to film in the wildest areas of Chile and Argentina and the opportunity to screen their movie theatrically via Picturehouse before winding up on Disney+ May 26.The directing duo choose their subjects carefully. In this case, at the center of this dramatic decades-spanning story is Kristine McDivitt Tompkins who, having risen to CEO of Patagonia after 23 years at the company, abruptly left to marry billionaire eco-philanthropist Doug Tompkins and join his mission to save millions of acres of wildlands in Chile and Argentina. In 2015, after he died in a kayak accident, she took on his mission and in 2018 donated 10 million acres as national parkland.Chin had climbed with Doug Tompkins, who founded North Face and Esprit, and Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard and his VP Rick Ridgeway, and considered them close friends. On a 2002 Tibetan plateau trek, Ridgeway first taught Chin how to film his climbs and introduced him to Chouinard and then the Tompkins a few years later. For years, Vasarhelyi was wary of jumping into a documentary about Chin and his powerful friends — who were accustomed to controlling their world. But their story was too strong to ignore.“You’re damned if you do, damned if you don’t, if you try making a movie about your husband and life partner and filmmaking partner’s mentors,” Vasarhelyi told me at an Academy Q & A. “I only seem to lose. Either he’s gonna be mad or everyone’s going to be mad. But there was something about the story, we were flirting with it for quite a long time. Jimmy was compelled because these are the people who mean the most to him in the world. And when I understood this idea of second chances and regeneration, this idea that Doug Tompkins at the height of his Esprit days had decided there was more he could do for the world; he was willing to walk away from family, from wife, from a company, to try to do more and move to Patagonia, and Kris Tompkins, this was her family she was leaving, but she felt like she could do more. And then the worst thing that will happen, the love of your life who you found later in life, dies. And you have this audacious dream, of trying to create the largest private land donation in history and take on incredibly conservative governments, doing all the sweat work of converting their communities. I was inspired by this idea of a woman using her voice.”There were parallels that couldn’t be denied between two couples who are not just married but incredibly intensely involved in their work. “It’s the fighting like cats in a bag club,” said Tompkins at the Q & A. “However, at night, every night, you have to turn to one another and say, ‘I love and adore you.’ I see that in these guys. Yvon always said that Japanese swords are made of this incredible steel that they work over and over and over again. That is the nature of marriage to me and living these extreme lives. And that’s what we wanted. And that’s what we got.”Of course Chin started off eight years ago by filming his friends on a vertiginous mountainside. “That was part of the impetus of the film, that Kris had invited myself and Rick Ridgeway to come down and climb Cerro Torre there. And so we had set that time to do that. Right when we’re about to come down to do the climb, [Chilean] President Bachelet was coming to meet with Kris for the first time, and talk seriously about the parks. And I asked Kris if anybody was filming it. And she said, ‘no,’ because she wasn’t thinking so much about films or making a big deal out of it. So we came down and filmed on that trip.”Kris Tompkins wasn’t sure she wanted to participate in the movie until “Free Solo” star Alex Honnold gave her a push. “Look, I understand that Jimmy and Chai want to do this film about you guys,” he said.“I’m jumping foot to foot,” she said. “I’m not sure.”“Do what I did: sign the contract, and then forget about it.”And that’s what she did. When she saw the film sitting with the audience at the 2023 SXSW premiere, she was happy. “I love the story,” she said, “and these two have allowed me to fall in love with this story in a way that I can sit back and just be grateful that ‘God,’ as I say at the end of the film, ‘what a life!'” And if Doug were here, he would agree with me that the last 30 years, we’re very proud of it. But a legacy for us would be what’s happening from today forward. We have the second generation of Tompkins Conservation, and some of the third generation out here. And I hope our legacy is something you see 50 to 100 years out there. The back. That’s done.”Up next: Chin and Vasarhelyi are finishing up their first fiction film, “Nyad” (fall, Netflix) based on the true story of swimmer Diana Nyad, who tried to swim from Cuba to Florida four times, starting when she was 28. “It’s very true to brand, about someone who can’t give up ever,” said Vasarhelyi. “Finally she did it on the fifth try when she was 64.”“She had a 30-year, incredibly, retirement from swimming,” said Chin.“But she had a vibrant broadcasting career,” said Vasarhelyi. “Annette Bening was 64 when she played the part and she trained for a year. And then Jodie Foster was 60. And it’s Jodie’s first role as an openly gay woman.”The transition from documentary filmmaking, where you’re looking at what’s in front of you, to fiction, where you’re creating what’s in front of you, wasn’t as tough as they expected. Working with the actors was easier, Chin said, than “trying to get Alex [Honnold] to do things he didn’t want to do. Those instincts of filmmaking and story and emotion and the subtext of what each scene is about? Those were all instincts that were pretty well honed. But the challenge was the number of questions you have to answer in a given day.”They’re not giving up on documentaries just yet.",

        "title": "‘The Old Oak’ Review: Ken Loach’s Swan Song Is a Contrived Morality Play about Syrian Refugees",
        "content": "Editor’s Note: This review originally published during the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. “The Old Oak” will be released in U.S. theaters on April 5, 2024.Three-dimensional characterization is a casualty of Ken Loach’s ongoing social justice project. Yet the 86-year-old idealogue’s tireless stocktaking of the human toll exacted by a Conservative British government –  in power since 2010 – has been of political consequence. His 2016 Palme d’Or winner “I, Daniel Blake”, about the crushing UK benefits system, had its title projected onto the Houses of Parliament and became a rallying shorthand amongst campaigners for reform.According to Loach, “The Old Oak” will be his last film. And given that his brand of morality plays have filled a void in terms of a genuinely revolutionary cinema, it feels precious to take umbrage at something as cosmetic as a lack of artistry. Indeed, my disenchanted reaction to “The Old Oak” and its sincere account of solidarity against the forces of anti-refugee racism, made me question whether taste matters during times of political desperation. If “The Old Oak” can be leveraged as a font of humanity in an era in which our Prime Minister and his ghoulish Home Secretary proudly parade the slogan ‘Stop The Boats’ does it really matter if its tendency to use characters exclusively as mouthpieces is dramatically tedious?Set in a small, left-behind ex-mining town in the north of England, “The Old Oak” trades in broad-strokes sentimentality and diligent consciousness-raising. The year is 2016 and Syrian refugees are being housed in this enclave of County Durham. While some locals respond to their arrival with a barrage of racist taunts, others, like Tommy Joe Ballantyne (Dave Turner), landlord of a pub that is clinging on for dear life, take it upon themselves to offer a warmer welcome. TJ steps in when a young Syrian photographer Yara (Ebla Mari ) has her camera smashed by a yob in a Newcastle United football shirt. Their friendship becomes the nucleus of a cultural exchange that slowly fans out to include more of the townspeople. The antagonists of the piece are a Greek chorus of racist oafs — TJ’s regulars and the lifeblood of his pub. The most fallen of these men is TJ’s oldest friend Charlie, a man who in his bitterness has turned to scapegoating refugees. In one early scene, Charlie and his cronies give voice to the damage caused by housing developers who have bought up neighboring properties at a low price, driving down the value of their homes and trapping them there indefinitely. Loach wants to establish that these people have legitimate grievances, but have committed to the vile error of punching down instead of punching up. The film flirts with nuance when it shows local kids watching with envy as a young Syrian girl is gifted a second-hand bicycle. Much as in America’s Rust Belt states, there are a generation of working-class white people with vanishingly few prospects. However, Loach is not interested in delving into a complex stew of class and racial tensions, for his antagonists are presented as pantomime villains, with dialogue transcribed from a playbook of racist cliches. There is much mumbling, muttering, aggressive pint swigging, and dramatic ultimatums issued as The Old Oak pub becomes the center of a turf war.Yara proves to be a heartfelt community activist, awakening in TJ long dormant urges to match her efforts. Loach’s regular screenwriter, Paul Laverty, writes some reluctance into this personal growth, contriving a clunky backstory that serves to load a metric tonne of significance onto his pet pooch, Marra. Given that larger, more dangerous dogs roam the neighborhood, one instantly fears for this tiny terrier.As the narrative plods on, the lack of subtext or texture or psychological complexity in the dialogue begins to grate. First time actor Mari brings heartfelt vivacity to Yara, making her a plausible driving force for social integration. Nonetheless, she is saddled with lines that are pure exposition, like, “My children will never see Palmyra Temple, built by the Romans and destroyed by the Islamic State in 2015.” Loach made a formidable documentary “The Spirit of ‘45” (2013) about the hopeful post-war years that gave birth to the NHS and the heartbreak that has followed its stealth dismantling by a profit-hungry government. Documentary is a logical form for rhetorical filmmaking. Perhaps his recent trilogy “(I, Daniel Blake”, “Sorry We Missed You” and now “The Old Oak”) are documentaries masquerading as fiction, for supplying facts is given far greater weight than character or story. Another factual lesson shoehorned into the mix is that of the 1984 Miners Strike. This year of proud working-class resistance is enshrined by TJ in a cluttered backroom of The Old Oak with walls decorated by black and white photographs of the strikers and their supporters. One of these photos has a caption that inspires Yara to organize free meals so that Syrian refugees and the poor locals can all come together to break bread and build bonds. She asks TJ if they can use the backroom of The Old Oak for this event, setting in motion a subplot revolving around the viability of repairing the plumbing and electricity. Credit to Ken, he does not glamourise event planning.There are a handful of standout scenes, such as when Yara puts together a slideshow of the photos she has taken of the townspeople. The predominantly non-professional cast respond with touching wonder at their image seen through an artist’s eyes. Although a lot of the film feels like a breathless box-ticking exercise designed to Include Every Pertinent Fact, the chemistry between Turner and Mari leads to a relationship rarely seen in cinema: a platonic friendship between an older man and a younger woman born of mutual respect. The mighty oak that is Ken Loach may be retiring, but here’s hoping he’s scattered some acorns.“The Old Oak” premiered in competition at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.",

        "title": "Hollywood’s Fuzzy Math: Lionsgate the Company Is Worth $4.8 Billion, but the Parts Are Worth $8.7 Billion",
        "content": "The free market operates on the principle that a good or service is worth as much as somebody will pay for it, and Lionsgate is banking on it. Analysts note that while Lionsgate-the-company is worth about $4.8 billion, the sum of its parts — Lionsgate-the-library-tv-studio-and-Starz — are worth $8.7 billion. How does that work?To illustrate that disparity, meet the Rosenblatt Securities analyst Barton Crockett. He wrote in a Friday morning note to clients (obtained by IndieWire) that Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation as-is is worth $4.8 billion (enterprise value = market cap + debt + cash), or about half an MGM.However, Crockett believes Lionsgate’s library alone, which includes “La La Land” and the “John Wick,” “Hunger Games,” and “Twilight” franchises, has a net value of $5.525 billion. In other words, to Wall Street, the archives are worth more than the whole company as it’s currently structured. TV production is worth another $1.6 billion, Crockett wrote, as is the entire Starz business.After a strong Friday rally of nearly 14 percent, shares in Lionsgate Entertainment Corporation (LGF) closed at $11.57 — what the company’s studio is worth on its own, the equity analysts at Wells Fargo believe. The other half of Lionsgate, Starz, is worth just $1-$2 per share, Steven Cahall and his team wrote in a Thursday-night note to clients. (Crockett’s sum-of-the-parts valuation puts LGF at a $24-per-share price target; as-is, Rosenblatt sees a $16 future.)All Lionsgate execs could talk about on Thursday’s conference call was the library, which generated record annual revenue of $884 million. The senior-management team even took the time the library acquisitions of Quentin Tarantino’s “Kill Bill Vol. 1, “Kill Bill Vol. 2,” and “Jackie Brown.”By comparison, Starz is a seen by the market as an also-ran. The “Outlander” and “Power” home has been hit hard with cord-cutting, and now faces a rocky streaming ecosystem cluttered with bigger players scaling back.An analyst on Thursday’s earnings call asked if the trend would ding the future value of Lionsgate’s library business. Executives argued that not only are there still plenty of buyers in AVOD (ad-supported video on-demand) and FAST (free, ad-supported streaming television), Lionsgate’s shelves also have enough hits to still thrive. (But, that’s also the job of a Lionsgate executive.)Just don’t go looking for MGM money, Cahall cautioned; beyond the draw of its “Bond,” “Rocky,” and “Creed” franchises, the M&A market “has likely cooled” since then, he wrote.Geez, Steve, it’s the Friday afternoon before Memorial Day weekend — can we end on a positive note?Cahall still thinks “there will be numerous parties interested” in Lionsgate’s studio. After all, it is “among the best setups in media,” he continued, making it “a likely consolidation target by larger media players.” Put another way: Who wants to stick it to Amazon? You up for it, Apple?Additional reporting by Brian Welk.",

        "title": "How to Stream the 2023 Cannes Film Awards Ceremony",
        "content": "As quickly as it began, another Cannes Film Festival is wrapping up. This year’s festival featured one of the most stacked Cannes lineups in years, with new films from the likes of Martin Scorsese, Wes Anderson, Todd Haynes, Jonathan Glazer, and Wim Wenders premiering alongside more popular fare like “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” and the first two episodes of HBO’s controversial new series “The Idol.”With all the biggest premieres firmly in the rearview mirror other than Disney/Pixar’s out-of-competition “Elemental,” the time has almost come for the jury to hand out the festival’s awards — including the coveted Palme d’Or. Ruben Östlund, hot off his second Palme d’Or win for 2022’s “Triangle of Sadness” after winning for 2017’s “The Square,” served as this year’s jury president, overseeing a director-heavy jury that also includes “Titane” filmmaker Julie Ducournau along with Paul Dano and Brie Larson.Cannes awards are famously unpredictable, so it’s anyone’s guess as to which films they’ll ultimately choose to honor. Many early predictions have Glazer’s “The Zone of Interest,” Justine Triet’s “Anatomy of a Fall,” and Aki Kaurismaki’s “Fallen Leaves” as current frontrunners. But the late-breaking round of positive reviews for Wenders’ Tokyo-set drama “Perfect Days” could also make it a formidable contender — the 77-year-old director is a Cannes legend and his latest work is his best-reviewed film in years. The Wenders film is also being acquired by Neon, a Palme d’Or soothsayer after the distributor nabbed the top prize for “Triangle of Sadness,” “Titane,” and “Parasite” in recent years. Neon also has “Anatomy of a Fall” and Alice Rohrwacher’s “La Chimera” for North American distribution out of the Cannes competition.Many have also hailed Anderson’s “Asteroid City” as a return to form for the idiosyncratic director after mixed reactions to “Isle of Dogs” and “The French Dispatch,” so there may be an opportunity for the indie film rock star to pick up his first major Cannes award.Normally, the action at the Cannes awards ceremony is only visible to the people in the room. But this year, the ceremony is set to be live-streamed around the world for free. Anyone interested in watching the show can tune into the Brut America Facebook page when the ceremony begins at 2:30 p.m. ET/11:30 a.m. PT on Saturday, May 26, or 8:30 p.m. local time in France. Red carpet and press conference coverage will also be available on the official Cannes Film Festival YouTube channel.

        "content": "Keanu Reeves and Sofia Coppola are returning to their respective career roots.Twenty years after Coppola directed her breakout 2003 film “Lost in Translation” in Tokyo, the filmmaker returns to Japan with a short film for the Suntory Whisky Anniversary Tribute. Suntory Whiskey has become cinematically synonymous with “Lost in Translation” for Bill Murray’s quip, “For relaxing times, make it Suntory Time,” as his character is a fading-out actor sent to Tokyo to hawk the brand.Actor Reeves, who previously starred in a 1990s Suntory ad, leads the commercial, a montage that celebrates 100 years of the iconic liquor brand The House of Suntory.The ad shows Reeves walking through nightlife in Japan before ducking into a nondescript bar and ordering a glass of Suntory on the rocks as a vinyl record plays. The ad is set to Joan Jett and the Blackhearts’ cover of “Crimson and Clover.”“It was cool [to get] a chance to work with Sofia Coppola and to work with [her brother] Roman Coppola on a kind of short commercial and then a docu-series,” Reeves told People magazine of the project. “It was a really special opportunity.”Reeves and Sofia Coppola briefly dated after meeting during the making of “Bram Stoker’s Dracula,” which her father Francis Ford Coppola directed in 1992.The “John Wick: Chapter 4” actor added, “It was wonderful, really wonderful. It was extraordinary to have the opportunity to spend time with people from Suntory, in terms of going to the founding distillery Yamazaki, then going and just meeting master blenders and all the craftspeople. I got to meet some of the artisans, Kabuki actors, calligraphists, being an outsider and getting to spend time with people and talk about their passion and their craft.”Up next from Coppola is the Priscilla and Elvis Presley biopic “Priscilla” starring Cailee Spaeney and Jacob Elordi. Meanwhile, Reeves is attached to Jonah Hill’s Apple Original film “Outcome” which follows a damaged Hollywood actor who must dive into the dark depths of his past to confront his demons and make amends after he is extorted with a mysterious video clip resurfaces. Reeves is additionally set to star in Aziz Ansari’s “Good Fortune” alongside Seth Rogen; however, production has been halted due to the ongoing WGA strike.",

        "title": "How Alvin Ailey Dancers Helped Create a Live-Action ‘Under the Sea’ for ‘The Little Mermaid’",
        "content": "Director Rob Marshall knew from the outset that the hardest part of his live-action reimagining of Disney‘s “The Little Mermaid” would be pulling off the Oscar-winning “Under the Sea” Caribbean musical number. It wasn’t just the tricky translation from 2D to CG with hundreds of singing photoreal fish in the underwater environment (courtesy of Framestore’s expert animation) but also the complicated dance choreography set to the toe-tapping song by Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman (to whom the film is dedicated).And they killed it: The joyous musical number is the animated highlight of the film, which deservedly got the loudest applause at early screenings.Performed by Sebastian the crab (voiced by Daveed Diggs), the song is a plea for young mermaid Ariel (Halle Bailey) to forget about joining Prince Eric (Jonah Hauer-King) in the human world and stay sea-bound where she belongs. Considering the beauty, wonder, and fun, he makes a convincing musical argument.The first decision, though, was figuring out the animated design of the sea creatures, particularly Ariel’s sidekicks — Sebastian, Flounder the angelfish (voiced by Jacob Tremblay), and Scuttle the seagull (voiced by Awkwafina). Marshall definitely wanted a photoreal look with “The Blue Planet” as his model. This meant careful redesigns that fit the live-action world of the film.“I really wanted you to be engaged and believe that these [characters] are real ’cause you’re following their story,” Marshall told IndieWire. “Obviously, fish are talking and crowds are singing, but we based all those characters on a real crab, real fish, and real birds. We can’t use an animated fish to play Flounder because we’re creating a real world. In our version, too, we decided to make Scuttle a diving bird. We never wanted Ariel to ever, ever cross the surface because we wanted to raise the stakes of that moment instead of going up and down and up and down like she does in the animated film. It was something that was forbidden for her and a rule she only breaks after she sings ‘Part of Your World.’ That, to me, made it much more exciting storytelling.”But when it came to planning “Under the Sea,” Marshall didn’t know how to begin. “We were daunted by it because we have one live actor in this massive production number,” Marshall said. “And I remembered that Walt Disney had worked with the Ballet Russes when he was creating ‘Fantasia’ [for ‘The Nutcracker’ suite], so his artists would have some forms to work with, some dancers to work with. So we brought the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater over to London to work with our VFX artists. And we had this beautiful company of dancers literally replicate how [each sea creature] moved so that we could use that as templates for our artists to create this massive production.”Marshall tapped choreographer Joey Pizzi and co-choreographer Tara Nicole Hughes with creating the movements for the sea creatures. And they literally auditioned particular types of sea creatures whose bodies lent themselves to dance naturally. These included jellyfish, sea turtles, ribbon eels, flatworms, lipids, and a mimic octopus. “We had this plethora of choices,” Marshall continued. “There’s already a ballet happening under the sea anyway. When you watch ‘Blue Planet,’ it’s like, wow, it’s all there. So it was exciting to pick and choose which ones to work from.”All of the underwater scenes were shot “dry for wet” with blue screen and VFX enhancement. “If you were in the room when we were creating that, you’d have one girl sitting there while this is all spinning around her,” Marshall said. “We’re saying, this will be over here and this will be over there, and we had puppeteers. We’ve done a few production numbers in our lifetime, and this is the most challenging for sure.”",

        "title": "Why Can’t Documentaries Get Respect at Cannes?",
        "content": "Every year, the Cannes Film Festival program yields its riches. And every year, documentaries are kept to the selection sidebars, with the exception of just three over the years, two of which won the Palme d’Or: “The Silent World,” co-directed by Jacques Cousteau and Louis Malle in 1956, and Michael Moore’s “Fahrenheit 9/11” in 2004.This year, out of 16 documentaries in the Official Selection, two are in the Competition, the first time nonfiction titles have joined that storied roster since Moore’s inclusion.This is progress, but a quick glance at the latest Palme d’Or predictions reveals that Wang Bing’s “Youth” (marking the first 3.5-hours of an eventual 10-hour triptych) and “Olfa’s Daughters” from Kaouther Ben Hania are not high on the list of likely winners. Both are recognized by critics as boundary-pushing examples of the form but seem unlikely to become consensus award picks from Ruben Östlund’s eclectic Competition jury.What took the selection committee, which has been headed by festival director Thierry Fremaux since 2007, so long? One theory is that the Cannes brass weren’t thrilled when “Fahrenheit 9/11” popped out of the lineup of 18 contenders and walked off with the festival’s biggest prize. It’s more likely, that over the years, it was challenging for Fremaux to take away a Competition slot from a top auteur or French filmmaker in favor of a documentary.It was more convenient to book starry entries like Brett Morgen’s “Moonage Daydream,” Kevin Macdonald’s “Whitney,” and Asif Kapadia’s “Amy” and “Maradona” as midnight movie events or program them in sidebars like Un Certain Regard (Wang Bing’s second Cannes 2023 film, “Man in Black,” and Morocco’s Un Certain Regard directing prize winner “Mother of All Lies”) or as Special Screenings (Steve McQueen’s four-and-a-half hour “Occupied City” and Wim Wenders’ 3D “Anselm”) or even Cannes Classics (“Anita”). This year, the Quinzaine (Directors’ Fortnight) and Critics’ Week have no docs at all.Over the years, well-reviewed docs such as Charles Ferguson’s “Inside Job” and Errol Morris’ “Fog of War” world-premiered at Cannes outside of the Competition and still managed to score Oscar wins. “We’ve had such a great experience with docs at Cannes,” said Sony Pictures Classics co-president Michael Barker, who didn’t ask for Competition slots for the films. “There are so few docs, is it the right home for it? I always prefer that it has its own space.”One veteran documentary programmer for the Toronto International Film Festival and DOC NYC, Thom Powers, served on the Cannes doc jury that gave Agnès Varda and JR’s “Faces, Places” their top award, L’Œil d’Or. The movie wound up an Oscar nominee for Best Documentary Feature.“It still puzzles me that ‘Faces, Places’ did not play in Competition in 2017,” Powers said over the phone. “It seemed bizarre that an auteur of her stature did not play the main Competition when so many people of her generation seemed to show up in Competition with much lesser work.”Alas, the L’Œil d’Or is not an award to which people pay much attention.Last year, documentaries made a lot of noise when two took home the Golden Bear and Lion at Berlin and Venice, respectively: Nicolas Philibert’s mental health exposé “On the Adamant,” and Laura Poitras’ portrait of activist artist Nan Goldin, “All the Beauty and the Bloodshed,” which proceeded to an eventual Oscar nomination.Another Oscar nominee, “All That Breathes” (HBO), played at Cannes — out of competition as a Cannes Special Screening. “It’s indecipherable,” said seller Josh Braun of Submarine Entertainment, who hopes that the Berlin and Venice doc winners will make a difference in how documentaries are perceived by festival programmers. “It feels like institutional resistance might be broken down,” he said, “giving docs the promise they deserve. Cannes is hard to understand.”",

        "title": "‘The Machine’ Review: Bert Kreischer Takes His Shirtless Standup Schtick to Russia",
        "content": "“The Machine” begins with Bert Kreischer — playing a fictional version of himself — telling his therapist that he’s struggling to cut back on calling his teenage daughter a cunt. Yes, he knows he should find a nicer nickname for her and his wife of 20 years. But in his elegantly chosen words, sometimes they just act like one. The globetrotting journey that follows — in which Kreischer travels to Russia and back in order to learn that his eldest child and his partner who gave birth to her might not be cunts — is bound to tug at the heartstrings of even the most stoic fathers. Another win for feminism.Kreischer is well aware that he’s built a career out of making a complete ass of himself. (The fact that he owes his fortune to his willingness to publicly take his shirt off is a frequent conversation topic in “The Machine.”) So it shouldn’t surprise anyone but the most naive optimists that the film — which is based on his most famous stand-up bit — opts to give his audience what it wants by simply doubling down on the crassness. The comic’s preexisting fans should find plenty to love — it’s bound to be the cinematic event of the year for guys who base their entire personality around yelling “let’s gooooooo!” But anyone who goes in hoping for any kind of literary substance would be better off just reading the nutrition facts on their Junior Mints box.Though Kreischer has been in the public eye for 25 years, his career exploded in 2015 when he went viral for telling Joe Rogan a story about a school-sponsored trip to Russia that he took in college. As he recalled it, Kreischer led a group of Russian gangsters in a spirited night of drinking that led to him being forced to rob a train and steal a pocket watch. He tried to tell his new friends that he was a badass, but his loose grasp on the Russian language led to him inadvertently giving himself the nickname “The Machine” instead.The movie “The Machine” picks up a few years after that famed podcast hit, with the fictional Kreischer enjoying a lavish lifestyle thanks to the fame that the story brought him. But he decided to step away from the stage after realizing the toll that his hard-partying persona was taking on his family. The final straw came when he asked his 15-year-old daughter Sasha (Jessica Gabor) to pick him up after he got too inebriated to drive home one night — and proceeded to livestream the arrest when she was pulled over for driving without a license. Without his comedy career, he devotes all of his attention to mending the rift in his family — but he still gets recognized as “The Machine” everywhere he goes.Bert attempts to be a normal dad at Sasha’s 16th birthday party, but his plans are foiled by the unexpected appearance of his father Albert (Mark Hamill). Albert owns the best carpet business in southwest Florida, and his understandable pride in that fact fills him with a cockiness that he uses to torment his son. He passive aggressively judges everything Bert does, from his grilling abilities to his ability to provide for his family without a job. But their father-son feud is quickly disrupted when Irina (Iva Babic), a tough-as-nails Russian criminal, shows up to beat the shit out of Bert.As it turns out, his viral stand-up bit made its way to the Russian mobster who has spent 25 years looking for his missing pocket watch. He deputized his brutal daughter to get it back, and when Bert reveals that he doesn’t have it, she forces both him and his father to accompany her to Russia to search for it. (The movie is a lot better if you don’t question why Irina assumes that Bert knows the location of a piece of jewelry he hasn’t seen in a quarter century that’s floating around somewhere in a country that spans two continents.)When they get to Russia, Bert opts to retrace his steps to try and find where he last saw the watch. But his drunken memories are rather hazy, so the unlikely trio embark on a “Hangover”-style attempt to recreate the trip. First they visit the dorms he stayed in and find the stash of weed brownies that he buried in the wall. Then they take the train from Moscow and get drunk on the bar car where the theft took place. But Russian mafiosos are not known for their patience, so Bert’s inability to find the watch quickly pisses off an endless stream of Russian goons that they have to fight.Making Bert recreate the trip is a clever device for turning a stand-up bit into a film, as the different locations serve as backdrops for the comic to perform segments of his stage routine. But “The Machine” really goes off the rails when it tries to turn itself into an action movie. The blandly violent fight sequences are only watchable because Hamill gets the occasional opportunity to show off his dorky-dad-on-cocaine schtick between punches — at one point he gleefully refers to himself as “Molly Parton” after enjoying a bunch of drugs. Kreischer eventually realizes that he has to get drunk and take his shirt off if he wants to save the day, a conclusion so painfully inevitable that you’ll curse yourself for sitting through the 90 minutes it takes him to get there.While it’s nice to see Bert and Albert finally enjoy some of the father-son bonding that has always eluded them, it’s a little unclear what anyone actually learns in the process. The film begins with Bert cutting drugs and alcohol out of his life for the sake of his family… then he goes to Russia and gets shitfaced in order to learn what really matters in life. But hey, his wife and daughters seem happy at the end, so who are we to judge? Maybe now he’ll be enough of a gentleman to merely call them “crazy bitches” when he gets mad.A Sony release, “The Machine” opens in theaters on Friday, May 26.",

        "title": "‘Vincent Must Die’ Review: ‘John Wick’ Isn’t Nearly as Interesting When the Guy’s a Schlub",
        "content": "Vincent (Karim Leklou) is the kind of man who is so unremarkable that middle age seems destined to render him invisible. He posts sad selfies that make you wonder if he’s ever seen a photograph before. He cracks weird little “jokes” about how the intern at work is late with his coffee, despite being reminded that the intern doesn’t do coffee runs. His girlfriend recently dumped him. The man radiates such a pathetic energy that you just want to give him a hug — or perhaps a book of Civil War trivia to occupy his lonely nights.So why, then, does everyone who sees him try to kill him? It’s a very good question that “Vincent Must Die” never has to answer.From the moment we meet Vincent, quite a few people appear to agree that he must die. Everyone from new interns to longtime colleagues and total strangers on the street become possessed with an overwhelming desire to beat him to death from the moment they make eye contact. Stéphan Castang’s film cleverly opts to steal a leaf from the “Groundhog Day” playbook and never reveals the cause of the phenomenon. Instead, the film becomes a character study that examines what might happen when a man who is basically the human embodiment of the color beige is treated with the kind of animosity that’s usually reserved for John Wick.Vincent is a trooper, and he appears content to keep going into work at his architectural firm every day and simply putting up with the occasional beating. But his boss sits him down and explains that the daily attacks have turned into a distraction at the office. He asks Vincent to work from home — which seems like a good compromise, until the kids in Vincent’s apartment building start attacking him in the halls. When he gets caught beating up the elementary schoolers in self-defense, his neighbors understandably question his alibi about kids attacking a 40-year-old man for no reason. The incident turns him into a pariah who can’t be seen leaving his apartment while the neighbors are awake.At a certain point, Vincent realizes that “living in human society” is not a proposition that has a lot to offer a man with his newfound condition. So he decides to go on the lam, where other men begin to notice that he never makes eye contact with anyone. These men have a tendency to find each other, and Vincent learns that he’s not alone in his ailment. They’ve formed an underground society called The Sentinel, where they share survival tips on a discreet online forum.If you want to survive as a Sentinel, there are a few rules you have to learn very quickly. You need to learn to stitch up your own wounds, because hospital workers will probably try to kill you. You need to delete your social media accounts, because people will see you in photographs and try to find you. And you need to get a dog, because they’re the only species that won’t betray you and they can identify the scent of someone who has decided to kill you.Vincent retreats to his father’s decaying vacation home in the country, where he can be left alone to peruse his survivalist forums in peace. But grocery shopping is now impossible, so he begins parking outside a local diner and asking them to carry large amounts of food to his car. Despite radiating awkwardness and misanthropy, he somehow vibes with Margaux (Vimala Pons), the waitress tasked with delivering him his weekly food supply.They spark up a new connection that’s only hindered by the fact that she occasionally tries to kill him. But while his fellow Sentinels have sworn off human contact entirely, Vincent and Margaux become convinced that it’s worth trying to find a workaround. She agrees to regularly spend time with him wearing handcuffs and blindfolds so that they can get to know each other without any unplanned attacks. The lengths they have to go to just to enjoy the occasional date become more and more extreme — but when Vincent sees the deaths of despair that are beginning to overtake his lonely friends, they become more determined to make it work.“Vincent Must Die” gets started with an absolute bang. The darkly comedic first act is filled with genuine laughs as everyone in Vincent’s life tries to calculate the minimum amount of empathy that they’re supposed to offer this man that they don’t particularly care about. His therapist suggests that the attacks are the result of his attention-seeking behavior — a laughable suggestion considering his timidity — and one of Vincent’s attackers considers filing an H.R. complaint against him because of the inconvenience that the incident caused.Unfortunately, the very plot elements that make the beginning so much fun end up weighing down the rest of the film. The genius of the premise is that Vincent is so bland and vanilla that you can’t possibly understand why people hate him so much. But Leklou might be too good at playing a sad sack with nothing interesting about him. Once he drops out of society and removes himself from conflict, you’re left watching a character study about a character who isn’t worth studying.It becomes clear that the appeal didn’t lie in Vincent himself, but in the way he interacted with the world. His inability to navigate the nuances of office politics was wildly entertaining. Watching him order sad takeout meals and attempt to fix his septic tank by himself, not so much. His romance with Margaux never shakes the aura of being a contrived plot device, because it’s just never believable that anyone with a pulse would see this guy as a love interest.Castang and screenwriter Mathieu Naert seem to tease us with the multitude of exciting paths that the film could go down before ultimately choosing the least interesting one. Instead of continuing with the dark comedy or fleshing out the mythology of The Sentinel, they take the darkest route and leave us with something that begins to resemble a generic zombie movie by the end. The natural response to the first few dozen attempts on Vincent’s life is righteous indignation at the poor man’s mistreatment. But after an hour and a half, it’s fair to wonder if the possessed mob is onto something.“Vincent Must Die” premiered during Critics’ Week at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "title": "Cannes 2023 Palme d’Or Predictions: Here’s a Look at the Likely Winners",
        "content": "At the start of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, Swedish director Ruben Östlund told a roomful of journalists that he would rather win his third Palme d’Or than an Oscar. For this year, at least, the previous Cannes winner for “Triangle of Sadness” and “The Square” will have to settle for handing the Palme d’Or to someone else. As the president of this year’s jury for the Official Competition of the 76th festival, Ostlund is leading a team of nine writers, directors, and actors (as well as two writer-director-actors): Fellow Palme d’Or winner Julia Ducournau (“Titane”), Brie Larson, Zambian filmmaker Rungano Nyoni, Moroccan filmmaker Maryam Touzani, Paul Dano, French actor Denis Ménochet, Afghan director Atiq Rahimi, and Argentinian director Damián Szifron. The group will spend the festival watching two to three competition films per day, and Ostlund has said that they will gather to deliberate every three films over the course of the 10 day festival. That process will culminate on Saturday, May 27, when the group will meet for a final time and vote on the Palme winner along with prizes for acting, writing, directing, and a few other categories. The ceremony will take place at 8:30 p.m. There is no exact science to predicting the Palme d’Or race. Each juror gets one vote, including the president, and jurors are instructed to keep a tight lid on their reactions to movies over the course of the festival. In the past, some have abided by this rule better than others, and rumors run rampant either way. Films that receive the most critical support aren’t always the obvious frontrunners (the acclaimed “Toni Erdmann” lost to the sentimental “I, Daniel Blake” in 2016), though wild, subversive filmmaking often supersedes more traditional storytelling (just look at “Triangle of Sadness” and “Titane,” the winners of the last two years). It can be all too easy to make assumptions about jury preferences based on their own work. At the same time, for this guessing game, Cannes obsessives need all the clues they can get. IndieWire’s annual list of Palme d’Or predictions only includes odds for movies that have already screened at the festival. It is updated daily as new films screen, so check back to see the latest odds throughout the festival. ",

        "title": "‘La Chimera’ Review: Josh O’Connor Is a Grieving Tomb Raider in the Best Indiana Jones Movie of the Year",
        "content": "Editor’s Note: This review originally published during the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Neon will release “La Chimera” in theaters March 29, 2024.Just when it seemed like Cannes couldn’t get any worse for “Indiana Jones and The Dial of Destiny,” it turns out that James Mangold’s $300 million sequel wasn’t even the festival’s best movie about a sad and grumpy archeologist who chases a band of tomb raiders across the waters of Italy in order to stop them from selfishly exploiting a priceless artifact from before the birth of Christ. What are the odds? Strange as that coincidence might be, it’s no surprise that Alice Rohrwacher’s new film is better than a Disney blockbuster that happens to share the same general milieu, but it’s worth pointing out that the arthouse version of this story is far more entertaining than the studio blockbuster take. It’s also shorter (if only just), sexier (by a lot), and Isabella Rossellini-er (imagine her doing a catty, live-action riff on her character from “Marcel the Shell with Shoes On”). It even has a better villain, played to perfection by an obvious but unexpected European star whose performance here could be slotted into a summer tentpole without missing a beat. But enough kicking dirt on an old relic that should never have been dusted off again in the first place — there’s a new discovery to celebrate. The third and most romantic installment in Rohrwacher’s informal trilogy exploring the relationship between Italy’s past and present, “La Chimera” finds the Tuscan filmmaker returning to the rustic charm and eternal regret of “The Wonders” and “Happy as Lazzaro” in order to stretch them across a richly textured canvas that spans from ancient Etruria to “The Crown.” It begins with a man played by Josh O’Connor — famously not Italian — dreaming of the woman he loved and lost. His name is Arthur, her name was Beniamina, and this idyllic vision of their reunion is rudely interrupted by a ticket-taker aboard a gorgeous country train as it rumbles across the Florentine countryside during the mid 1980s. “Sorry, you’ll never know how it ends now,” the ticket-taker chortles. But Arthur isn’t one to give up. Legend tells of a buried door that connects this world to the next, and this surly archaeologist is so hellbent on finding it that he’s become the leader of a ragtag gang of tombarolis — lovable grave-robbers, essentially — in the small village where his Beniamina once lived. He offers the group his sorcerer-like ability to dowse the location of ancient treasures, and in return they do the digging for him. Stealing 2,000-year-old pots and statues out of the earth isn’t exactly legal work (Arthur is returning from the latest of his many stints in jail when the film begins), but the group makes a decent profit by selling whatever they find to a mysterious local fence named Spartaco, who operates like a Bond villain from their secret lair atop the local animal hospital. While that may sound like a sustainable existence for a mopey British ex-pat, Arthur is unwell. O’Connor — delivering most of his dialogue in near-fluent Italian that the other characters take pleasure in correcting at every opportunity — plays him like a man possessed. It’s not just the ticket-taker: Everyone who speaks to Arthur seems to be waking him from a dream that he was just starting to believe in, which helps to explain why the hulking Englishman is often just as short as he is tall. Dressed in the same billowy white suit for almost the entire film (the linen growing dirtier with each scene as Arthur grows increasingly subsumed by his obsession with locating Beniamina), O’Connor’s exquisite performance seems to channel Harry Dean Stanton’s haunted turn in “Paris, Texas”; less wraith-like in its physicality, but similarly intangible, like a man being played by his own shadow. Arthur straddles the liminal space between life and death with the same rugged beauty that Rohrwacher traces the overlap between the sacred and the profane, and so the central question of “La Chimera” isn’t whether he’ll be able to find his lost love (who, by definition of the film’s title, must always remain a mirage), so much as whether he’ll be able to stop looking.The only people who seem capable of distracting Arthur from that obsession are Beniamina’s ailing mother (Rossellini, hilarious as a poison-tongued Miss Havisham type who mercilessly teases anyone who steps foot in her derelict mansion), and the old woman’s new music student, a tone-deaf beauty (Carol Duarte plays the pointedly named Italia, serving Miranda July realness as a dotty local do-gooder with a penchant for unofficially adopting orphaned kids). If Beniamina is emblematic of the past, Italia naturally embodies the present. Might she be Arthur’s salvation? The tombarolis mock Italia as a “broomstick,” while Arthur would seem to be more interested in a shovel, but his nascent affection for her is as layered and hard to parse as the movie’s own feelings about the Etruscan antiques that Arthur helps to unearth. The tombarolis see the things they steal as inanimate pieces of junk, and laugh at the ancients who never intended for them to be seen again — who buried their treasures as if they were pieces of their own souls. The most affecting of Rohrwacher’s playful flourishes, which include sped-up action and upside-down frames, shows a layer of skin disappearing from a tomb full of buried artifacts after they’re exposed to fresh air for the first time in 2,000 years, as if the mere act of laying eyes upon these things was enough to strip them of their beauty. For Arthur, however, the invisible is the only real beauty left in this world, which lends a light irony to the unspeakable gorgeousness of Hélène Louvart’s cinematography. Alternating between 35mm, super 16, and 16mm (and assigning each format to a different aspect ratio, so that Arthur only dreams in super fuzzy 4:3), Louvart helps level the playing field between the imagined purity of the past and the pastel lycra that everyone wears in the present. “La Chimera” gradually surrenders itself to Arthur’s mania. At one point, his obsession becomes so complete that I found myself wondering if all of the other characters we meet are spirits trapped between two different realms of existence. Even in the proper context, that read doesn’t make a ton of sense, but it sure would help to explain the unforgettable shot in the film’s opening minutes when Arthur pokes his head out of the train cabin to find everyone else aboard staring at him in the hallway, which might be as close as any live-action film has ever come to capturing the energy of “Spirited Away.” Like all of the films in Rohrwacher’s trilogy, the bucolic first half of “La Chimera” gives way to a more industrialized and faster-paced second half, with the energy here ramping up towards something that could almost pass for an actual “Indiana Jones” movie — especially once Spartaco’s henchmen steal our tombaroli’s most valuable find. But even after a clearly defined group of “bad guys” emerges, Rohrwacher herself resists any sort of moral judgment. Indeed, the film’s ending, however predictable it might be, is so poetic and affecting because it abides by an internal logic all its own. “Does it belong to everyone,” Italia asks of a derelict train station she discovers at one point, “or does it belong to no one?” It’s the ultimate question “La Chimera” asks of our relationship to the past, and one that this lush and lived-in adventure leaves tantalizingly open-ended, even if there’s precious little doubt as to when Arthur belongs, or to whom. “La Chimera” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Neon will release it in theaters later this year.",

        "title": "‘The Book of Solutions’ Review: Michel Gondry Explains His Creative Process in a Spirited Comedy About His Alter-Ego",
        "content": "It’s been a long time since the last Michel Gondry movie (and perhaps even longer since the last time you actually saw one), but at least the “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” director’s semi-autobiographical new comedy offers a fun — if also fraught and occasionally worrying — explanation for why it took him eight years to follow up “Microbe & Gasoline.”In “The Book of Solutions,” Pierre Niney plays Marc, an obvious Gondry stand-in who’s deep in post-production on a $5 million film that looks an awful lot like Gondry’s own “Mood Indigo.” And much like Gondry did with that surreal 2013 romance, which was maligned for its messy overabundance of rich ideas, Marc is struggling to find a coherent shape for his would-be opus. “Anyone, Everyone” already sounds worryingly open-ended and ambitious based on its title alone, and it doesn’t exactly instill confidence in Marc’s financiers when he reveals that he’s still tweaking the fifth act. He tells them that he needs to step out for a cigarette, but in reality Marc plans on running downstairs to his office, stealing all of the hard drives, and absconding with them to his aunt’s house in the Cévennes — the same house in which Gondry squirreled himself away with “Mood Indigo” — where he can re-edit the movie at will. Or, as it turns out, where he will do literally anything else instead of finishing the film that he can’t bring himself to watch. As you might expect from a whimsical and relentlessly imaginative craftsman who’s only able to calm his anxious (and seemingly neurodivergent) mind when tinkering around on set, “The Book of Solutions” isn’t a movie about the agony of making art so much as it’s a movie about the agony of living with the art that you’ve made. Like Gondry, Marc is animated by the spirit of invention; by the part of the creative process where everything is still liquid and unsettled. And like Gondry, Marc is petrified of the part that comes next, when a filmmaker is limited to the footage they captured on the shoot. There’s obviously no end to how you can play with that footage, but there comes a time when a film begins to tell you what it wants to be — and to reveal nauseating truths about who you are for making it. For Gondry, the most horrifying self-discoveries of all were ultimately the ones he made about himself during the frenzied process of trying to avoid whatever “Mood Indigo” might have taught him. Specifically, he learned that his all-consuming creative mania could be a real drag on the people who love him most, a group that includes both his aunt (the subject of Gondry’s documentary, “The Thorn in the Heart”) and his long-time collaborators. But if “The Book of Solutions” might occasionally read as something of a mea culpa, the movie is that much richer because Gondry conceived it as more of an explanation than an apology — albeit one that’s far too sensitive to suggest that “genius” requires or allows for people to be assholes. That starts with Niney’s performance, which is childishly grandiose in a way that inspires a degree of sympathy for even his most annoying traits. Marc’s brain has its drawbacks (whose doesn’t?), but his unfettered imagination is also a gift worth cherishing. It’s what made his crew want to work with him in the first place, and it’s what makes Gondry’s movie about him so amusing to watch. “The Book of Solutions” is — first and foremost — a high-energy ode to the joys of being possessed by a creative spirit, and the pleasure that Gondry takes in telling a plot-light story that’s driven by pure invention is both palpable and contagious. Yes, we’re a bit concerned by Marc’s decision to stop taking his antidepressants cold turkey, but we’re complicit in wanting to go along for the ride. His sweet aunt Denise (a delightful Françoise Lebrun as the loveliest enabler alive) gives us tacit permission to sit back and enjoy, even if his loyal editor (Blanche Gardin as Charlotte) and his possibly smitten assistant (Frankie Wallach as Sylvia) aren’t so at ease.The mania starts when Marc discovers a leaf with a perfectly cut pinhole in its flesh, which allows him to see the world through a whole new lens. After that, it’s only a matter of time before he’s making a feature-length documentary about an ant, dreaming up some (flawed) ideas for how to “save millions of lives” by making driving safer, and even agreeing to take over as the mayor of his aunt’s little town. Once in a while, his ideas are ostensibly in service of finishing his film (e.g. Marc instructs Charlotte to start editing the movie in reverse, and later hosts a laugh-out-loud funny jam session with the very famous music icon he recruits to write the score), but more often than not they’re in the service of never finishing his film.The most telling of these episodic flights of fancy finds Marc suggesting that the four-hour-long “Anyone, Everyone” should include a brightly lit stop-motion short that plays during intermission so people who need to pee can find their way to the bathroom without breaking the spell for everybody else. I’ll give you one guess at what happens exactly halfway through “The Book of Solutions” (which runs a far more reasonable 102 minutes). In a movie that’s never coy about its relationship to real life, this self-reflexive flourish still functions as a uniquely tacit admission that Marc and his maker are one and the same; Gondry’s film isn’t just about the inner-workings of his mind, it’s also the ultimate product of them. It’s a shame that “The Book of Solutions” eventually settles into a traditional narrative arc — complete with a romance between Marc and an eccentric intern played by Camille Rutherford — because Gondry’s disinterest in telling a story is as obvious as his enthusiasm for everything else. The nature of this project doesn’t allow his avoidance of an ending to be quite as extreme as that of his main character (though a third act shoot-out almost threatens to bridge the gap), and Gondry’s film ultimately becomes so conflicted between celebrating Marc’s process and accommodating for it that the Book of Solutions itself — the self-help tome that Marc writes when it becomes easier for him to “solve” all the world’s problems than finish his film — comes off as a mere afterthought. But that too is another point of synchronicity between Gondry and his alter-ego, and the non-ending that he leaves us with here only helps to cement the impression of an artist who will never be able to change his stripes. For the first time in a long time, he’s made a movie that should make everyone happy for that. “The Book of Solutions” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "title": "‘Perfect Days’ Review: Wim Wenders’ Quiet Japanese Slice-of-Life Drama",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Neon releases the film in limited theaters on Wednesday, February 7, with expansion to follow.Wim Wenders‘ latest, “Perfect Days” plays like the culmination of filmmaker’s long tryst with Japanese virtuoso Ozu Yasujirō, which includes Wenders’ 1985 Ozu documentary “Tokyo-Ga,” and manifests here as a distinctly Ozu-esque observance of life and rhythm. First commissioned as a short film project celebrating Tokyo’s state-of-the-art public toilets — the great social equalizer — Wenders snatches the concept and doesn’t so much run with it as much as he strolls with it in the park while contemplating dreams, the dignity of labor, and the fleeting joys of waking moments.Yakusho Kōji plays Hirayama, a quiet, middle-aged toilet cleaner, and the embodiment of contentment, or so it would seem. He begins every day in his closet-sized duplex by carefully watering his plants, folding his mattress beside his enormous shelf of books and cassette tapes, and peeking his head outside his front door to soak in the morning air. Wenders captures his routine at eye-level, meaning he starts out at floor level, all but kissing the ground with his camera (itself an act of appreciation), before locking on to close ups of Hirayama on his long drive to work in his minivan, carefully stocked with cleaning supplies.Popular American needle drops abound, each justified by Hirayama attempting to soundtrack his own life (his morning commute starts with The Animals’ “House of the Rising Sun”), followed by a diligent and detailed depiction of the aforementioned public loos, each uniquely designed, and each an architectural and technical marvel in its own right. At the end of his day, he joins smiling strangers and acquaintances for a hot meal at a local eatery.The routine repeats, each time with a more condensed montage so that, like Hirayama, the audience never grows tired of it. Even annoying deviations are usually minor, involving Hirayama’s young slacker coworker (Emoto Tokio), who’s as impressed with as he is perplexed by Hirayama’s dedication to the job. His brief lunch breaks involve a trip to a garden where he snaps film photographs of nature, scenes which are mirrored by moments during his workday when his gaze happens to fall upon some gorgeous pattern of light shimmering across a concrete surface (courtesy of Franz Lustig’s poetic cinematography).A melancholy realization soon sets in: that Hirayama may be an artist of some sort, but he either cannot or will not follow his passions. Even his dreams, depicted in black and white, retread the day’s images and events in condensed, impressionistic form. He lives a life of small satisfactions in the present — his life is all about being present — even though there’s practically no hint or indication beyond that for lengthy stretches.It takes well over an hour of the film’s 2-hour running time before we learn anything about who Hirayama once was, thanks to the sudden appearance of an eager niece he takes under his wing. Who he is remains cinematically intriguing, as the film spends its latter half slowly unraveling what lies beneath his veneer of contentment. However, Wenders approach to this dichotomy is devoid of cynicism; he presents Hirayama not as a walking falsehood, but as a truthful depiction of the way life should, in theory, be lived. His routine, his care and his kindness don’t exist as extensions of his unpleasant past — scant details of which eventually emerge — but they exist despite it.The character is aspirational in some sense, but never inhuman. Several vignettes see him crossing paths with other characters in distress, some of whom he helps, but he too has blinders on when it comes to the complete worlds of other people, which he has access to via the tiny, narrow window of his own perspective. If anything, his biggest “flaw” as a character is one shared by the camera: he only sees a small sliver of life at any given time.The film’s needle drops are undoubtedly on the nose (on paper, the soundtrack may as well be stolen from “Suicide Squad”) but its heavy-handed Gen X-ism — including Lou Reed’s “Perfect Day” — isn’t so much statement as it is desperate search. Hirayama is a man spiritually connected to the world around him, but “the world” in this case includes nature, concrete structures, light and temperature, though it seldom involves other people.His seeming lack of a past emanates as if from some void of human interaction and reflection, a disconnect about which other characters occasionally joke. It’s isolation by choice, and its reasons are never made crystal clear, though the film provides enough by way of hints and gestures that anything more detailed might feel like an interruption to a story where even the most naturalistic shots and performances betray a sense of abstraction.The film may feel slight at times, with few moments that truly punctuate its intentionally languid texture. But Hirayama keeps it feeling truly alive, as if the only direction Wenders had given Yakusho were to create a performance that, like “Perfect Days” itself, evokes (but never directly quotes) Shimura Takashi in Kurosawa Akira’s “Ikiru.” It builds, in the process, to a stunning and genuinely moving crescendo, born seemingly from the fact that no film, let alone one this restrained, could contain such highly-pressurized drama and internality, to the point that Wenders is left with little choice but to let a lifetime of Hirayama’s story exude from the screen all at once in a final, silent scene that’s worth the entire preceding running time.“Perfect Days” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.",

        "title": "7 Reasons Why We Left Cannes 2023 Happier Than We Arrived",
        "content": "Kohn’s Corner is a weekly column about the challenges and opportunities of sustaining American film culture.When you’re living in the bubble of daily cinema life during the Cannes Film Festival, it’s hard to know if the rest of the world cares about any of the movies you’ve seen over the past two weeks. The obvious marketing hooks for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” and “Killers of the Flower Moon” will take care of them. For everything else, who knows?The last three Palme d’Or winner winners — “Triangle of Sadness,” “Titane,” and “Parasite” — leveraged their Cannes success into genuine cultural impact. (“Titane” flopped, as did almost everything did in the omicron-centric fall of 2021, but it still left a mark on the conversation.) The challenges in getting movies made and seen is higher than ever, but Cannes 2023 came ready for battle. Here are some of the most promising signs I found. For a generation of cinephiles, the death of Jean-Luc Godard last fall felt like a breach. He was the last living link to the French New Wave (unless you count “The 400 Blows” child star Jean-Pierre Leaud, still kicking at 78) and made his most daring, revolutionary cinematic works in his later years. When he decided to end his own life at 91 via assisted suicide, it struck many as a de facto statement on cinema itself. The French New Wave epitomized the idea that filmmaking was a flexible art form designed to stir conversation and excite artists with the potential for constant experimentation. Without that spark, does the art form go stagnant?The legacy of the French New Wave isn’t finished yet. This year’s Cannes Classics section included a delightful peek at an unfinished Godard pitch for a feature project he was developing at the time of his death, “Phoney Wars.” A slideshow on Xerox paper proposes a work based on the late poet Charles Plisnier’s 1937 novel “Fake Passports” with a blend of film formats, filmed material, and essayistic asides. The project’s 20-minute pitch, aided by longtime Godard cinematographer and editor Fabrice Aragno, shows Godard was still in the process of creative soul-searching. It also suggests that Godard’s not done yet: There are more archives where this came from (sales company Goodfellas is working through various commercial possibilities).The legacy of the New Wave was visible elsewhere at Cannes, including a new documentary, “Viva Varda!”, on the late Agnes Varda’s poignant career. Her daughter, the producer Rosalie Varda, also unveiled an innovative new plan to restore her mother’s work and create a digital platform for classroom use, with support from Netflix and other investors.American film buyers must calculate for an uncertain market and conservative tastes. Several told me they were less interested in the market’s unfinished projects than seeing finished work: They wanted to see movies they could move on fast. That’s why everyone from Neon to Netflix waited an hour in the rain to get into the gala premiere of Todd Haynes’ “May December,” and Netflix skipped the after party to figure out how to make a competitive bid. They pushed past the streamer’s preference for all-rights deals and spent $11 million on U.S. rights. That’s a breakthrough at Cannes, where many movies are financed by pre-selling foreign territories. If Netflix grows more comfortable with acquiring rights in piecemeal, more movies stand a greater shot of acquisition. Everyone wants to get paid, so here’s hoping they remain flexible about what it takes to pony up on Cannes favorites.  Neon made a swift deal for the charming animated New York dramedy “Robot Dreams,” a nearly wordless slapstick story of a lonely dog and his robot companion. The company’s willingness to move fast might seem risky, but one year after buying “Triangle of Sadness” it proves Neon is one of the few significant specialty buyers willing to do so. The company also snapped up Justine Triet’s innovative murder mystery “Anatomy of a Fall.” Much of the movie is in English, but I’m told the dialogue is more than 51% French; it could end up as the country’s Oscar submission.Last year’s lively launch for “Top Gun: Maverick” set it on a path to gross over $1 billion worldwide. It’s unlikely that “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” will go the same route. (The movie will please fans with its dopey send-off, but not to the extent of Tom Cruise flying a jet.) However, Disney’s decision to bring Harrison Ford to town for a career tribute, and force the media in attendance to watch that decade-spanning montage before seeing the movie, provided the best launch the movie could hope for. Disney CEO Bob Iger was clearly impressed, and it may have helped him grasp what his specialty team at Searchlight was doing at the festival as it combed the lineup for acquisitions. (He declined comment by saying “You’re asking a lot of questions” and walking away when I asked him about this at a festival party.)Zaslav launched “Elvis” at Cannes 2022 and the festival wasn’t as kind this year (the launch for HBO’s “The Idol” made some noise, but reactions trended toward negative), but American executives appreciate the unique scale of Cannes for the right kind of global product. Martin Scorsese’s hardly a Cannes newcomer — but Apple CEO Tim Cook was, and with “Killers of the Flower Moon” he’s seen what Cannes can do. Forty years ago, Wim Wenders gathered Cannes directors into a hotel room and asked them if cinema was a dying art form in “Room 666.” In 2022, newcomer Lubna Playoust did the same thing with as many directors on the ground as she could find. The result is Cannes-nerd candy: Cannes hosted a special screening of “Room 999,” where everyone from eventual Palme d’Or winner Ruben Östlund to David Cronenberg sat in static shots as they muse on the present and future of the movies with genuine investment in the question at hand. There are a few Debbie Downers (when asked if cinema is dying, James Gray just says, “Yes.” ), but the movie functions as a gripping look at artists thinking through the challenge in real time. During the Cannes screening, after each filmmaker shared their thoughts, the crowd erupted into applause. “It’s not as if we’re dealing with a dying art form,” says “The Worst Person in the World” director Joaquim Trier. “We’ve discovered this machine that can talk about time and memory and play with identification. These things have been led into the world like Pandora’s Box.… They can be used to create havoc and chaos, but in the best possible way, they can show us humanism — that we are different, somehow.” But let’s give the last word to Cronenberg. Cinema “will evolve and transform as we are all evolving,” he says, adding that filmmakers must decide “if we want to be complete victims of the digital revolution, or remain masters of ourselves.” Bring on the AI debate.With 33 percent of the Cannes lineup directed by women, Cannes is still a long way from gender equity, but it’s improving. However, the festival is facing greater pressure than ever before to sort out its image problem. Comments made by former actress Adele Haenel assailing the festival for ignoring victims and supporting abusers generated a lot of attention and forced the festival to respond. A letter signed by several major French actors calling for better accountability at Cannes received widespread attention. The pushback seems to be working: Cannes has no choice but to evolve to meet the needs of a global community that wants to see better representation across the gender spectrum and sensitivity to the need for progress. And it’s getting there.There were no picket lines on the Croisette (Cannes banned them), but the WGA strike often came up at press conferences, and anyone forced to address the matter offered supporting words to the writers above all. That included Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, who said writers are the “first to be forgotten” because they’re “first in the process” and that she was in “full support” of “the writers getting what they deserve.”That may be a diplomatic non-answer, but now that Hollywood basically can’t get anything done, it’s enough to show that the WGA demands are inescapable. As possible DGA and SAG strikes loom, the industry must figure out a real negotiation sooner or later. Nobody can hide from the hard questions.New Cannes president Iris Knobloch told me in an interview that the festival is negotiating with the mayor for more space in the city, which is a relief: The notorious crowds of the Croisette felt especially gnarly this year. Take a wrong turn and you might get hassled by security and trapped behind a barricade. (One day, darting out of my apartment to a screening, I collided with a seagull speeding through the air. I have eyed others with suspicion ever since.) Later, I was moderating a press conference when a journalist fainted at the back of the room. Cannes director Thierry Fremaux himself got into a high-profile skirmish with a police officer while riding a bike down the Croisette. The chaos of Cannes comes for everyone. But here’s the silver lining: All those crowds are also proof of the demand in play. Cannes wouldn’t be such a shit-show if it didn’t attract influencers from every level of the industry. Industry pressure seems higher than ever for movies to get made and sold — or, at the very least, seen under the world’s most glamorous conditions. When buyers worked through a veritable mosh pit at the entrance to the new Aki Kaurismäki movie “Fallen Leaves,” one person diffused the tension by shouting, “The cinema is alive!” Indeed: Nobody would be fighting to see these arty movies if they weren’t worth fighting for. Cannes is always a sobering reminder of how hard it is get original movies made in America. France has 60 co-production agreements around the world (it just added Ireland); the U.S. has none. There is no clear path to auteur filmmaking in the States and original movies have to be nimble to survive.This year’s Directors’ Fortnight sidebar showcased three very low-budget movies that walked that gantlet: “Riddle of Fire,” “The Sweet East,” and “The Feeling That the Time For Doing Something Has Passed” are all innovative lo-fi indies with compelling ideas. “Riddle of Fire” is a grimy 16mm romp about a bunch of troublemaking kids wandering the woods. “The Sweet East” follows a rebellious teen on a surreal road trip across America. “The Feeling That the Time For Doing Something Has Passed” is a minimalist BDSM comedy set in a few apartments and bars around New York. They’re all rough around the edges in ways that fuel their aesthetic identity. The outcomes don’t feel compromised; they make the case for the future of cinema in small doses, which is a great way to play it safe and still take risks. Bring it on.Directors’ Fortnight got a mixed response this year as new artistic director Julien Reijl made a concerted effort to avoid obvious selections that were jockeying for spots in the Official Selection. Instead, he went for weirder, less commercial choices that the unofficial Cannes sidebar will screen across France in June. It created a space for a few smaller American movies that would otherwise have a hard time surfacing at a place like Cannes, and that sure felt like progress.

        "title": "Nicole Holofcener Keeps Things Streamlined with ‘You Hurt My Feelings’",
        "content": "“You Hurt My Feelings” is the latest exquisitely mounted comedy from writer-director Nicole Holofcener, the American cinema’s master of marital unease. The premise is classic Holofcener: A writer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) overhears her husband (Tobias Menzies) saying what he really thinks of her work and reevaluates what she thought she knew about her relationship and, by extension, her own identity. That reevaluation provides fodder rich in both comic possibilities and penetrating insights into the subtle negotiations, minor and major grievances, and temptations and disappointments that make up a long-lasting marriage. “You Hurt My Feelings” is unblinking in the pain it puts its protagonist through, yet the breadth of Holofcener’s perspective yields as much hope and genuine romance as it does awkwardness, alienation, and pain; it’s perhaps the closest any contemporary American filmmaker has come to Jean Renoir.What’s all the more remarkable is that “You Hurt My Feelings” clocks in at just over 90 minutes. Holofcener’s economy of expression as both a writer and director has become so streamlined that she can express an epic novel’s worth of ideas in less time than it takes most tentpoles to get through their character introductions. “I’m pretty brutal about cutting things out,” she told IndieWire’s Filmmaker Toolkit podcast. “I wish that so many movies were a half hour shorter.” That said, Holofcener isn’t the kind of director who drastically reshapes her movies in the editing room. “I can’t make my movies something they’re not through editing. It is what it is, you know? You just want to show the best movie you can and get the best performances from the footage.”Great performances have always been key to Holofcener’s work, and “You Hurt My Feelings” is no exception. The director’s instincts for casting are unerring, from the leads down to richly observed supporting characters who may only appear in a scene or two. Louis-Dreyfus and Menzies are particularly skilled at conveying complex emotions through simple gestures and line readings, exhibiting the same precision in their body language as Holofcener does through her camerawork. And given the vagaries of independent production, they often did so under less-than-ideal circumstances.“We shot the most intense scene, the scene where she overhears him, on the first day,” Holofcener said. “It was a tight schedule and we couldn’t shuffle things, and I think we only got the store on that day. It was unavoidable. So there was no history between these characters and the betrayal hadn’t been built up to. I don’t think the actors were happy that was their first day, but they did great.”That tight schedule meant that Holofcener came in every day with a thoroughly designed visual strategy, even if it might shift according to locations or performances. When asked if she lets the actors try out their own blocking before imposing her own thoughts, Holofcener laughed. “There’s no time for that! That’s just asking for disaster. What I’ll do is block out the scene with the DP and AD and write that down or draw pictures. The actors come on set and I say, ‘This is what I’ve blocked out. This is what makes sense to me. If you’re willing to try it, let’s try it. And if it’s not working we’ll change it.'”Even on rare occasions when actors resist the idea of predetermined blocking, Holofcener usually finds that they like what she has planned. “I would say, ‘Just try it.’ And often they’re like, ‘Yeah, this is actually what I was going to do.’ People kind of like to be told where to start from. They want to be directed.”",

        "content": "The Writers Guild of America 2023 strike is continuing to make a dent in upcoming Hollywood projects.The strike began May 2, with multiple productions halting in solidarity with the demonstrations. The WGA strike took effect after six weeks of unsuccessful negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, representing the likes of Netflix, Disney, Apple, NBCUniversal, Warner Bros., Paramount, Amazon, and more. Writers are demanding better pay, residuals structures, and protection against AI as a replacement tool for their work, among other concerns.While the strike has not yet affected some upcoming consecutive seasons of fan-favorite shows, “Saturday Night Live” and a handful of late-night talk shows including Jimmy Kimmel, “The Late Show,” and “The Tonight Show” have gone dark. Manhattan picketers have also protested outside filming on the latest season of “Billions,” though the long-running Showtime series has yet to come to a full stop.Drew Barrymore exited hosting the MTV Movie & TV Awards, which pivoted from a live ceremony to a pre-taped presentation on May 7. The American Film Institute also has delayed the 2023 AFI Life Achievement Award Tribute gala for Nicole Kidman, which was scheduled for June 10.Below, see every production and event postponed due to the ongoing WGA strike.May 26:-“Thunderbolts” (Disney/Marvel)After pausing production on “Blade,” Marvel Studios has now pushed back the filming start date for “Thunderbolts,” starring Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, David Harbour, Wyatt Russell, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Ayo Edebiri, and Steven Yeun. “Beef” creator Lee Sung Jin took over writing the film from a script penned by “Black Widow” scribe Eric Pearson.

We hope a fair deal is reached soon so we can all get back to work. Until then — over and out.”–“Evil” (Paramount+)Production on supernatural drama series “Evil” (formerly on CBS before it was moved to Paramount+ in 2021) wrapped Season 4 early at the Brooklyn Stages in New York amid picketers. “Evil has met its match,” strike captain Warren Leight tweeted on May 6. “Studio waited hoping they’d leave, because they didn’t want the headline that 3 guys walking for six hours shut the show down. But that’s what happened.”May 5:-“Hacks” (HBO)Series co-creator Jen Statsky confirmed that Season 3 of the comedy series halted production. “We are devastated to not be with our incredible crew and cast right now, but there was no other option here,” executive producer Statsky tweeted. “Writing happens at every stage of the process – production and post included. It’s what makes shows and movies good. It’s what makes them possible.” Production of Season 3 of “Hacks” began in November 2022 and was briefly paused in February 2023 as lead star Smart underwent heart surgery.-“Blade” (Disney)The long-delayed live-action “Blade” reboot starring Oscar winner Mahershala Ali hit yet another production snag amid the WGA strike. The Marvel movie was slated to begin filming in June in Atlanta, but cast and crew members were notified of a delay until the strike ends. Mia Goth co-stars in the film, which is now helmed by Yann Demange after Bassam Tariq exited the project in September 2022 two months before production was supposed to begin. “True Detective” creator Nic Pizzolatto is writing a new script draft using Michael Starrbury’s initial script.-“Loot” (Apple TV+)Season 2 of the comedy series starring Maya Rudolph was put on hold due to protests at the Universal Television Bel-Air location.May 4:-“American Horror Story: Delicate” (FX)The upcoming installment in Ryan Murphy’s horror anthology series was shut down at Silvercup Studios, as WGA members confirmed via Twitter.

        "content": "Elizabeth Olsen has learned a new superhero trait: saying no.The “WandaVision” actress revealed during the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast that her advice to fellow stars looking to join the MCU would be to only sign a contract for one movie to start. Olsen has played Marvel‘s Wanda Maximoff, aka the Scarlet Witch, for eight years and counting.“I’ve had some people ask about it,” Olsen told Josh Horowitz about actors asking for MCU advice, adding, “Just give them one.”Olsen continued, “I think that way you have more control over…If you, let’s say, ‘Oh my God, this is the most fun I’ve ever had and I love this character so much, I want to do it again,’ you now have more creative control for the next one.”She joked, “Don’t tell [David] Galluzzi that. [He’s] business affairs at Marvel.”Olsen told IndieWire that she was at first hesitant to lead Disney+ “Avengers” spinoff series “WandaVision,” a tentpole show for the then-budding streamer.“It felt scary to say yes to doing a TV show with these characters, and then putting it on an app that didn’t [yet] exist,” Olsen said. “It didn’t feel like a safe place.”Olsen reflected, however, “I’m really proud of what we’ve been able to do with the character — and characters, like with Vision (Paul Bettany). There was a growth there that I couldn’t have predicted.”The “Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness” actress previously addressed feeling “frustrated” over her personal MCU contractural obligations when trying to balance the blockbusters with indie films.“I had this job security but I was losing these pieces that I felt were more part of my being. And the further I got away from that, the less I became considered for it,” Olsen said. “It took me away from the physical ability to do certain jobs that I thought were more aligned with the things I enjoyed as an audience member. And this is me being the most honest.”",

        "title": "‘Creatura’ Review: A Boldly Lyrical Excavation of Lifelong Sexual Desire",
        "content": "There’s an unnerving veil hanging over the windswept beaches and quaint rural milieus that make up “Creatura,” a brave and remarkably self-assured personal excavation film. Hailing from Catalan filmmaker and actress Elena Martín Gimeno, whose performance as the central figure Mila is both reassuring and vulnerable, “Creatura” follows one woman’s relationship to her body, desire, and sexuality, beginning with adulthood and eventually leading to her earliest childhood memories. The film observes an erratic adult Mila as she drifts through a series of adolescent memories. As various chapters from youthful summers unfurl like dreams, she attempts to heal her relationship with her body. Elegantly crafted and brazen in perspective, the film was awarded Best European Film at the 2023 Cannes Directors’ Fortnight.It’s provocative, yes, but not overly titillating. Gimeno’s film is honest about the way girls are alienated from their own desires at every stage of development. Young Mila is shamed for seeking pleasure, her natural curiosity met with disgust and unease. As accustomed as we are to seeing distorted stories of female sexuality onscreen, it’s impossible not to spend much of the movie braced for some horrible trauma to be revealed. Mercifully, one never comes. But the fact that even small transgressions hold such power over Mila years later is its own tragedy, too. Under Gimeno’s deepening gaze, there are no small infractions. When it comes to sexuality, every intimated lesson becomes gospel.While the most important action in the film is internal, “Creatura” begins with a little girl sitting on the edge of a bed, either scratching or rubbing her vulva a little too vigorously. When she’s interrupted by her mother calling her name, she looks up — caught. We next meet 35-year-old Mila (Gimeno) and her partner Marcel (Oriol Pla), who are moving into her family’s summer home in Costa Brava after the death of her grandmother. They hug and kiss goodbye to her mother Diana (Clara Segura) and father Gerard (Alex Brendemühl), exchanging mentions of a visit later in the summer.That night, Mila initiates sex with Marcel, though he seems reluctant to put down his book. Once roused, he finds his groove until Mila stops him multiple times to stare into her eyes. Unable to continue, he retreats in frustration. The next morning, she wakes up with a terrible rash all over her upper thighs and stomach. The couple repeats this cycle many times throughout the film, caught in an agonizing and confusing dance of pursuit and rejection. Both confused, Mila understands little of what is ailing her, and hapless Marcel is left on the outside. When a local waiter greets Mila warmly at dinner the next night, Marcel curtly points out he was staring at her chest.When the film jumps back in time to Mila’s teenage years, she is now in the same house with her parents. Gimeno wisely keeps these chapters fairly self-contained, lingering long enough in the past to create a full vignette. As such, they don’t feel like flashbacks so much as memories or dreams that Mila must interpret along with the audience. Mila at 15 (Clàudia Dalmau) is lively and curious, though not as bold as her more mature friend, who is perfectly delighted to flash her bra to random men on Messenger.When they happen upon a man touching himself, Gimeno steadies on the girls’ faces as their eyes first widen and then affix on the action — totally rapt. Teenage Mila is popular with the boys, though she soon learns it may be for the wrong reasons. Her frisky friend has been labeled a slut, as her paramour of the summer informs her. Suddenly made aware how easily the same fate could befall her, she tries to rebuff his advances but is pressured into a furtive handjob.Back in adulthood, Mila leaves the house after another argument with Marcel. Sneaking into the bar after hours, she dances and flirts with the waiter, who playfully accuses her of engaging in “regional tourism.” When she’s done here, she’ll go back to Barcelona and forget all about him. Back home and clearly turned on by her brush with adultery, she encourages Marcel to pretend she’s a stranger. The classic roleplay works at first, until Mila has to go and bring the waiter into it. Shortly thereafter, Marcel absconds to Barcelona without a word. When he returns, he says he needed a night with the boys.The past-facing parts of the film move backward in time, with the final chapter landing on the 5-year-old child Mila (Mila Borràs) from the opening shot. This little girl Mila has a fixation on her Papa, insisting he be the one to tell her bedtime stories and clinging to his broad shoulders in the ocean. Putting her to bed, she asks him to rub her bum after observing a couple on the beach. Sitting on an uncle’s lap, she bounces vigorously on his knee until he becomes uncomfortable and puts her down. The whole vignette ends with her father’s angry outburst after she interrupts her parents in bed.These childhood scenes with her father feel charged, mostly because of what we’re primed for in stories about sexual repression. But nothing distinctly horrible ever happens to Mila, other than her innocent exploration being met with discomfort and eventually rage. In an adulthood scene with her father, Mila wonders if she makes him uncomfortable. She can’t figure out why they’re not more physically affectionate after she lays her head on his shoulder and he pulls away. He doesn’t have answers for her, though her line of questioning drives him off the couch. A visit from her mother offers little explanation, though she does reveal that Mila always needed her bum rubbed to go to sleep.The memories are evocative and elegantly told, though they don’t add up to any grand revelation. Nothing in Mila’s childhood seems like the kind of thing that would make a grown woman break out into hives after sex. Like Mila, we’re left wondering where all of her confusion and pain comes from, and where it’s going. Even the film’s poetic final image leaves ample room for interpretation, though it’s undoubtedly optimistic about Mila’s healing journey. When in doubt, return to the sea.“Creatura” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival Directors’ Fortnight, where it won the Europa Cinemas Label prize for best European film. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "title": "‘No Love Lost’ Review: Erwan Le Duc’s Father-Daughter Dramedy Closes Cannes’ Critics Week with Whimsy",
        "content": "There’s an irony to the title “No Love Lost”: that the gaping hole left in a lover’s wake can still shape a person’s whole existence. In short, there’s plenty lost. Erwan Le Duc (“The Bare Necessity”) writes and directs the 2023 Cannes Critics Week closing film that was billed by the festival as a “bittersweet comedy about paternity and filiation with a poetic and off-beat angle,” and delivers on most fronts.Nahuel Pérez-Biscayart stars as Étienne, a hopeful football player who has a whirlwind romance à la “Up” with protester Valérie (Mercedes Dassy) in the first five minutes of the feature. The duo have an immediate connection after both evading the police at a demonstration, but their fearless young love (they’re in their very early twenties) soon becomes more complicated once Valérie discovers she’s pregnant. A wordless montage captures their love story up until Valérie drops off baby Rosa and Étienne at his parents’ house, promising to park the car but never returning.Étienne moves through the various stages of mourning across years of parenting Rosa: first, he’s holding out hope, and then begins moving through the world silently, paralyzed in heartbreak. It’s only when Rosa is about age 10 or so that he addresses Valérie’s departure, putting words to the vastness of his loss.“Absence isn’t a feeling. You can’t love someone absent,” Étienne tells Rosa who, in turn, promises to never leave him. This becomes the crux of the film once a teenaged Rosa (Céleste Brunnquell) is getting ready to depart for college, threatening to mirror in action the abandonment her own mother did.Rosa is always moving through the world and, according to her high school boyfriend Youssef (Mohammed Louridi), symbolically running from the shadow her absent mother has left behind. Plus, it’s just more convenient for Youssef’s budding writing career to grab ahold of Rosa and Étienne’s shared “trauma” and make it his own for the sake of inspiration.“She was your creator,” Youssef tells the father-daughter duo over dinner, citing the mark Valérie inadvertently left on them both. Yet Étienne is steadfast in viewing his trajectory differently: “My life isn’t tragic,” he responds.And Étienne believes that. He is pulled between exploring a new love with girlfriend Hélène (Maud Wyler) and protecting Rosa’s fleeting childhood, all while their family home is being sold. Rosa encourages Étienne to show his emotions, but he is the stoic pillar of being a sole parent. While Étienne is reluctant to shed the hope he still carries for Valérie’s return, Rosa is determined to understand the mother she never knew, even at one point kissing her own father to understand Valérie’s womanhood or the pull she had on Étienne.“No Love Lost” hinges on Wes Anderson-esque framing and lead star Pérez-Biscayart’s emotive eyes that always seem to be darting across every frame, silently searching for Valérie’s ghost in desperation for an answer to Rosa’s questioning. The quaint French film only becomes an overt physical journey to find Valérie in the last act; it’s the emotional build-up to the decision to even resurrect the idea of her that the film shines.There may be “No Love Lost” between Étienne and Rosa, but it’s the time lost on what could have been if Valérie stayed in their lives that fuels the fodder around the shared separation anxiety between father and daughter. The presence of this absence is what writer-director Le Duc is adept at toggling, and while his latest doesn’t break the mold, like Étienne and Rosa, it really is worth sticking around for.“No Love Lost” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "title": "‘Terrestrial Verses’ Review: Iranian Mosaic Shatters with Stories of Totalitarian Life",
        "content": "A woman with a lost dog, a small girl performing a TikTok dance in a chador, and a worn-out filmmaker trying to get his movie project off the ground are just three of the characters populating the omnibus of single-take vignettes in writer-directors Alireza Khatami and Ali Asgari’s “Terrestrial Verses.” Combined, these nine stories give off a powerful cumulative effect as we see the petty bureaucracies and paper-pushing quotidian blocks to working-class life unfold and whittle these people down. Cultural, religious, and institutional constraints wear down everyday citizens in Tehran in stories that may lack a beginning, middle, or end but still arrive at a well-drawn if eerie and ambiguous conclusion that would feel dystopic if the events weren’t so ordinary.The sole Iranian entry in the 2023 Cannes Official Selection, “Terrestrial Verses” opens with a panoramic, widescreen shot of the Tehran cityscape. At first gently and then overwhelmingly, the swell and clatter of urban noise, and eventually screaming and sirens and the sounds of panic, fill the scene before a cut-to-black that introduces us to the film’s first character. A new father (Bahram Ark) is told that the name he and his wife has chosen for their infant child, David, is too Western, and unseen lawmen says the government won’t approve their choice. Most of the vignettes are established talking-head documentary interview style, with the interviewers (in the form of police or government pencil pushers) placed behind the camera and never seen.In the next segment, an eight-year-old girl (Arghavan Sabani) bristles against the traditional garments an off-camera saleswoman pushes on her, wearing a Mickey Mouse shirt under her religious garb while dancing to pop music on headphones. The most powerful centerpiece of “Terrestrial Verses” finds a man named Farbod (Hossein Soleimani) trying to get a driver’s license, but he’s grilled about the collection of tattoos on his body, the self-inked scrawls of what he claims is a Rumi poem that turns out to be about binge-drinking.Another vignette resonates with recent controversies surrounding Iranian filmmakers like Jafar Panahi and Mohammad Rasoulof, imprisoned and banned from leaving the country (though Panahi has recently been freed) due to their outspoken anti-establishment political views. Here, a frustrated filmmaker Ali (Farzin Mohades) tries to establish a shooting contract with a producing partner after a widespread investor dropout over decades. But he’s told that his screenplay is too critical of the Iranian-Islamic patriarchy and more representative of what the partner alleges as Western hegemony. Ali is asked to rip out pages from his script, and include more stories from the Quran to present a more positive depiction of Islamic rule.Cinematographer Adib Sobhani frames each section — another harrowing sequence includes a school girl called into the principal’s office after being seen on a motorcycle with a boy — in the 4:3 Academy ratio, a literal embodiment of the claustrophobia each of these characters feel. The camera never moves, zooms, or flinches to make us feel suspended in each moment and aligned with the characters’ frustrations. As these are mere snapshots of life, some are more characters than others, with several citizens set up as more thinly sketched stand-ins for broader issues. Near the film’s closing, an elderly woman in hijab implores a policeman to release her missing dog, which the precinct may or may not have possession of. Who would want to use a Chihuahua as a police dog, she asks? She’s sent away empty-handed and destroyed by the slow-drip needling of questions.Famed Iranian actor Ardeshir Kazemi gets a silent cameo in the film’s final shot as a “100-year-old man,” according to the press notes, literally bent over by the shadow of totalitarianism as the city outside darkens, the frame broadens to a widescreen aspect ratio, and those sounds we heard in the opening sequence prove a disturbing, apocalyptic preamble to a city outside the man’s office finally combusting.Iranian directors Alireza Khatami and Ali Asgari joined hands after having their first features, “Oblivion Verses” and “Disappearance” respectively, selected for the Venice Film Festival in 2017. They described in press notes the process of getting their films off the ground as being like characters in “Waiting for Godot” — and the citizens they sketch in “Terrestrial Verses” are similarly caught in a waiting game to nowhere under the facility of totalitarian rule. This film is as muted in its approach to character and drama as its color palette, but the result is devastating.“Terrestrial Verses” premiered in the Un Certain Regard section of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "title": "Why Phil Lord and Chris Miller Call ‘Across the Spider-Verse’ Spidey’s ‘Empire Strikes Back’",
        "content": "After their mind-blowing “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” Oscar-winning producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller break even more animation rules in “Across the Spider-Verse,” the second installment in Miles Morales’ three-part journey about becoming the most creative and individualistic Spider-Man. (“Beyond the Spider-Verse” will be released March 29, 2024.)In “Across the Spider-Verse,” which the producers call their “Empire Strikes Back,” Miles (Shameik Moore) travels through several multiverses with love interest Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) and Spider-Society (led by Oscar Isaac’s Miguel O’Hara) to prevent the destruction of their worlds by Spot (Jason Schwartzman), who traverses time and space through inter-dimensional portals on his body.The producers began discussing the sequel with screenwriter David Callaham (“Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings”) during the completion of “Into the Spider-Verse,” and he provided a whole version of a slightly different story. “But a lot of the ideas that he came up with are in this picture and actually even more in the next,” Lord told IndieWire.“But once the first one was finished,” added Miller, “then we came together and started to figure out what was really important about Miles’ journey and how we could tell a really satisfying story that would be as emotionally resonant as the first one, but take us to a bunch of new places.”These new places comprise the aesthetically audacious world-building of “Across the Spider-Verse,” which far surpasses its game-changing predecessor. There’s Earth-65, where Gwen’s Spider-Woman hails from, designed to look like watercolor paintings; Earth-50101, home to Pavitr Prabhakar (Karan Soni), based on the Spider-Man India comics, which they dubbed “Mumbattan”as a mash-up of Mumbai and Manhattan; Nueva York, the futuristic world from Marvel 2099, where Miguel lives; the rebellious New London, inhabited by Daniel Kaluuya’s Hobie, the Spider-Punk; and a nightmarish world whose identity will remain spoiler free.“We like to celebrate when things don’t match,” Lord said. “Some people don’t like the work to have no seams, to be sanded down, and have no edges. I think, for us, the edges are the joyful part of it. And from an animation standpoint, obviously, our whole career we’ve been trying to push American studio animation into more radical places. And, for us, it’s an opportunity to showcase how limitless the possibilities are. And this story begs for it because you’re going to all these different worlds, and each one can look like its own bespoke animation style and have a reason to look that way.”And Miles serves as the perfect creative muse for the producers: a restless, artistic teen who believes anything is possible in charting his own path. “Miguel says being Spider-Man is a sacrifice,” added Lord. “That’s what we love about this character, that their obligation to the heroism is always compromising their personal happiness. It’s something we can relate to, and it’s something that makes these stories really rich.”Yet this sequel was a tremendous undertaking, requiring two stories to complete Miles’ journey and a whole new set of tools and techniques from Sony Picture Imageworks. Three new directors joined the team to provide fresh voices: Joaquim Dos Santos (“The Legend of Korra”), a specialist at action choreography; Kemp Powers (the “Soul” co-director and Oscar-nominated screenwriter of “One Night in Miami”), who sharpened both the cultural authenticity of Miles as a superhero of color and the universality of his coming-of-age story; and Justin K. Thompson, the production designer of “Into the Spider-Verse,” who brought great leadership in harnessing the expansive world-building.If “Into the Spider-Verse” broke the Imagework pipeline in creating a moving 3D comic book, then “Across the Spider-Verse” broke it again, five times over, with an unprecedented crew of 1,000 artists and technicians. Only this time they had a slew of Marvel comic book designs and some of the original artists to help guide them in translating the very specialized 2D looks into 3D animation.Gwen and her world required a new watercolor and mood ring simulation tool. “There were a couple of programmers that were a humongous part of our crew,” Miller said, “whose job it was to facilitate all this stuff. It’s easy to say the world should drip away and the color should change around her as her mood changes. But someone had 18 months of R&D to figure out how to teach the computer to paint it.”Meanwhile, the look of Mumbattan embodied the Marvel India comics of the ’70s that were made with exotic inks and offset-printed so the colors crossed the lines. “You really feel the quickness of the artist drawing, and we wanted to represent that because, if you go to Mumbai, it moves fast and there’s a lot going on,” added Lord. “And we wanted that immersive feeling out of that technique. Luckily, we figured it out in time for the film‘s release, but barely.”Although we only get a brief glimpse of the ’70s punk scene in New London, it’s based on poster collages. “Homemade, torn and cut, and the idea that [Hobie’s] a walking collage,” Miller said. “But how do we render this in three dimensions?” added Lord. “How do we take the information that we have and then sort of photograph it, photocopy it, distort it, and move it around and have it change, but not have your eye get lost or confused? It comes down to the lighting artists because the solutions to each shot cannot make it look like the shot before or after. They have to be bespoke to that one shot. And they have to emphasize the unusual qualities of each shot in each environment.By contrast, the look of Nueva York, partially inspired by the neo-futurist illustrations of Syd Mead (“Blade Runner”), contained beauty bumping up against brutalism. “The trick there was how to get the markers to look right without being totally distracting, like 12 frames a second of a million squiggles,” Lord said. “The thing that you love about that concept art from the ’80s was a lot of it’s drawn on top of boards that are not always pure white. And some of it is light over dark…there’s negative space under the drawing, but it hasn’t been finished yet.“And you can see the lines on Miguel,” he continued, “like the pencil is unfinished. It’s kind of a cruel joke on Miguel, who’s essentially asserting that the future is written, but the image is constantly undermining his argument and saying, in fact, the future is not completely fleshed out.”Then there’s nemesis Spot (scientist Jonathan Ohnn), who alone required 17 new tools. He evolves throughout the film, going from a rough drawing to a fully formed character, with each ink drop in his body looking and behaving differently. However, the idea for him as the supervillain came from Marvel Studios’ founder Avi Arad after much resistance from the producers, who thought he was out of a Looney Tunes cartoon.“When Avi first suggested it, we ignored him for too long,” Lord said. “We thought, ‘That’s the dorkiest villain,’ but he said, ‘No, his power’s actually way more powerful than anyone realizes.’ And then we thought it was thematically very interesting. It’s kind of funny to take a villain who seems like a joke and feels left out and alone the way that Miles does, and they’re going on a similar journey, but his is the darker path. He’s trying to fill a hole in his heart with more holes.”The artists and technicians made Spot look like a moving, constantly changing environment. They drew him in blue and inked on top. And then the blue disappears during the printing process. “But in our movie, we wanted to see it and then the spots themselves,” Miller said. “The animators control the spots, but then they had to go through VFX to have the sort of roiling.”Lord added that it was like oil on glass meets spilling ink into a fish tank with dry erase marker and wax pen on top of it. “It has this overwhelming style,” he continued “Once he takes fully engaged form, that was its own other R&D thing, and those shots weren’t finished until a month ago. How do you make something that’s empty look right? How do you take negative space and depict it as colorful and roiling when it’s basically pitch black? People are just starting to scratch the surface of what is possible [in CG].”",

        "title": "Tarantino Says 007 Producers Wouldn’t Meet with Him Because ‘It Could F*ck Up Our Billion Dollar Thing’",
        "content": "Though virtually all of Quentin Tarantino‘s nine movies have been original stories — only “Jackie Brown” was adapted from the Elmore Leonard novel “Rum Punch” — the director and obsessive cinephile has kicked the tires on some of Hollywood’s biggest franchises over the years. From Marvel projects to an R-rated “Star Trek” movie, Tarantino loves to flirt with opportunities to work with his favorite characters. And sometimes, it seems like the only thing he loves more than making movies is talking about the movies he almost made.In a new interview with Deadline, he recalled his failed attempt to put his own Tarantino-esque spin on the James Bond novel “Casino Royale” years before the Daniel Craig adaptation came out.“We reached out to the Ian Fleming people, and they had suggested that they still own the rights to ‘Casino Royale,'” Tarantino said. “And that’s what I wanted to do after ‘Pulp Fiction’ was do my version of ‘Casino Royale,’ and it would’ve taken place in the ’60s and wasn’t about a series of Bond movies. We would have cast an actor and be one and done. So I thought we could do this.”But Tarantino and his clever legal maneuvering were no match for longtime Bond franchise producers Albert and Barbara Broccoli, who had already made moves to ensure that nobody could adapt Fleming’s works without their involvement.“But then it turned out that the Broccolis three years earlier figured out somebody was going to try to do what I did,” he said. “And so what they did is they just made a blanket deal with the Fleming estate and said that: ‘We have the movie rights to everything he’s ever written. We’re going to just give you a bunch of money. This is for every single thing he’s ever written. If anybody wants to make a movie out of it, they got to come to us.’”When asked if he ever had a formal meeting with the Broccolis, Tarantino said that the negotiations never even got that far. The auteur explained that the producers were fans of his style but weren’t interested in dramatically altering the Bond formula.“No, but I had people who knew them and everything,” he said. “I was always told very flattering versions of like, ‘Look, we love Quentin, but we make a certain kind of movies, and unless we fuck it up, we make a billion dollars every time we make that type of movie, OK? We don’t want him to do it. Doesn’t matter that it will still do good. It could fuck up our billion-dollar thing.'”While Tarantino certainly won’t be directing a Bond movie any time soon — he claims he’s retiring after his upcoming film “The Movie Critic” — he still has a few ideas about the direction the franchise should go in. He explained that he would like to see the next slate of 007 movies remake the original stories but still adhere to the plots of Ian Fleming’s books more closely.”I mean, they always start from scratch when it comes to somebody new, because that’s saying somebody couldn’t have been going through the stuff that happened in ‘Thunderball,’ all right? I’ll tell you, I actually have a thought process about this,” he said. “What I think they should do, and I’ve been thinking they should do this for a long time, is so many of the books have these really classic names and really classic adventures. And for the most part, a lot of them, they never did the book. They never did the stories. They took the plot line and maybe the Bond girl or maybe the villain and then just went their own way. Tom Mankiewicz just goes his own way. He did the writing for a lot of them. I think they should not remake the movies but actually just do the books, but do them the way they were written. And those would all be brand new.”",

        "title": "‘Barbie’ New Trailer: Margot Robbie’s Best Day Ever Is Ruined by an Existential Crisis",
        "content": "Is this the real life, or is this just a doll fantasy?Margot Robbie leads Greta Gerwig‘s “Barbie,” centered on the history of plastic womanhood in all her glory. Generic Barbie (Robbie) ventures outside of her dreamland and finds herself caught up in the real world alongside Ken (Ryan Gosling) during a path of self-discovery. Simu Liu, Hari Nef, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, John Cena, Dua Lipa, and more play other variations of the dolls, while Will Ferrell stars as a Mattel executive antagonist. America Ferrara, Michael Cera, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Nicola Coughlan, and Emerald Fennell also star.Director Gerwig co-wrote the script alongside partner Noah Baumbach, with no one from Mattel, lead star Robbie’s LuckyChap production banner or Warner Bros. reading any part of the script until it was completed.Robbie ensured that LuckyChap structured the deal so Gerwig and Baumbach could have an “open” creative process, “which is really fucking hard to do,” she told Vogue. Robbie said of finally reading the script, “We just looked at each other, pure panic on our faces. We were like, ‘Holy fucking shit.’ I think the first thing I said to Tom was, ‘This is so genius. It is such a shame that we’re never going to be able to make this movie.'”The presence of Ken was modeled as an “accessory” to Barbie, with Gerwig telling Vogue, “Barbie was invented first. Ken was invented after Barbie, to burnish Barbie’s position in our eyes and in the world. That kind of creation myth is the opposite of the creation myth in Genesis.”The film was inspired by old Technicolor musicals, with the cast screening films like “The Red Shoes” and “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg” as part of “movie church” during production. The first trailer for the film included a direct homage to Stanley Kubrick’s “2001: A Space Odyssey” and multiple double-entendre spoofs like wordplay on a beach fight.Actor Liu teased “big intricate dance sequences” featuring a diverse array of Barbies and Kens, saying earlier this year, “Greta was very, very conscientious about who she cast. We were able to cast people of different shapes, sizes, differently abled, to all participate in this dance —all under this message of: You don’t have to be blonde, white, or X, Y, Z in order to embody what it means to be a Barbie or a Ken.”“Barbie” premieres in theaters July 21, going Stiletto-to-Army-boot with “Oppenheimer” at the box office.

        "title": "‘The Boogeyman’ Review: In This Stephen King Adaptation, the Real Monster Is a Terrifying Lack of Subtlety",
        "content": "Early in Rob Savage’s “The Boogeyman,” a haunted (understandably, given what we learn about his tragic backstory) Lester Billings (David Dastmalchian) attempts to show a guarded (understandably, given what we learn about his tragic backstory) Will Harper (Chris Messina) a hand-drawn image of the monster that Lester claims murdered his three young children. That there’s an actual monster at play in this Stephen King adaptation isn’t up for debate — the film‘s opening moments even show said monster creeping out of a closet, whispering a horrible mix of aped human conversation and animal moans, and killing a kid — but the shape it takes, both literal and figurative, is initially presented as a mystery.Still, whatever therapist Will sees in his patient Lester’s drawing (and in Lester himself) is enough to send him straight to the cops; since we don’t also see the image when he does, it hints at a subtle, sneaky horror fable to come. Too bad: Savage’s film, written by “A Quiet Place” creators Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, along with “Black Swan” screenwriter Mark Heyman, quickly jettisons the primary questions of King’s creepy short story — what is the Boogeyman and what does it want? — and reveals both the monster and its bloodlust in surprisingly short order. Neither King’s story nor Savage’s occasionally clever direction lack for compelling ideas, but once “The Boogeyman” goes all in on becoming a screeching, jump-scare creature feature, most of its merits are hacked and slashed into oblivion.Ostensibly built on the bone-deep horror that is grief, Savage’s film opens with the introduction of two ruined families: Lester’s three children are dead, and he’s compelled to share what happened to them with Dr. Harper, a man going through his own heartbreak after his beloved wife recently died in a car accident. When we first meet the remaining Harpers, including teenager Sadie (“Yellowjackets” star Sophie Thatcher, and the real star of this film) and tween Sawyer (Vivien Lyra Blair), they’re a month out from the death of their mom and things aren’t going well. The girls are finally heading back to school, and Will is again seeing patients in his home office, but communication between the trio is at an all-time low (that Will sends Sadie and Sawyer to another therapist, because he is unable to talk to them about their pain, is one of the film’s most compelling bits). Enter: Lester.When the ruined husband and father appears in Will’s office, even he — the most repressed man in the world — can’t deny him. And then Lester starts spinning a tale about a monster who kills kids, his kids, when their parents aren’t paying enough attention to them. Sound familiar, Will? Soon, Will is ringing up the cops, Lester is alighting for the second floor of the house, and oopsie, Sadie is there too, having snuck home after a truly terrible first day back at school. Cue the creepy sounds (Russell Topal’s sound design remains nerve-shredding throughout the film), the lurking dark shadows, the slamming doors, and at least one more horrifying death. Suddenly, the Boogeyman is the Harpers’ problem, and oh, what a problem it is.And yet, while Savage’s film unmasks our monstrous baddie early (and, yes, it sure looks like a cousin of the “Quiet Place” aliens, whatever that’s worth), the perimeters of this seemingly ancient evil remain murky — we know it doesn’t like the light, but what’s the deal with the water everywhere? does it feed on grief or neglect? is it a spider, and if not, what’s the deal with the damn webs? and, really, why can’t someone just turn on some goddamn lights? After the Boogeyman starts terrorizing young Sawyer, headstrong Sadie is compelled to investigate (that Messina goes MIA during long stretches of the film is either a wily character choice or the product of bad scheduling; it’s unclear which applies here).Thatcher (who looks a bit like Anya Taylor-Joy and sounds a lot like Emma Stone) is a captivating on-screen presence, but she’s hamstrung by a script that forces her into classically stupid situations — don’t go into the basement! why are you opening that door? turn on a goddamn light! Still, this new take on the Boogeyman story requires some kind of human hero, and Thatcher gamely steps up. As her little sis, Blair is also quite good and ably telegraphs both terror and drama without going over the top. (That no one initially believes Sawyer is, to her, just as unsettling as the monster in her house; it’s a tough line that Blair taps into with ease).There’s no shortage of good ideas here, from the heavy (like how different people grieve or, in some cases, don’t grieve) to the very clever (like how kiddie nightmares can give way to actual terror), but from the second that “The Boogeyman” reveals itself, Savage’s film ceases to be interesting or scary. There’s nothing scarier than things that go bump in the night, but the terror is easily dispelled once we turn on the light and see what’s really there. That’s the lesson of King’s story, but Savage’s adaptation fails to understand that there’s nothing more frightening than the unknown.Disney will release “The Boogeyman” in theaters on Friday, June 2.",

        "title": "Wes Anderson, Jonathan Glazer, and Indiana Jones: Screen Talk Live at Cannes",
        "content": "The Cannes Film Festival always make a lot of noise, but this year’s edition has been especially rich with buzz for movies certain to stay in the conversation in the months ahead. Harrison Ford was celebrated with a lifetime achievement award ahead of “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” and HBO’s edgy pop star series “The Idol” stirred debate. Todd Haynes’ “May December” unleashed a erotic thriller with Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore that sold to Netflix for $11 million, while Apple unveiled Martin Scorsese’s sprawling “Killers of the Flower Moon,” and Wes Anderson brought his huge ensemble to the festival for his colorful meta-fiction “Asteroid City.”With so many higher-profile entries in play, it can be tricky to take the temperature on Cannes in real time, but IndieWire’s Eric Kohn and David Ehrlich did their best to make sense of the last few days during a live recording of our Screen Talk podcast from the American Pavilion.They also touched on the hectic climate of Cannes and how it ends up informing the overall experience of the movies themselves, then juggled a series of audiences questions on subjects ranging from filmmaker relationships to the sudden impact of artificial intelligence.During the podcast, Ehrlich previewed his response to “Asteroid City,” and later expanded on those thoughts in his review:Like any movie by Wes Anderson, “Asteroid City” is the epitome of a Wes Anderson movie. A film about a television program about a play within a play “about infinity and I don’t know what else” (as one character describes it), this delightfully profound desert charmer — by far the director’s best effort since “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” and in some respects the most poignant thing he’s ever made — boasts all of his usual hallmarks and then some. A multi-tiered framing device, diorama-esque shot design, and Tilda Swinton affectlessly saying things like “I never had children, but sometimes I wonder if I wish I should have” are just some of the many signature flourishes that you might recognize from Anderson’s previous work and/or the endless parade of A.I.-generated TikToks that imitate his style.Meanwhile, the Palme d’Or race has been loaded with possibilities. “It can be all too easy to make assumptions about jury preferences based on their own work,” Kohn wrote in his predictions piece. “At the same time, for this guessing game, Cannes obsessives need all the clues they can get.” Watch the full episode above or listen to it below.Screen Talk is produced by Azwan Badruzaman and available on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, and Spotify, and hosted by Megaphone.

        "content": "Chloé Zhao has gone from intimate dramas in the American West to massive Marvel blockbusters, and now she’s entered the world of gaming. Kind of. The Oscar winner has teamed up with video game publisher Blizzard to direct a live-action trailer for their upcoming video game “Diablo IV,” set to release in two weeks.The trailer, which Zhao co-directed with Kiku Ohe, is set in the video game’s world of Sanctuary, the realm of humans constantly caught in the middle of the battles between heaven and hell. The trailer features actors portraying the game’s five playable classes — Barbarian, Sorcerer, Druid, Rogue, and Necromancer — fighting various monsters and ending with a shot of the game’s primary antagonist, the demon Lilith.  “Working with Blizzard, we had the wonderful opportunity to bring the dark, thrilling and imaginative world of ‘Diablo IV’ to life,” Zhao said in a statement. “’Diablo’ fans are very passionate, and many have been with the game for over two decades. We want to do right by the fans, honor the game’s rich lores and visceral world-building while evoking the strong emotions the players feel while immersing in the game.”Created by David Brevik, the “Diablo” franchise is a series of action role-playing games that see players traverse a series of procedurally generated dungeon levels on a quest to kill the titular antagonist, the demon lord of terror. The first game launched in 1997, and the first two sequels followed in 2000 and 2012. Last year saw Blizzard launch “Diablo Immortal,” an MMORPG extension of the series. The franchise overall is one of Blizzard’s most critically acclaimed and has sold over 24 million copies worldwide.Zhao has a few upcoming non-trailer projects in the pipeline. The “Eternals” and “Nomadland” director is attached to a sci-fi western version of “Dracula” for Universal, which has been in the works since 2021. Most recently, she boarded an adaptation of Maggie O’Farrell’s novel “Hamnet,” which focuses on the marriage between William Shakespeare and his wife Anne Hathaway and the death of their only son. Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal are both in talks to star in the upcoming historical drama.“Diablo IV” launches on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PCs on June 6.

        "title": "Quentin Tarantino Reveals ‘Movie Critic’ Plot Details: It’s About a ‘Porno Rag’ Journalist",
        "content": "Quentin Tarantino is finally confirming his presumed final film.The director told Deadline that “The Movie Critic” will begin “pre-pre-production” this June, with Tarantino looking for an actor around 35 years old to play the lead. “The Movie Critic” is based on a “porno rag” journalist whom Tarantino read growing up working as a vending machine restocker. The film is set in 1977 Southern California, with a character arc similar to that of Robert De Niro’s as Travis Bickle in Martin Scorsese’s “Taxi Driver.”“All the other stuff was too skanky to read but then there was this porno rag that had a really interesting movie page,” Tarantino recalled of reading the magazine as a teenager. “He wrote about mainstream movies and he was the second-string critic. I think he was a very good critic. He was as cynical as hell. His reviews were a cross between early Howard Stern and what Travis Bickle might be if he were a film critic. Think about Travis’ diary entries.”The “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” director added, “But the porno rag critic was very, very funny. He was very rude, you know. He cursed. He used racial slurs. But his shit was really funny. He was as rude as hell. He wrote like he was 55 but he was only in his early to mid-30s. He died in his late 30s. It wasn’t clear for a while but now I’ve done some more research and I think it was it was complications due to alcoholism.”For “The Movie Critic,” the magazine will be fictionalized as “The Popstar Pages.” As Tarantino summed up, the feature is “based on a guy who really lived, but was never really famous, and he used to write movie reviews for a porno rag.”As for casting, Tarantino noted that he is looking for a male American star in his mid-30s, noting it will be a new collaboration and not a longtime collaborator.“I haven’t decided yet but it’s going to be somebody in the 35-year-old ball park. It’ll definitely be a new leading man for me,” Tarantino said. “I do have an idea of somebody I can imagine doing it really well…”The “Pulp Fiction” icon is set to relocate to Los Angeles in June to “start seeing who else is out there” for casting.“I would say that for the most part that the Americans gave up their own ground,” Tarantino added, citing the influx of British and Australian stars putting on American accents. “I think it’s just a case that a bunch of Brits just became more famous than the others. The Americans ceded their own ground. When I look at ’70s cinema I want to see Robert De Niro, I want to see Al Pacino, I want to see Stacy Keach, you know, I want to see people like that reflecting the culture back to me.”“The Movie Critic” will be set the same year that “Rolling Thunder” premiered. Tarantino presents “Rolling Thunder” at Cannes this year. The film’s screenwriter Paul Schrader previously told IndieWire that Tarantino approached him about remaking the ending scene from “Rolling Thunder.”",

        "title": "Why ‘Little Mermaid’ Director Rob Marshall Cut a Classic Animated Sequence from His Live-Action Version",
        "content": "[Editor’s note: The following interview contains some spoilers for “The Little Mermaid.”]While Rob Marshall’s live-action spin on the animated Disney classic “The Little Mermaid” holds fast to many of the elements that made Ron Clements and John Musker’s 1989 animated gem such a winner, there are still plenty of changes to the material at hand. And while Marshall and screenwriter David Magee mostly added new material to the existing story (or offered clever tweaks to stuff like, ohh, the species of a certain squawky bird pal), there were a few things they cut from their feature.That includes one of the best — and, yes, silliest — musical sequences from Clements and Musker’s kid-friendly original, second-act ditty “Les Poissons,” sung by no less than René Auberjonois as a truly demented chef.It’s undoubtedly the film‘s wackiest sequence, as it follows Sebastian the crab (voiced in the animated film by Samuel E. Wright; Daveed Diggs takes over for Marshall’s version and is aces) as he makes his way through the royal family’s nightmarish kitchen. As Chef Louis hacks and slashes his way through a dizzying array of foodstuffs (read: lots of Sebastian’s own kinfolk), the wily crab attempts to hide, injecting some serious physical comedy and wacky hijinks into the feature.So, what would that have looked like in Marshall’s live-action world? Instead of tackling the sequence, Marshall and his team opted to cut it.“Well, that was the problem: [what] would that look like? That really is an animation concept,” Marshall said during a recent interview with IndieWire. “It felt like Saturday morning cartoons. That kind of thing, you can really do in animation, but in a different genre, it just wouldn’t work. It’d be so silly.”It also just didn’t fit into Marshall’s overall vision for the story, not just in terms of how it looks but the way it functions within the moment at hand.“Also, it takes a vacation from the story, full on,” the filmmaker said. “So, you’re like, well, why is it there? I think if we had filmed it, it would’ve been impossible to make work, but also it would’ve been [cut] out, because it has nothing to do [with the story in that moment]. It’s a lovely song, but it just doesn’t belong in a live-action film. That was the real reason.”Disney releases “The Little Mermaid” in theaters on Friday, May 26.",

        "title": "‘About My Father’ Review: Robert De Niro Is an Italian American Hero in Zippy Comedy",
        "content": "There’s no doubt that Robert De Niro is funny, but his recent taste in comedies have certainly called his sense of humor into question. It’s been over 20 years since “Analyze This” and “Meet the Parents” launched the robust comedy leg of the Oscar winner’s career, but not every subsequent project has been as successful. Following the twin head scratchers of “Dirty Grandpa” and “The War with Grandpa” (unrelated; though equally ignored), the godfather of Hollywood has finally found his comedy groove again.And wouldn’t you know, all it took was a good, old-fashioned Italian American family farce — fittingly titled “About My Father.” Though there’s a wide swath of the public for whom De Niro can do no wrong, even giants can fall. Luckily, Sebastian Maniscalco knows the importance of family.The marquee comedian appeared opposite De Niro in Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman,” sealing his fate as the next generation of Italian American talent. Taking up the mantle with requisite finesse, Maniscalco stars in a zippy comedy (which he wrote with Austen Earl) about a guy introducing his traditional Italian father to his wealthy potential in-laws. In a refreshing pivot from his typical tough guy bravado, De Niro’s Salvo is a humble yet charismatic hairdresser who loves his son, even if he has a hard time showing affection. Playing a fictionalized version of himself, Maniscalco’s Sebastian provides an antsy counterbalance as the striver anxious to hide his working class roots.The two men seem to share genuine affection and camaraderie, which makes it easy to root for the central relationship. If some of the culture clash jokes trade on stereotypes, it’s such a relief to laugh in a theater that it’s hard to care. Hollywood favors formulas for a reason: They work. And lately, Hollywood seem to have forgotten that audiences like to laugh.The premise of “All About My Father” is fairly straightforward: Sebastian wants to propose to the love of his life, the mercifully age-appropriate Ellie (Leslie Bibb), with his grandmother’s wedding ring. But his opinionated Italian father Salvo wants to meet her family before he’ll hand over the heirloom. Begrudgingly, Sebastian invites Salvo to Ellie’s family home in the pristinely named White Oaks Country Club for Fourth of July weekend. Even though, as Salvo says: “He’s worried his immigrant father’s gonna make him look like some kind of goombah.”When they pull up to the oh-so-stately estate, they are greeted by Ellie’s parents, Tigger (Kim Cattrall) and Bill (David Rasche), who smother her with hugs and kisses. They’ve already met her douche-bro brother Lucky (Anders Holm) on the helicopter ride over, the spiritual opposite of her sensitive brother Doug (Brett Dier), who heralds them with his sound bowls and plays recorder for the pet peacocks. While Doug’s kombucha obsession and the family’s matching monogrammed pajama sets are a little much, Cattrall and Rasche play off each other wonderfully to inhabit the old-moneyed coddlers. This particular version of the blue-blooded American family, while obviously farcical, at least feels somewhat fresh with their overly affectionate positive vibes parenting style.As Salvo feels ever more out of place amongst the oblivious elites, Sebastian is worried his father will notice how much he longs to join them. A friendly tennis game turns nearly lethal when Sebastian strips his “Sopranos”-style tracksuit for crisp tennis whites, before unleashing an overhead towards Lucky that nearly threatens the family line. Cattrall offers a cruel reminder of exactly what’s missing from “And Just Like That” with her fretful delivery of: “Oh no! Give us a small cup of ice water for his testes!”Her character gets decidedly more screen time than Rasche’s, tipping the balance ever so slightly away from the classically masculine father/son dynamic. Director Laura Terruso, who co-wrote the Sally Field dark comedy “Hello, My Name Is Doris,” uses her sharp comedic timing to smooth what could easily have become unwieldy group scenes. With the comic beats tightly edited, Terruso keeps the ensemble dynamics afloat during a dinner scene gone awry and an ill-advised Flyboard ride that leaves Sebastian with his pants down.Aided by some genuine zingers in Maniscalco and Earl’s script, De Niro delivers one of his best comedic performances in years. When asked if he’s enjoying his private chopper ride, he replies: “Yeah, it’s nice. Reminds me of ‘Nam.” Sebastian gets some prime jabs in, too, like when he ribs Salvo’s outfit by saying: “You look like the guy who killed John Wick’s dog.” And an adorable bit of choreography takes the edge off of their evening arguments when they each spritz their “night cologne” before bed.So maybe we’re a little short on patience for the plight of the Italian American working man, but “About My Father” wisely doesn’t ask viewers to sympathize too much with any of its characters. It pulls no punches when it comes to skewering the out of touch elite, but it also doesn’t demand pity for anyone else or lament the decline of American masculinity. “About My Father” may not have much to say, and that’s just fine. Secure in his standing as a marquis comedian, Maniscalco makes movies like a guy with nothing to prove, and his confidence buoys and brightens “About My Father.” Unlike many male writers his age, he is mercifully free of any agenda — besides reminding the world that De Niro is hilarious.Lionsgate will release “About My Father” in theaters on Friday, May 26.",

        "content": "Julia Fox is channeling her “Spring Breakers” energy this summer.The “Uncut Gems” actress told Page Six she is currently in pre-production on film “Lipstick Palm,” which she co-wrote with Sara Apple. Fox described the feature as “‘Weekend at Bernie’s’ meets ‘Spring Breakers,'” citing the dark comedy aspect of the drama.“It’s about these two girls and they are in L.A.,” Fox said. “They are classic. One is an aspiring actress, and the other is a nepotism baby — but her dad had like seven kids, so the pool has been diluted. They’re drug addicts, so they are in recovery, but they are always in and out. One has a sugar daddy. There is a dead body involved somewhere.”While Fox penned the script, she is not directing “Lipstick Palm” but may helm a feature in the future.“My friends always say I would make a great dictator, but what I am hoping they mean is that I would make a great director,” the “No Sudden Move” star quipped.In the meantime, Fox will appear in Tony Kaye’s dark comedy “The Trainer” opposite Steven Van Zandt, Vito Schnabel, Bella Thorne, Taylour Paige, Gina Gershon, Lenny Kravitz, and Paris Hilton. The film follows a fitness expert, played by Schnabel, who has an existential crisis over the course of eight sleepless nights. Fox is also set to star in “The Puppet,” written and directed by Adam and Chris Levett. Additionally, Fox is releasing a memoir and has been rumored to be cast as Debi Mazar in the since-shelved Madonna biopic with Julia Garner reportedly cast as the “Like a Virgin” pop icon.Fox finding inspiration in “Spring Breakers,” one of the best indie films of the 21st century, comes on the heels of Kim Kardashian’s SKIMS campaign with director Harmony Korine in honor of the film’s 10th anniversary. Both Fox and Kardashian count Kanye West as an ex. Fox previously said she lost out on roles due to her relationship with the controversial artist, admitting in November 2022, “I’m not getting as many offers as I was before, weirdly. There’s been a lot of weird drawbacks with reaching that level of notoriety.”",

        "title": "‘The Taste of Things’ Review: Food Is Love for Juliette Binoche in This Period Amuse-Bouche",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. IFC Films releases the film in select theaters on Friday, February 9, with expansion to follow.There is something to be said for a simple dish made with the best ingredients by a trusted hand. Just as a perfect omelet made by a lover is more satisfying than an eight-hour feast laid on by a Prince, so it follows that a film like “The Pot-au-Feu” (later retitled for American audiences as “The Taste of Things“) works, not in spite of, but because it focuses on executing its basic premise with enrapturing attention to detail. This is a story about love and food, which it presents as the same thing.Sight unseen, it was always a mouth-watering prospect: two delicious French actors – Juliette Binoche and Benoît Magimel – feeding each other in Tran Anh Hung’s adaptation of a 2014 graphic novel reputed to be food porn. The promise of this set-up is delivered with gusto as the kitchen of a 19th century French manor house becomes the stage for the most elaborate foreplay you’ve ever seen. What “Call Me By Your Name” did for peaches “The Pot-au-Feu” does for syrup pears. The Prince of Eurasia, who courts his taste buds, refers to Dodin Bouffant (Benoît Magimel) as “the Napoleon of culinary arts.” Although he has a suite of loyal gourmets who love to gather at his table to contemplate the consommé, the person with whom Dodin is most comfortable is Eugénie (Juliette Binoche), his cook of 20 years. Their methods of cooking are complementary: she is fluid and gentle, he is frank and passionate and, yes, you guessed it, these modes extend to the way they approach l’amour. It is implied that Dodin has been proposing to her for the better part of two decades and although Eugénie sometimes leaves her door unlocked for him at night, she is not as open when it comes to marriage. “We’re already happy,” is her logic and it’s true that Binoche has never been more beatific, delivering her entire performance from somewhere close to cloud nine.The film opens in the only place that matters, the kitchen, as Eugénie takes a luxurious amount of time to prepare a four-course meal for Dodin and his disciples. She is assisted by maid/sous chef Violette and Violette’s young niece, Pauline — the owner of a precocious palette. DP Jonathan Ricquebourg’s roving camera is fascinated by the abundance of ingredients and cooking procedures, ducking and diving and zooming in on Eugénie sieving, flaming, braising, decanting, roasting, whisking, plating, drizzling, clarifying, and much more. Dodin cannot keep away from this locus of sensual creativity. As he knows better than to meddle with Eugénie during her artistry, he focuses on young Pauline, spooning a mouthful of sauce into her mouth and asking her what ingredients she detects. He has all the obsessive focus of fashion designer Reynolds Woodcock from “Phantom Thread” yet the nature of his vocation has made him generous. It’s hard to be an asshole when you eat as well as he does. It’s something of a gag that the 2023 Cannes Competition line-up also contains Jessica Hausner’s “Club Zero” in which characters move toward an ideal of consuming nothing at all. Whereas that film explored the spiritual value that grifters project onto denying the body its appetites, this one spins a vision of happiness that is predicated on the deep nurturing power of food. Not just any food. This is also about personal taste and how if someone knows your stomach, they know your heart. The romanticism of food here is not even symbolic, for Eugénie and Dodin’s synchronicity on the matter of making beautiful and precise dishes means that they are soulmates. Important declarations, when they come, are served with garnish on gorgeous crockery.Tran Anh Hung’s core skill is that of a top saucier, he knows how to add a glut of ingredients and reduce them to a rich flavor that moves the palate in ways that defy what seems like a simple dish. The most hypnotic sequences are virtually dialogue-free and work like ASMR as spoons tinkle, brass pots steam, wine glugs, crockery clanks and all the while Magimel and Binoche exude a meditative commitment to the practical tasks that they are performing. Although some of their shared contentment stems from wealth — part of the wonder of being in this world is in admiring the top-of-the-range-for-1885 kitchenware and ingredients — this is also a film that vaunts the body without shame. Anh Hung establishes a humorous rhythm so that long sequences of intense food preparation are punctuated with explicit sexual behavior. Eugénie is subject to fainting spells, so Dodin decides it’s time for him to cook for her. After preparing a thoughtful series of lavish yet delicate courses, breathing heavily as he pushes sliced truffles inside a chicken, we cut to a shot of Eugénie later, her naked back and butt facing him. This is a world in which finding someone who loves you is indistinguishable from finding someone who loves the same things as you. This state of affairs is presented as Nirvana, and the few scenes to take place outside of the kitchen involve golden light on rich green fields. There is humor, also, in Magimel trying to stay calm when he is served dishes that do not meet his standards. Dodin is not a character who wishes to throw his weight around, Gordon Ramsay-style, but his quiet horror is palpable when the turbot does not taste right, or a cook cannot rise to the challenge of following a soup recipe that covers two sides of A4. Pauline becomes his protege and they are charming together, all the while Eugénie only grows in stature as no one else can seem to do what comes so naturally to her — as naturally as breathing. Belonging to a fine tradition of intoxicating food films — “Babette’s Feast”, “Julie & Julia”, “Like Water For Chocolate” amongst others — “Le Passion de Dodin Bouffant” pushes the notion of bonding through vittles a step further. Certain dishes are so inscribed by their creators that they act as memory itself, says the film, a sentiment that leaves a beautiful after-taste.“The Pot-au-Feu” premiered In Competition at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.",

        "title": "For Disney’s Summer Blockbusters, Success Is Far from Guaranteed",
        "content": "Disney, we know, has problems. There’s streaming, the contentious relationship with 2024 Republican presidential candidate/Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the fates of Hulu and Searchlight, layoffs — but as the dominant film distributor for the last decade, its film slate is known as a reliable source of strength. In 2023, that’s no longer a sure thing.In the summer of 2019, Disney films represented 43 percent of the season’s $4.3 billion domestic take. Some box-office analysts have suggested that it’s possible that we could see a $4 billion summer — up $600 million from a resurgent 2022. However, May’s shortfalls make this is unlikely — and much of that falls to Disney.“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” opened May 5; the live-action remake of “Mermaid” opened in previews today. Upcoming are “The Boogeyman” (June 9), “Elemental” (June 16), “Indiana Jones and Dial of Destiny” (June 30), and “Haunted Mansion” (July 28). It’s a slate as mainstream as a studio can muster.All but the Fox-produced “Boogeyman” (around $40 million) cost well over $100 million, perhaps as much as $300 million. All told, the six films almost certainly cost over $1 billion to produce, then hundreds of millions more to market.The studio is coming off the highly profitable “Avatar: The Way of Water,” which grossed over $2 billion worldwide before home platforms. It also had “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” with an estimated pre-marketing budget of $200 million. With a $476 million worldwide box office total, it will make a small profit at best.Disney doesn’t make these films to show a small profit. It makes them to score big in theaters, score big on VOD, and then score more subscribers on its streamers. This summer, the Disney slate is full of expensive risks.The key summer Marvel title recovered from a low opening of $118 million and is on track for $325 million domestic. Still, with a $250 million budget, that’s disappointing. “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” from the same time last year brought in $411 million, and with a B+ Cinemascore compared to the A for “Guardians.”Estimates diverge on how this might open with ranges from $80 million-$130 million for the three-day weekend (Monday’s holiday will add more.) With an estimated budget of $200 million (based on past live-action remakes of animated classics),As a potential point of comparison, the 1989 animated “Little Mermaid” saw about a third of the attendance of the 1994 animated “The Lion King.” The 2019 live-action “Lion King” grossed over $600 million (adjusted).The 2023 live-action “Mermaid” found mixed reviews, as did the live-action “Lion King.” A potential factor in its reception is celebrating a diverse cast at a time of right-wing hysteria about a supposed “woke” Disney.This Stephen King adaptation cost about $40 million — low budget, by Disney standards. One of the few options for a summer sleeper, any success might nudge Disney away from all-franchise nearly all the time.“The Super Mario Bros. Movie” is over $550 million; “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” is expected to see huge results. As for Pixar’s latest original animated film — file it under To Be Determined.Just before COVID, Disney Animation’s “Frozen II” grossed $477 million and its in-house animated titles have struggled ever since. Those released theatrically (two with 30-day windows) failed to reach $100 million in domestic grosses. Last year, only the disappointing “Lightyear” saw a significant theatrical window.Based on Pixar precedent, the cost here might approach $200 million. What helps justify the cost is the same thing that could hurt its grosses: During the pandemic, Disney exploited many of its films (including Pixar releases) for exclusive, same-day, or early-window Disney+ play. If this falls short, that expectation might be part of the reason.Certainly Disney hoped that the Cannes magic dust that fell upon “Top Gun: Maverick” and Tom Cruise last year would happen for this film and Harrison Ford. Attention achieved, as well as a decidedly tepid response and an emphasis on its iconic star being 80.With $300 million as the reported budget, Disney could gross $200 million domestic, $450 million worldwide, and struggle to turn a profit. Ford’s last film in a lead role to exceed $100 million was “The Force Awakens” in 2015; before that it was “Indiana Jones and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” in 2008. It also won’t benefit from the immediate release that boosted “Maverick.”Kudos to Disney for assigning top films to directors with creative credibility. Case in point: Sundance discovery Justin Simien (“Dear White People”) directed the latest theme ride adaptation, “Haunted Mansion,” joining the franchise canon of “Pirates of the Caribbean” and the 2021 “Jungle Cruise.”The last starred Dwayne Johnson, which opened in theaters with same-day Disney+ and PVOD availability. Even so, it grossed $120 million domestic.“Mansion” might provide late-summer comic relief with a cast that includes Tiffany Haddish, Jared Leto, LaKeith Stanfield, Jamie Lee Curtis, Owen Wilson, Rosario Dawson, Danny DeVito, and Winona Ryder.It speaks to the nature of current franchise mindset that this sounds like the most original and fun title in the bunch.",

        "title": "‘A Brighter Tomorrow’ Review: Nanni Moretti’s Optimistic but Uneven Look at Modern Filmmaking",
        "content": "For Italian writer-filmmaker and national cinema mainstay Nanni Moretti — a veteran whose first film dates back to 1976 and whose 2001 drama, “A Son’s Room,” took the Palme D’Or at Cannes — the familiarity of his themes and fascinations may be a balm to some, but is also possibly verging on the tiresome. In “A Brighter Tomorrow,” Moretti once again stars as a version of himself — playing a character called Giovanni, his own full name — as an aging, curmudgeonly film director in contemporary Italy attempting to make a new film and scuppered at every turn by an untrustworthy financier (Mathieu Almaric), an unhappy wife of forty years (Margherita Buy, another frequent Moretti collaborator) and a combative cast.The film-within-a-film that Giovanni is making is a parable about the Italian Communist Party circa 1956, and the fraught decision of a couple of L’Unita newspaper journalists to either remain loyal to their Soviet masters or to break with them for their oppressive crushing of the Hungarian uprising. A Hungarian circus comes to town and the two journalists are divided on what they should do. A story about “the end of everything,” as one producer depressingly puts it, this is a film from a veteran filmmaker who is sick and tired of modern cinema and the capitalist vulgarity that surrounds it.What follows in “A Brighter Tomorrow” is likable and not totally without merit. Giovanni is an artist and husband who is set in his ways and determined to stick to a model for cinema, life, and politics which follows his artistic and moral principles — not shooting violence for mere entertainment, for instance, as he muses at length about Kielowski’s “A Short Film About Killing,” or making films which express the communist struggle so close to his heart.Meanwhile, Giovanni’s wife and creative partner Paola is exhausted by his stubbornness and unwillingness to listen to her; he says he needs her, but she retorts that actually she is just useful to him. Behind his back, she sees a psychoanalyst and makes plans to leave him, but even when she does, she is unusually friendly and helpful to Giovanni in his work. Their relationship seems something of an afterthought, even as Moretti appears to at least try to address gender dynamics in these types of marital situations.Forced by circumstances to examine his approach to filmmaking and to his intrapersonal relationships, Giovanni ultimately decides to alter the outcome of his film, which had originally been written as a suicide.Filmmaking, life, politics: Moretti’s projects share much of this common interest and free-flowing, often unstructured DNA while varying considerably in their overall impact. His 2015 film “Mia Madre” was a similarly personal story, featuring the director-as-actor and telling another meta tale of filmmaking and its vagaries. This inwardness can volley between insightful and painfully navel-gazing, giving “A Brighter Tomorrow” an unsteady quality. A highlight comes in the pointedly funny scene of a Netflix meeting that Giovanni and Paola take when their funding has stalled: the executives repeat numbers to them like robots and insist on the film having at least one “what the fuck moment.”Yet for every engaging character-driven moment or bit of warm humor (Giovanni angrily shouting “I’m going to call Martin Scorsese” certainly got the audience in Cannes laughing), there’s unearned, even irritating quirkiness. The tendency for the cast and crew of the film to break into fantastical song and dance — or Moretti’s formal decisions, including abrupt last-minute flashbacks — simply don’t fit into the flow of the narrative or tone.It’s true that “A Brighter Tomorrow” takes on, at times pretty convincingly, the protagonist’s own creative and personal blinders, offering a critique of the principled but often-blind male auteur’s own arrogance can suffocate those around him. In one scene late in the film, as Giovanni suggests he needs a different conclusion for his project after deciding against a more downbeat one, there’s an enthusiastic rushing forth of ideas and cross-talk between his producers, family, cast, and estranged wife. Giovanni looks around beatifically at their cheerful demeanors, realizing, presumably, that he so rarely asks their thoughts that they are thrilled to contribute. This more effective — and optimistic — spirit of collaboration drives both the new chosen conclusion for the film and, as the title implies, one that is more of a piece with the communist ideals Giovanni’s characters espouse.Solidarity and humanity in the face of cynicism is laudable, undoubtedly. But it’s difficult to remain absorbed in the material at hand given Moretti’s somewhat clumsy swapping between present-day logistics of a film production, the film-within-a-film of 1956, and the random, irritating bursts into song (see: Giovanni in a car, histrionically singing Aretha Franklin). The results are frustrating and lessen the overall impact of the film, which has its heart in the right place, even if that place often feels stuck in the past.“A Brighter Tomorrow” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "content": "Cillian Murphy knew transforming into the “father of the atomic bomb” J. Robert Oppenheimer wouldn’t be a sprint, but rather an epic marathon.Murphy leads Christopher Nolan’s WWII period piece epic alongside Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., and Matt Damon, who recently praised Murphy’s dedication to the weighty role.“When you are at the center of a movie at that scale, shooting seven scenes in a day, it takes a different focus and concern and commitment,” Damon said of Murphy to The New York Times. “It’s beautiful to watch someone give themselves to it fully.”Damon, who plays U.S. Army lieutenant general Leslie Groves, called the role of Oppenheimer a “marathon” for Murphy.In the Times interview, Murphy also spoke about what physically went into his performance. “I love acting with my body, and Oppenheimer had a very distinct physicality and silhouette, which I wanted to get right. I had to lose quite a bit of weight, and we worked with the costume and tailoring; he was very slim, almost emaciated, existed on martinis and cigarettes.” He added, “He had these really bright eyes and I wanted to give him this wide-eyed look, so we worked on his silhouette and expressions a lot before starting.”“Air” actor Damon recently revealed he was oblivious to the “Oppenheimer” release date competing with Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie,” both in theaters July 21. “This is the first I’m hearing about it, actually. I haven’t paid any attention to that,” Damon said about the viral trend of asking who will buy a ticket for which movie opening night. “People are allowed to go see two movies in a weekend. ‘Oppenheimer’ is one of them!”“Oppenheimer” lead star Murphy revealed earlier this year that he had been waiting to lead a Nolan film after collaborating with the director on a slew of features including the “Dark Knight” trilogy.“I have always said publicly and privately, to Chris, that if I’m available and you want me to be in a movie, I’m there,” Murphy said. “I don’t really care about the size of the part. But deep down, secretly, I was desperate to play a lead for him.”He added, “You realize this is a huge responsibility. [J. Robert Oppenheimer] was complicated and contradictory and so iconic. But you know you’re with one of the great directors of all time. I felt confident going into it with Chris. He’s had a profound impact on my life, creatively and professionally. He’s offered me very interesting roles over and I’ve found all of them really challenging. And I just love being on his sets.”For all the details on “Oppenheimer,” click here.",

        "content": "Angela Bassett is reminding the world that love has everything to do with it.The two-time Oscar nominee, who earned her first Academy nomination for portraying Tina Turner in the biopic “What’s Love Got to Do with It,” detailed the final words late rock icon Turner told her during the 1993 film. Laurence Fishburne portrayed Turner’s former husband and collaborator, Ike Turner.The “River Deep, Mountain High” singer died May 24 at age 83 after suffering from a long illness.“How do we say farewell to a woman who owned her pain and trauma and used it as a means to help change the world?,” Bassett said in a statement (via The Hollywood Reporter). “Through her courage in telling her story, her commitment to stay the course in her life, no matter the sacrifice, and her determination to carve out a space in rock and roll for herself and for others who look like her, Tina Turner showed others who lived in fear what a beautiful future filled with love, compassion, and freedom should look like.”Bassett continued, “Her final words to me — for me — were, ‘You never mimicked me. Instead, you reached deep into your soul, found your inner Tina, and showed her to the world.’ I shall hold these words close to my heart for the rest of my days. I am honored to have known Tina Turner. I am humbled to have helped show her to the world.”The “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” star added, “So on today, while we mourn the loss of this iconic voice and presence, she gave us more than we could have ever asked. She gave us her whole self. And Tina Turner is a gift that will always be ‘simply the best.’ Angels, sing thee to thy rest…Queen.”Turner won eight Grammy Awards across her more than half-century-long career.Bassett previously recalled the physical and emotional toll of transforming into Turner for the biopic film.“We would do scenes over and over and over again,” Bassett said in 2022 of singing in character. “Those concert scenes, literally you feel like you have a sweater in your throat after performing, and we would do it [again] from top to bottom.”The film captured the years of physical abuse Ike inflicted upon Tina; both Bassett and Fishburne received Oscar nominations for their performances.",

        "title": "Tina Turner Dead at 83: One of the Most Cinematic of All Music Icons",
        "content": "“The Best” has left us.Tina Turner, the Queen of Rock ‘n Roll, is dead at age 83 after suffering from a long illness. Turner passed away at her home in Küsnacht, outside Zurich, Switzerland.“With her, the world loses a music legend and a role model,” Turner’s spokesperson Bernard Doherty said in a statement.Turner began her career with husband Ike Turner’s Kings of Rhythm in 1957 and performed under stage name Little Ann before debuting as Tina Turner in 1960 with single “A Fool in Love.” Tina and Ike Turner collaborated on hits “River Deep, Mountain High,” “It’s Gonna Work Out Fine,” and “Proud Mary” before disbanding in 1976.Turner went on to launch a career comeback with 1984 hit song “What’s Love Got to Do With It,” which won the Grammy for Record of the Year. The track lent its title to a 1993 biopic adapted from Turner’s autobiography “I, Tina: My Life Story.” Angela Bassett played the role of Turner in the film; Laurence Fishburne was cast as Ike Turner, and the film vividly conveyed the years of physical abuse Ike inflicted upon Tina.“We would do scenes over and over and over again,” Bassett recalled in 2022 of singing in character. “Those concert scenes, literally you feel like you have a sweater in your throat after performing, and we would do it [again] from top to bottom.”Both Bassett and Fishburne received Oscar acting nominations for their roles.Turner appeared in films “Tommy,” “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,” and “Last Action Hero.” She formally retired after completing her Tina!: 50th Anniversary Tour in 2009. By 2018, Turner’s life story was turned into Broadway musical “Tina,” which also was the title for an HBO documentary directed by Dan Lindsay and T.J. Martin. The documentary film debuted in 2021.Of course her voice is instantly identifiable in a way reserved for only a few artists.Powerful and with a bit of twang, on songs like “River Deep, Mountain High” it felt like she could move the earth itself, as if it was exploding out of your speakers. Hers was a voice that could rise above Phil Spector’s wall of sound on “River Deep” and command it, a vocalist who also felt like a conductor.And beyond those pipes, there were those moves. It’s become established lore by now that those “Moves Like Jagger” were really the “Moves Like Turner.” In a bit of contained kineticism, she invented the stiff-shoulder boogie-down grooves that Mick Jagger has displayed at arenas all over the world. Friends with the Stones since the ’60s, Tina and Ike had performed with them (and Tina even appears briefly in the “Gimme Shelter” documentary). She had all it took to be a solo pop star in her own right. But it took leaving Ike and a relentless work ethic to break through and do something almost impossible: become that pop star in her mid-40s.For real, who becomes a pop star with number-one records and sold-out arenas in their mid-40s? After they’ve already been in the music business for decades? Tina Turner did. Her 1984 album for Capitol Records, “Private Dancer,” brought ’60s craft and bombast to ’80s pop. (It was a move Turner’s contemporary Aretha Franklin copied a year later with her own electropop album “Who’s Zoomin’ Who?”) The album spawned seven singles, including “What’s Love Got to Do With It” and a rendition of the Beatles’ “Help!” that will pierce you to the bone.Her movie work reflected her shift in popularity. When playing the Acid Queen in Ken Russell’s “Tommy” in 1975, it played off her status as a kind of cult figure, revered for her artistry but eccentric in the way a truly mainstream celebrity usually can’t be. A decade later and on top of the world she’s the co-lead with Mel Gibson in “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,” rocking a spiky ’80s wig, driving a hotrod across the apocalyptic landscape, and oozing more than a bit of sexual menace for the film’s hero — she is the villain of the piece. But she still brings an oddball quality to that performance even if in a blockbuster mold.Turner was made for the movies. It’s a shame she didn’t do more. Her voice is essential to power the “GoldenEye” theme song that kicks off Pierce Brosnan’s Bond era, hinting at all kinds of promised lustiness for the post-Cold War world. “See reflections in the water / more than darkness in the depths,” she purrs, and it’s like a musical expression of the idea that the fall of communism is hot.Which is all to say that she defiantly resisted the notion that she should be thought of as an abuse victim, first and foremost, as the media furor around her comeback, her memoir, and then the “What’s Love Got to Do with It” movie tried to convey. Even in the 2021 “Tina” doc she resists talking too much about Ike’s abuse and implies that people wanting to talk about it endlessly was a form of re-abusing her.Turner needn’t have worried, even if she was dead-on about some of the media obsession with her. She was an irreducibly complex figure. Someone who could never be defined by one thing. And as the years wore on, and she retreated from public life to her home in Switzerland, it seemed she recognized that Tina Turner had gotten so big as an idea, she didn’t need to actively fan the flames of her fame.Even before death, Tina Turner had transcended her corporeal life to be an idea, a legend, a rumor that was immortal.",

        "title": "‘The Mother of All Lies’ Review: A Handmade Tale About Shocking Buried Secrets",
        "content": "While photographs can be lies and we’re probably all taking and distributing too many pictures of ourselves in the age of smartphones, there’s something to be said for having these accessible mementos of a life lived, at least as reference for later on, when you might be clamoring for proof that you actually existed. And while audio-visual evidence isn’t necessary for us to remember everything, there can be an extent to which an absence of documentation can prove an existential burden. It can be difficult to build an identity when your memories are unreliable. If you have no visual record of you as a child, your parents, or guardians at that time, or what your home looked like, to what extent can you trust what you think you remember?This is one of the central ideas driving Moroccan filmmaker Asmae El Moudir’s riveting, inventive Un Certain Regard entry “The Mother of All Lies.” Her film starts with the desire to know why she has only one photograph from her childhood, and why the girl presented in the image seems to be so different from her. From that starting point, she reaches a point of recreating her family’s home and neighborhood in miniature form, as means of interrogating both personal and national history.Given the exploration of a country’s trauma through the use of diorama models, “The Mother of All Lies” will inevitably draw some comparisons to “The Missing Picture” (2013), Rithy Panh’s film that recreated the atrocities of Cambodia’s Khmer Rouge. It’s a considerably different film, as that film was able to use a solid amount of archival footage, which “The Mother of All Lies,” as part of its very setup, is not able to do at all.As an adult, El Moudir has been troubled by a matter concerning her childhood, specifically that she has only ever had one photograph of herself as a child. She’s never been convinced it’s actually her. The photo is of smiling children sitting in a yard. At the back in the photograph, almost out of frame, a shy-seeming little girl can be seen sitting on a bench. This shy girl is El Moudir, insists her mother, who first gave her daughter the photo around age 12, following envy at the wealth of holiday photos shown to El Moudir by a childhood friend.This perceived lie was a key conflict with her mother during her teenage years. While her mother would still insist that it really is her in the photo, El Moudir managed to pressure an explanation out of her regarding why it’s apparently the only picture of her pre-teen years: under the pretext of it being forbidden by their religion, El Moudir’s grandmother — the stern head of the family — refused to have any human representation within her house. Hence, no photographs.When her parents are in the process of moving out of the Casablanca house they’d lived in throughout her life (with the grandmother), the opportunity arises for El Moudir to dig deeper into other buried truths from the home’s history. The matter of the photograph is used as a catalyst by the filmmaker to bring up other memories or stories she’s treated with suspicion. Sure enough, the reason for her grandmother’s rejection of photography runs much deeper than the reason previously cited. And unsurprisingly, the matriarch is a reluctant subject for a documentary, though she is ultimately onscreen for a considerable amount of “The Mother of All Lies,” albeit while often gazing into the camera with visible disdain. At one point, she repeatedly rejects El Moudir calling herself a filmmaker, instead insisting she’s a journalist; there’s a suggestion that such a job title might be why she agrees to any participation in the project at all.Another photograph also drives El Moudir’s documentary to go beyond just family secrets, in order to also probe buried memories of her country: that of Fatima, a local girl who died on June 20, 1981, amidst a national strike during the Bread Riots revolt that was driven by price increases in basic food supplies. Although her body was never recovered, thanks to the covering up of military and police activity in their neighborhood that day, a nearby cemetery — close to the director’s family’s home — has been inaugurated in order to honor the victims.Watching a news report about the inauguration, El Moudir is particularly moved by the portrait of Fatima held by a female relative. She died in 1981 — at the same age as when El Moudir wanted a photo of herself — on the same streets where the filmmaker would play as a 12-year-old in the 1990s. The idea behind victims’ bodies, like that of Fatima, being taken away was to erase, as quickly as possible, any trace of the riots, so as to terminate the broadcast of any information contradicting the official line. According to unions, there were more than 600 casualties from that time, though only 66 deaths were officially reported.The filmmaker has a corporeal form, though no document of her childhood, while Fatima’s loved ones have no body but do they have the precious record of her existence in the form of the photograph. “Fatima became a memory with no body,” as the director puts it in her narration, while she herself was “a body with no memories”. Only one photo of the actual horrors of the day of Fatima’s death exists, and it’s not believed that she’s present in it: a black and white picture of dead bodies and abandoned bicycles on a street. All other evidence was destroyed, and bodies removed from the site. And there’s no national archive with anything else for reference.While we see the family’s real house steadily being cleared out, El Moudir collaborates with her father, a mason, at another location where much of the documentary takes place — although his assistance and dedication to the project does not spare him from interrogation that the other family members receive. Within a soundstage, they painstakingly recreate their house and Casablanca neighborhood in the form of a miniature set, from memory, given that they have little to no photographic reference from which to draw. Additional decorators and technicians were enlisted to help bring life and light to the dioramas, and to enhance the detail to make them as realistic as possible, in order to help draw out the best responses from the eventual witnesses to the model sets.The director brings the rest of the household into the space, as well as some neighboring friends and extended family. Throughout the film, they are asked probing questions about long-held stories that are full of holes, or prompted to rationalize their continued silence regarding what they may have seen over the years; why they have intentionally forgotten and whether they now have a better sense of events they experienced with decades of distance.Some of the players brought in also participate in the miniature reconstruction of their own homes or meaningful local spaces. In one memorable sequence, a participant is visibly distressed upon seeing a model version of the prison cell in which he suffered during the 1980s. But there is a suggestion of catharsis through the process, for at least some of the assembled players. And while there is a stylized approach to the wider film, particularly in the way El Moudir’s camera weaves in and out of the model sets, one gets the sense that the emotional reactions from her interviewees are genuinely spontaneous.The extent to which any truths are ultimately unearthed, and the exact nature of them, are obviously best left unspoiled. And while much of the film is built on repressed pain, there are moments of celebration, some reconciliation, and even laughter. In some cases, there is comedy with tragedy. You’ll probably feel bad for El Moudir’s artist friend who’s brought into the soundstage one day to produce a glass portrait of the grouchy grandmother, knowing all too well that she’s probably going to hate the end result. But the extent to which the old woman thoroughly — and almost immediately — demolishes the portrait with her walking stick is truly something to behold, just like this film.“The Mother of All Lies” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "title": "‘The Feeling That the Time for Doing Something Has Passed’ Review: A Young Woman Seeks Debasement",
        "content": "[Editor’s Note: This review was originally published during the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Magnolia Pictures will release the film in U.S. theaters April 26.]“I love that you never do anything for me…it’s like I don’t even exist.”That’s what Ann, a depressed thirty-something New Yorker, tells her older on-and-off BDSM lover in the first scene of writer-director Joanna Arnow’s “The Feeling That the Time for Doing Something Has Passed,” in which the filmmaker also stars as Ann. Her heroine is an existentially moribund millennial wasting away in an anonymous-feeling corporate job who passes her time with sexual debasement when not quarreling with her nagging Jewish family.This clever and disquieting indie unfolds at a clip somnambulant enough to match its lead’s spiritual stupor, whether she’s spreading her ass for her partners (clients?) or on the phone with her needling mother insisting that, no, she isn’t running out of breath despite trudging up and down the Manhattan streets. (She very much is, and running in place within her life.) Kneejerking viewers might draw a cross between Miranda July mumblecore and Lena Dunham unfilteredness here in terms of Arnow’s willingness to degrade herself on camera, but that’s a comparison the filmmaker would probably be annoyed over and one that elides the movie’s uniquely droll vibe.Ann is bored of contemporary life, and she’s been sleepwalking through it. She’s been at her sterile corporate gig for “three and a half years,” she claims, to little notice of her employers, who hand her a trophy declaring congratulations for her one-year anniversary. It’s not clear what she does at her desk job, or what it even is, but that matters about as much to us as it does to Ann. There is, at one point, a restructuring and a title change (“clinical media learning e-specialist,” whatever the hell that means), but Ann saves the real adventures of her life for a private parallel sexual universe in which she performs as a “sub” for dominating men. There’s finance guy Allen (Scott Cohen), fuckboy film composer Thomas (Peter Vack), emotionally inaccessible Elliot (Parish Bradley), and, eventually, Chris (Babak Tafti), with whom she may finally approximate something toward love. But how much of a performance is it if Ann is actually pretty into the whole arrangement?In between seeking derangements, she lives alone in a Brooklyn apartment, eating microwaved meals squeezed out of bags, that’s eventually crashed by her sister (Alysia Reiner), whose life is falling apart. But as with Ann’s trysts, this is but one in a series of vignettes that the screenplay loosely strings together — there’s not so much of a story as a kind of languorous rhythm the movie unfolds to, with long, single takes framed at a distance almost as if Joanna Arnow is surveilling her own self vis-a-vis this character. The editing (which Arnow also does herself) picks up once Ann’s life starts to become too mundane with its routine: go to work, have debasing sex, go to sleep, maybe go to yoga, and repeat.Arnow is totally willing to sink herself to the lowest of lows onscreen as when, in one sequence, Elliot turns Ann into a “fuck pig,” dressing her up with ball gag, swine ears, and all, and demands she masturbate on his city rooftop. Some of Ann’s encounters are more interesting than others; Vack is little-used as the composer who, after having enjoyed many blowjobs, tells Ann he’s getting back together with his ex-girlfriend, who doesn’t want him to see other “subs.” Ann briefly bonds with him over her love for the soundtrack to “In the Act of Wishing for Love,” a funny malapropism for “In the Mood for Love” that also might as well be wishful thinking on Ann’s end. That she gets the title to her own favorite movie score wrong suggests Ann is just ever so off-kilter from the world, but also maybe just walks to fuck with it, too.Among her indie credits, Arnow previously directed the 2013 film “I hate myself :)” about a self-proclaimed nebbish documentary filmmaker during a year in the life of her toxic relationship. That title, when stacked up against “The Feeling That the Time for Doing Something Has Passed,” suggests that Arnow has now learned a little along the way. Ann doesn’t hate herself, she doesn’t ever self-destruct or try to. She’s just going through life.There is undoubtedly a level of autofiction going on here on Arnow’s part as she uses the mosaic structure of a series of BDSM encounters to interrogate the alienating aspects of millennial life. (One of the film’s relatably hilarious moments that targets a very specific Gen Y angst comes when Ann goes on a family vacation, and her mom is stunned she has to work remotely throughout the trip.) It’s also clear that Arnow wants to present a picture of a woman in a BDSM relationship who has agency and ownership of the situation rather than as a passive participant. “The Feeling That the Time for Doing Something Has Passed” lacks for drama in its portrayal of the quotidian realities of sexual kink, but Arnow’s voice is distinctive, shrewd, and spiky enough to keep it afloat.“The Feeling That the Time for Doing Something Has Passed” premiered in the Directors’ Fortnight section of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.

        "title": "‘Inside the Yellow Cocoon Shell’ Review: A Hypnotizing Vietnamese Drama Goes on a Quest for Transcendence",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Kino Lorber releases the film in theaters on Friday, January 19.An intimate three-hour epic of deliberate pacing, Vietnamese writer-director Thien An Pham’s debut feature, “Inside the Yellow Cocoon Shell,” is a spellbinding tale of the soul’s unfathomable desire for the other-worldly, that does itself border on transcendental in its filmmaking and gradual blurring of apparent truth and suggested fantasy.The film premiered in the Cannes’ Directors’ Fortnight section, where the filmmaker was previously recipient of the Illy Prize in 2019 for the short “Stay Awake, Be Ready,” in which a roadside accident at a street corner interrupted a conversation between three friends having a meal. That short seems loosely remade for the new feature’s opening scene, which expands the idea to explore a man’s attempted overcoming of a deeply unsatisfied life, taking him from urban Saigon to the hinterland of Vietnam, out of both familial necessity and a quest to make sense of where and how to proceed with his life going forward.“Inside the Yellow Cocoon Shell” opens on a static shot of someone in a mascot costume lingering outside of where a football (soccer) game is taking place in Saigon. The camera then tracks this brief subject of our focus to an outdoor bar to the side of the grounds, where three sitting companions turn down the costumed figure’s attempts at engagement. One of the men expresses considerable skepticism concerning his friend’s discussion of his faith and the ease with which he’s able to believe in a higher power. The third man of the group, the film’s thirtysomething protagonist Thien (Le Phong Vu), eventually chimes in with his thoughts when prompted: “The embrace of faith is ambiguous… I want to believe but I can’t. I’ve tried searching for it many times, but my mind always holds me back.”Thien’s about to be nudged towards properly grappling with notions of fate and the spiritual, though he has a delayed response to engaging with the information that will set this in motion. Approximately five minutes into the film’s running time, Thien and his friends’ discussion is interrupted by the sound of a nearby collision. Just beyond the outdoor bar’s premises, a crash between two motorcycles has taken place. Suggesting both general apathy and such accidents being commonplace, nearby observers are slow to actually approach the three injured or potentially dead bodies strewn on the road, while Thien is among those who just stay put in their seat.Cut to Thien and friends at a spa later that night, where he repeatedly ignores phone calls. When in a room for a private back massage, the masseuse asks if he’s afraid to pick up his vibrating cell phone because it might be his girlfriend, to which he responds that “God is calling,” then referring to the deity as his “client.” Shortly after, the masseuse takes a cue from his sardonic comments when he looks to be adjusting his position while lying on his stomach. “Is God stuck? Let me help you,” she says, before reaching for his crotch for suggested tugging of that area’s contents.It’s during this moment that Thien is finally forced to deal with the freak occurrence that propels his journey going forward, as another spa employee enters and interrupts to say that one of Thien’s friends insists he absolutely needs to answer his phone immediately. It turns out his sister-in-law, Hanh, was killed in the earlier motorcycle accident that Thien ignored, while his five-year-old nephew, Dhao (Nguyen Thinh), was (miraculously) largely unharmed despite also being thrown from his mother’s vehicle.Thien, who works in Saigon as a video editor and has been fairly estranged from his family, is now Dhao’s only living relative there, and so he goes to the hospital to meet the boy and take care of all necessary procedures in order to transport Hanh’s body back to their hometown. Within the purse among her recovered belongings is a picture of Hanh with Thien’s older brother, Tam, who vanished years ago. There are differing stories regarding Tam’s absence scattered across the film. One is that he left his wife and son for another woman. Another is that he may have found a spiritual calling that required abandoning his family with no explanation. Either way, Dhao now needs a guardian, whether it’s his real father or not.Traveling across Vietnam to his former countryside hometown, Thien is present for the Christian funeral for Hanh. The proceedings, which include processions at both night and in daylight, are seemingly staggered over a number of days, with Thien sticking around for roughly a week to pray for her soul with relatives, including Hanh’s brother, Trung (Vu Ngoc Manh). He spends time with Dhao too, who at one point asks him what “faith” means. For the child, the agnostic man compares faith to being sure that a friend will return a toy which you have let them borrow.Pham and his DOP, Dinh Duy Hung, favor long takes throughout the film. While some of these are static and wide angle, many gradually morph within a given sequence playing out in real-time; following a character elsewhere outside of the initial viewpoint, accompanying them on a journey to another destination before they and the camera then stay still for another little while. Never coming across like a spinning of wheels, the leisurely rhythms serve to let the images, accompanying sounds and natural serenity of the landscapes, farmlands, and city and village spaces — largely shot in natural light — become more deeply absorbed by the viewer.It’s the kind of film that steadily trains you in perceiving and eventually becoming lost in its sense of time, to the extent that you can almost forget the presence of the camera even when it is moving. You’re living in the frame with Thien; the timing of the camera and character naturally intertwined.Thien ultimately settles on a plan to search for his missing older brother, though before his mystical pilgrimage begins, there’s something of a road movie quality even to the scenes within the hometown’s borders. The film’s showiest sustained take begins with a long-held static shot lasting several minutes, as an outdoor conversation with Trung takes place, with the camera then following behind Thien and Dhao as they slowly journey on a motorcycle further into town, to pass on payment, on behalf of Trung, to a man who provided a burial shroud for Hanh.Once they arrive, the camera stays put outside a house without any apparent cuts, as Thien enters the home of the old man, Mr. Luu, and has a long conversation that turns into discussion of Mr. Luu’s memories of military service, injuries, police work, and how he decided to dedicate the remainder of his life to shrouding the deceased. With the conversation starting by an open window, the camera almost imperceptibly moves closer and closer from outside and into the kitchen space within the house. By the time there’s finally a clear cut, it’s been nearly 25 minutes since the sequence began with Thien talking to Trung in a different part of town. That Mr. Luu is reportedly a non-professional actor and real local of the area, regaling stories of his own life (though rehearsed so as to avoid any incoherent tangents), makes the magic trick of the lengthy sequence even more impressive.Thien has many more meaningful encounters on the road, but it’s a specific reconnection with his painful past that’s the basis for the film’s most beautifully moving sequence, wherein the film’s flirtations with the surreal escape the confines of more explicitly designated dream sequences. Stopping off at an abandoned building and heading to the roof, Thien seem to be getting followed by a mysterious, barefoot young woman glimpsed through window spaces to the side of the frame. Up on the roof, he suddenly engages in conversation with the figure who’s approached.It’s Sister Thao (Nguyen Thi Truc Quynh), a nun introduced earlier, who was once Thien’s girlfriend in the time before he moved to Saigon for work. The conversation they engage in on this puddle-populated rooftop is one they had many years earlier, but this is not a flashback in the traditional sense. While Thao is (initially) bubblier and styled so as to code her as her younger self, before she gave herself to God, Thien looks the same as he has for the rest of the film, and is wearing the same clothes he will continue to travel in beyond this scene. His memory of this event is represented by two timelines intertwined within the same physical space; she looks as he remembers when this conversation happened years ago (a ghost Thien can still touch and kiss), while he is how he currently is in the present timeline.Thien’s reunion with a lost love apparently able to resolve her once consistent malaise through faith is one of several key explorations of divine calling throughout the film. And connecting with the movie, getting on its wavelength, is not reliant on one having had their own direct experiences with religious faith from which to draw. Whether or not you’ve ever believed in a higher power, we’ve all questioned who we are, what we’re living for, and how to escape a certain mundanity in which modern society can box us. Based on the quality of his debut feature, Pham has certainly found his own divine calling with filmmaking.“Inside the Yellow Cocoon Shell” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.",

        "content": "Greta Gerwig found a muse in Barbie before signing on to write and direct the Warner Bros. film, produced by lead star Margot Robbie.Oscar nominee Gerwig penned a poem inspired by Apostle’s ‘Creed’ in addition to a treatment with partner Noah Baumbach to land the project, Robbie revealed in a Vogue cover story.“Greta wrote an abstract poem about Barbie,” Robbie said. “And when I say ‘abstract,’ I mean it was super abstract.”“Little Women” director Gerwig only added that the poem “shares some similarities with the Apostles’ ‘Creed,'” and no one from Mattel, Robbie’s LuckyChap production banner, or Warner Bros. read any part of the script until it was completed.Robbie noted that it was important for Gerwig and co-writer Baumbach to have complete creative freedom when crafting the “genius” script for “Barbie,” yet, “At the same time, we’ve got two very nervous ginormous companies, Warner Bros. and Mattel, being like: ‘What’s their plan? What are they going to do? What’s it gonna be about? What’s she going to say?’ They have a bazillion questions.”Robbie ensured that LuckyChap structured the deal so Gerwig and Baumbach could have an “open” creative process, “which is really fucking hard to do.” The “I, Tonya” actress added that Gerwig was “on that list for a long time” of directors she had been eyeing to work with in her career.Writer-director Gerwig called the process of penning the script with Baumbach “literally imaginative play.” The film was inspired by old Technicolor musicals, with the cast screening films like “The Red Shoes” and “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg” as part of “movie church” during production.“They have such a high level of what we came to call authentic artificiality,” Gerwig said of what led to the “Techni-Barbie” aesthetic of the film. “You have a painted sky in a soundstage. Which is an illusion, but it’s also really there. The painted backdrop is really there. The tangibility of the artifice is something that we kept going back to.”Robbie added of reading the script, “We just looked at each other, pure panic on our faces. We were like, ‘Holy fucking shit.’ I think the first thing I said to Tom was, ‘This is so genius. It is such a shame that we’re never going to be able to make this movie.'”For all the details on “Barbie,” in theaters July 21, click here.",

        "title": "‘Fallen Leaves’ Review: Aki Kaurismäki’s Lovely Ode to Movies Finds Light in the Darkness of Modern Life",
        "content": "To judge by Aki Kaurismäki’s typically wry and winsome “Fallen Leaves,” the Finnish auteur’s first movie since threatening to retire after “The Other Side of Hope” came out 2017, only two things have any significant importance have happened in the world over the last six years. The first and most pressing of those is the war in Ukraine, which bleeds into Ansa’s (Alma Pöysti) already depressing kitchen every time the supermarket cashier dares to turn on her radio after work. Listening to news of the latest atrocity in Kyiv is the only thing worse than eating her microwaved dinner in the complete silence Ansa settles for when she can’t find anything more comforting on the airwaves. She doesn’t need any further evidence of the darkness outside her window, thank you very much.The other major historical milestone since 2017 was obviously the release of Jim Jarmusch’s “The Dead Don’t Die,” which Ansa and the hangdog alcoholic she picked up at the local bus station (Jussi Vatanen as the deader than deadpan Holappa) see on the first date of the fumbling courtship that will come to define Kaurismäki’s feather-light tragicomedy. “I’ve never laughed so much,” one of them says as they walk out of the reperatory theater. Odds are that Kaurismäki means all of this as a loving nod to his most simpatico of all American filmmakers, but “Fallen Leaves” viewers who’ve seen Jarmusch’s misbegotten zom-com for themselves will probably have a very different takeaway: Ansa and Holappa’s lives must be really fucking grim.They are (to a degree), but as tends to be the case in Kaurismäki’s films, their lives are also never quite as bleak as they seem. There are exceptions to that rule across the director’s body of work, and the fact that “Fallen Leaves” is amusingly billed as the “lost” fourth film in his Proletarian Trilogy — which ended on an uncharacteristically bleak note with 1990’s “The Match-Factory Girl” — would seem cause for concern that things between Ansa and Holappa might not work out so well. Indeed, she gets fired from the supermarket for stealing expired food, and he struggles to stay sober long enough to get through an entire shift at the construction site where he works with his friend, Houtari (Kaurismäki veteran Janne Hyytiäinen, wonderful here as a wannabe lothario who possesses a divine confidence in his karaoke skills). But hope, much like “Fallen Leaves” itself, is only ever believed to be lost, and happiness is never far at hand. While Ansa may not be able to stomach the news from Ukraine that she hears on the radio, the perspective that such awfulness shines on her own misfortunes proves invaluable. An 81-minute film that’s as crisp and bittersweet as a late autumn breeze, Kaurismäki’s latest might amount to little more than a bauble in the end, but it offers a stirring reminder — both with its story, and through the experience of watching it — that life can only be so bleak so long as you can still go to the movies and escape it for a little while.The joys on display here are slight but plentiful, and on nearly constant display. As is always the case with Kaurismäki’s films, they start with the cinematography of Timo Salminen, whose chiaroscuro lighting and dusky blue shadows tease rare poetry from even the dimmest of lives. It’s hard to imagine anything sadder than the dingy karaoke bar in which a middle-aged man belts out Schubert’s “Serenade” — with live-accompaniment! — for an audience of day laborers on their sixth beers of the night, but Salminen’s camera renders the half-empty room into a romantic commentary on the human condition. The loneliness in the air becomes almost as thick and visible as the cigarette smoke (no small feat in what might be the smokiest movie this side of “Backdraft”), articulately spelling out Ansa and Holappa’s mutual state of mind long before they even say a word to each other. This being a Kaurismäki film, those words will be few and far between. “Tough guys don’t sing,” Holappa tells his friend, his face betraying all the emotion of a ventriloquist. They don’t seem to talk a lot either. But it doesn’t matter, he and Ansa are bound together by the unspoken belief that their lives are unworthy of love, and by the time we see that Ansa has to buy a second plate just so that she can invite Holappa over for dinner, it’s clear that these two fortysomethings had given up on happiness before they found a kindred spirit. There’s a joy in watching Holappa’s stoic face start to loosen around the edges, just as there’s a joy in watching him screw things up a few times over. Shot with Bressonian simplicity, the scene in which he loses Ansa’s number — by literally dropping the piece of paper on which she wrote it — might seem too absurd in a different kind of film, but this one finds a knowing comfort in its basic narrative beats. Holappa just waits outside of the movie theater every night until Ansa shows up again, searching for scraps of the happiness she enjoyed there on their first date.Such Chaplin-esque logic makes perfect sense inside the snow globe universe of a Kaurismäki film, where time stands still even as it leaves the characters behind. The world has gone online, but the local bar relies on a rainbow-colored Wurlitzer that plays a Finnish-language cover of “Mambo Italiano.” Google exists in “Fallen Leaves,” but Ansa can only afford to use the laptop at her local café for 28 minutes. Later, in a very different context, Holappa will give voice to what Ansa must have felt in that moment: “I have the time, but not the money.” Kaurismäki needs precious little of either. A lucid and brittle ode to the little beauties of life that can be easy to lose sight of without the benefit of seeing them on the big screen, “Fallen Leaves” may be endowed with the spirit of a fable and the romantic sweep of a Sirkian melodrama, but its faith in our ability to find light in the darkness never feels the least bit false or naive, because to watch this movie is to find it there too. “Fallen Leaves” premiered in Competition at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "content": "Wes Anderson is thanking his lucky stars for COVID protocols overlapping with the “Asteroid City” production.The auteur, whose science-filled out-of-this-world film debuted at 2023 Cannes, credited the global pandemic for inspiring the quarantine plotline in his latest script.“During the intense part of the COVID period, we were writing the script. I don’t think there would be a quarantine in the story if we weren’t experiencing it,” Anderson said. “It wasn’t deliberate. Writing is the most improvisational part of the whole process.”The subsequent pandemic protocols on the “Asteroid City” set in Spain also grounded the ensemble feature. The film was shot between August and October 2021.“The making of the movie during COVID protocols, it really suited us. It worked for us,” Anderson added. “I loved that we formed a troupe and stayed together and sat at a long table and had dinner.”The “troupe” consisted of the star-studded cast including Scarlett Johansson, Bryan Cranston, Maya Hawke, Liev Schreiber, Jeff Goldblum, Rita Wilson, Tom Hanks, Steve Carell, Margot Robbie, Tilda Swinton, Ed Norton, and Adrien Brody. “The French Dispatch” returning actors Willem Dafoe, Jeffrey Wright, and Fisher Stevens additionally appear, along with Anderson staple Jason Schwartzman.“Asteroid City” is set in a fictional American desert town circa 1955 during its Junior Stargazer convention, with students and parents from across the country traveling for scholarly competition, rest and recreation, comedy, drama, romance, and more. Director Anderson co-wrote the screenplay with Roman Coppola, who is credited with a “story by” for “The French Dispatch” and “Isle of Dogs.” The “Mozart in the Jungle” creator also penned “Moonrise Kingdom” and “The Darjeeling Limited” with Anderson.IndieWire critic David Ehrlich called “Asteroid City” Anderson’s “best effort since ‘The Grand Budapest Hotel'” and noted that the titular town at the heart of the plot is “as vibrant and elaborate a location as Anderson has ever conceived.”“It’s maybe the most radical thing that has ever happened in one of his movies — the sort of transformative moment that A.I. could never dream up no matter how much data it ingested — and it spins ‘Asteroid City’ in a cosmic new direction,” Ehrlich wrote. “What until then was just another immaculate Wes Anderson film suddenly becomes one of a kind.”Additional reporting by Eric Kohn.",

        "title": "‘The Little Mermaid’: Director Rob Marshall and Star Halle Bailey Break Down the Live-Action Film’s Surprising Changes",
        "content": "[Editor’s note: The following interview contains some spoilers for “The Little Mermaid.”]When “The Little Mermaid” filmmaker Rob Marshall thinks about his remake of the beloved 1989 Disney animated original, he’s clear: It is its own thing.“It’s so funny how people hold onto things,” Marshall said in a recent interview with IndieWire. “They don’t realize that this is a different genre. You have to make it work as a live-action [film] as if there were never an animated film. It’s your chance to do things that work for the story. It’s all about story. It’s like taking a beautiful opera, a beautiful play, and doing it again. You look at it through a new lens. It’s not 1989, it’s 2023, so what can we bring to it and still hold on to the most important things that really still work, but then kind of reimagine it?”For Marshall’s ambitious live-action take on the story — one that has been told plenty of times since Hans Christian Andersen first wrote his fairy tale back in the 19th century — Marshall and screenwriter David Magee stuck pretty closely to Ron Clements and John Musker’s animated gem, but also peppered their feature with a slew of new additions and tweaks to tell this tale through a new lens.Ahead, Marshall, plus stars Halle Bailey and Jonah Hauer-King, walk IndieWire through some of the bigger changes in their live-action offering, from leaning into the original Andersen fairy tale, piling on new songs to help round out characters, and yes, why Scuttle is no longer a seagull.Marshall’s film opens on a more adult note than its animated predecessor, kicking off with an epigraph attributed to “Little Mermaid” author Hans Christian Andersen’s original (and decidedly more downbeat) 1837 fairy tale: “But a mermaid has no tears, and therefore she suffers so much more.” For Marshall, using that line was all about setting an early expectation of the themes of his live-action version of the classic tale. “Personally, I went back right away to the Hans Christian Andersen tale, that’s where this all came from. I wanted to do a re-imagination of the actual story,” Marshall said. “The opportunity that you have with a live-action film — which is very different than an animated film, it’s a very different genre — is you can bring more scope, more depth, more emotion to the piece.”Marshall saw connections between the more adult-skewing world Andersen crafted for his stories and the one Marshall wanted to build for his live-action tale. And using such a serious line helped bridge the gap between them.“I thought, why are we making this film now?” the director said. “There’s no reason to make this film unless it has something important to say. It was there in the 1800s, 1830s, when it was written, it’s not fearing someone that’s different than you. It’s about tolerance and the passion and what [Ariel] goes through to build that bridge to that other world. I found it very profound, very moving. … I wanted to keep the elements of the piece, but why not give it some more depth?”Star Bailey also felt the resonance of Andersen’s story, a true fish-out-of-water tale with a heartbreaker of an ending, with both Marshall’s film and the beloved 1989 animated version.“I think we all have felt like the outcast in some way, we all resonate with feeling that we want something greater for ourselves, and [Andersen] just did a beautiful job at communicating that in this story,” the newly minted Princess Ariel told IndieWire. “Even with the [animated] version, it’s a lighthearted version of those same concepts, and understanding what it means to be different, and also going after what you want, and not being scared of the other and of our differences. And in our version today, I think both of those elements are included.”Hauer-King, who plays Ariel’s human love Prince Eric, echoed Bailey’s sentiments. “I think it’s really wonderful that we’ve drawn, I think even more, on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale than the 1989 cartoon,” he said. “We could draw on that, we could draw on the original Disney film, and then bring a lot of ourselves to it as well. As Halle said, Andersen’s story is one about outsiders, it’s about people who haven’t been heard, it’s about people who have been on the fringes. … I think we’ve really tried to tap into that.”And Bailey shared that Andersen’s quote offered some foreshadowing when it came to actually filming the feature. Mermaids? They really can’t cry, but their human performers sure can.“’Part of Your World,’ it was a three-day sequence, and it was such an emotional song, and I was very much crying and crying when I was filming it,” Bailey said. “But because we’re underwater, they ended up editing out all of [my] tears that were falling. You want to feel all of those emotions that she’s feeling, but you know that because she’s a mermaid, she can’t really cry in the water. Feeling that pain and emotion and desperation that she has for herself and her future and that she wants to go after was a really cool thing to play.”Beefing up their feature also allowed Marshall and screenwriter Magee to build in a handful of new songs, including one that might surprise audience members, if only because it’s something that should have existed all along: a song for Eric.“We realized, of course, Eric had no song in the original,” Marshall said. “I don’t know anything about him! So it was very obvious we needed to give him an ‘I Want’ song. It’s his ‘Part of Your World.’ And [with it], he becomes a three-dimensional character. It’s a different genre. You’re moving from a 2D piece to a 3D piece with real people.”For Marshall’s film, Alan Menken and Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote “Wild Uncharted Waters,” which Hauer-King’s Prince Eric sings in a moment of tremendous frustration and desire. It’s after he’s been saved by Ariel, and armed with only one piece of knowledge about her (she’s got a great voice), an emotional Eric takes to the beach to express his confusion and wants through song. And, yes, it feels an awful lot like “Part of Your World.”“It’s very clear from the animated film that Eric has very little to do,” Marshall said. “I mean, we don’t understand who he is, what’s his want, what’s his need? And I thought, let’s find out what his journey is. Let’s understand what his trajectory is, and it’s this parallel one to Ariel’s. He doesn’t feel like he fits in, he doesn’t feel [like] people aren’t hearing him. I love that they find each other through their connection in terms of what they want.”Hauer-King didn’t find out about “Wild Uncharted Waters” until he was nearing the end of the audition process for the role, though he knew his Prince Eric would be tasked with singing this time around. “I’d been singing random musical numbers up til that point, and then they presented me with the sheet music,” he said. “I took one look at it and heard it and was just blown away. It made me want to be even more involved with the project because it’s such a special song. Musically, melodically, it’s so wonderful.”And, just like the audience, the song gave the actor the chance to really get to know his character on a deeper level.“We get to know him so well through this song. We understand him so much better. We understand what he’s longing for and what his hopes and his dreams are. And we understand some of his frustration and his pain and longing for this girl that saved him and longing for something bigger,” the actor said. “Obviously, it was sort of terrifying because I knew that meant that I’d be singing next to Halle.”Hauer-King joked, “And that’s a horrible experience, given how exceptional she is. But I just sort of did my best!” (Bailey chimed in, “Jonah did amazing. He killed it. I don’t know what he’s talking about!”)Here’s another song-and-dance surprise: Ariel only has one song in the original animated film. One! “Our lead actor in the piece had one song in the animated film,” Marshall said. “Ariel has ‘Part of Your World’ and the reprise, and that’s it. I thought, that’s insane. She needs another song! I want to understand and hear what she feels specifically when it’s a life-changing moment when she comes on land for the first time, so what a great thing to be able to do that.”To accomplish that end, Menken and Miranda cooked up “For the First Time,” a brand-new song that Ariel “sings” even when she’s lost her voice (it plays out as an internal monologue, a pretty clever way around the curse that Ursula has put on the gentle Ariel in exchange for her temporary legs).“Of course, by that time, she’s lost her voice, but we could use this technique of actually hearing her internal thoughts and song,” Marshall said. “We were also able to use it as a musical concept where you take a song and it wraps around a whole montage, so it takes her from [getting] on land till the moment she meets the prince and past that. It was exciting to actually pull that all together with one big new song for her.”Bailey was thrilled by the addition of the new song, and the star shared that Marshall offered her a surprising inspiration for her performance of it. “He actually had me go back and watch this amazing movie, ‘Yentl,’ that Barbra Streisand directed and starred in, and she was just amazing,” Bailey said. “She had a lot of internal songs where she would be voicing how she feels, but it was all inside, and so you would see her face, but you would hear her voice singing. I went back and I studied that movie, and I got it instantly. I knew exactly what he was talking about, and I just really tried to play every emotion that Ariel had and was feeling on her face during those times.”After a mute Ariel lands in Prince Eric’s kingdom and is kindly taken in by the royal family and their staff, Marshall and Magee wanted the chance to add more texture and dimension to the would-be lovers’ growing bond. Before the pair head out to visit the kingdom (which ends with the iconic “Kiss the Girl” sequence), Ariel and Eric find themselves exploring Eric’s sprawling library, bursting with items he’s gathered during his many seafaring adventures. Ariel, herself a collector and a lover of other cultures, can barely contain her joy over their mutual obsessions.“We created that whole scene in the library where they learn that they’re both interested in other cultures,” Marshall said. “They also want to explore, and they’re adventurous in that way too. So they learn to connect in that way.”“That was actually the first scene we did together,” Bailey said. “We screen-tested that scene together, which was really cool. It’s a really great start to their genuine connection and friendship, because you understand why they gravitate towards one another after seeing Eric’s version of Ariel’s grotto in his library.”Hauer-King is a big fan of the addition, too. “It’s one of my favorite scenes, because I think it really captures their relationship. It really shows us that they’re equals and that they’re fascinated by each other’s worlds,” Hauer-King said. “They’re teaching each other things. He’s telling her about the lands. She shows him this incredible sea stone. You get a sense of their shared humor as well, and I think it really sets up their relationship and sets up their friendship too.”In the film’s third act, Ariel’s wacky pal Scuttle (voiced by Awkwafina) is tasked with delivering some important information to the mermaid and her faithful crab Sebastian (voiced by Daveed Diggs). But, given Scuttle’s inability to accurately communicate, the message gets a bit muddled. Armed with a new song from Menken and Miranda (“The Scuttlebutt”), she at least has a fun time attempting it.“Any time in a film musical [where] you can replace a scene with a song, that’s always the goal,” Marshall said. “Awkwafina is so special, so funny, and so wonderful. I love the character, because it’s hard for the character to put sentences together and [she] makes no sense whatsoever, so thought it’d be so fun to create a patter song. She talks so fast and is always kind of making mistakes, that we thought we could actually put that to song. We thought, well, it makes so much sense to create a patter song, a rap song for Scuttle, because it’s how she speaks anyway.”The result is a zippy, instantly quotable new jam that plays to the strengths of all involved. “It was exciting to create that and bring Daveed into that with her, who’s also an amazing rapper, as we know,” Marshall said. “For me, the goal when I’m creating new music, it has to feel earned. In a musical, when you have someone sing and it doesn’t feel earned, it feels weird, like, why are they singing? It was about making sure that all these songs feel like they’re part of the fabric, should feel earned and seamless to the scene work.”Speaking of Scuttle…while the new look of some of Ariel’s pals has already been widely debated, Marshall was eager to explain why he switched not just the appearance of Scuttle, but her actual species. This time around, Scuttle isn’t a squawking seagull, she’s a diving bird, another kind of seabird known as a gannet.“I wanted to make it that Ariel had never ever been to the surface. Ever,” Marshall said. “That was the goal for me. She’s never broken that rule, [so that helps] raise the stakes for that moment when she finally does it. If she’s up and down, up and down, it’s not a big deal. The fact that she breaks the rule, her father has shut down the surface of the ocean. No one’s ever allowed to go. The mother, his wife, died at the hands of humans. At that moment, he shut down the surface.” So, if Ariel has never even been to the surface, how would she know a seagull? Easy enough: she doesn’t.“After she sings ‘Part of Your World’ and she goes [to the surface] for the first time, it’s so shocking and so thrilling. It’s better storytelling,” Marshall said. “But then I realized, well, Scuttle, how does she know everything that’s up there? We decided to make her a diving bird so that she could come down and Ariel could meet Scuttle in the water and get all that information there, not above.”Marshall and his team considered a variety of diving birds before settling on Scuttle’s new look as a Northern gannet, the largest of its species. And while some fans might balk at the change, it’s a seriously smart one, and one that Marshall knows is essential.“We looked at different ones. There was a cormorant, there was a gannet,” Marshall said. “They stay underwater for many, many minutes and then go back up. We looked at all the different versions of what they looked like. It just seemed so fun and wonderful and it just fit Awkwafina more. We liked it so much more and so I chose to do that, but it’s really important.”Disney releases “The Little Mermaid” in theaters on Friday, May 26.",

        "content": "Fans of the “Fast and the Furious” franchise have grown accustomed to the series’ increasingly elaborate and outrageous set pieces. Given that “F9” climaxed with a scene in which characters literally drove a car into outer space, the pressure was on for “Fast X” director Louis Leterrier and screenwriters Dan Mazeau, Justin Lin, and Zach Dean to open their film with one of the best action sequences yet. The solution: A thrilling chase through the streets of Rome as bad guy Dante (Jason Momoa) sets loose a 10-ton bomb, and Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his team try to maneuver it away from the crowded city. The sequence consists of 554 shots, nearly all of which are a sophisticated combination of stunt driving, practical effects, and computer-generated imagery that are seamlessly blended into perhaps the most spectacular “Fast and Furious” sequence yet.The process of designing the set piece began with the location scout, as Leterrier chose streets in Rome and Turin that would allow him to realize his ambitions. “The practicality of shooting overseas in Rome presents problems,” visual effects supervisor Peter Chiang said. “There’s the delicacy of the architecture and the issue of locking whole streets off for two or three days. As you can imagine, the best streets are the closest to the center of Rome.” Once they secured the necessary permissions from the Italian government, Chiang worked with second unit stunt coordinator Andy Gill and special effects supervisor Alistair Williams to determine what the stunt drivers could do, what effects could be done practically, and which ones would have to be created digitally. “My job is coordinating all of the departments to deliver Louis’ vision of what the sequence should be,” Chiang said. “It’s down to the minutiae: What types of cameras, whether I need a helicopter to shoot plates, what we’re going scan in terms of the Rome streets, shooting array plates for blue screen because only a few actors went to Rome — the rest were in cars against blue screen in London.”Because Letterier wanted to shoot as much of the action practically as possible, the first step was creating an actual bomb that could roll down the streets while figuring out how much would need augmenting with visual effects. “I started to do some animation tests and quickly determined that although the bomb would be useful as a lighting reference and to give everyone an eyeline, the actual movement of the bomb would have to be more sophisticated,” Chiang said. “It would need to bounce on all its individual edges and hit surfaces and spin, and we could never get that physically.” Of equal concern was the fact that the crew had to work within very specific parameters. “We had to leave the location as though no one had been there, so if you look at all the destruction and the trail the bomb leaves on the streets of Rome, damaging the cobblestone, that all had to be visual effects.” Therefore, Chiang and his team scanned all of the streets for moments when the bomb would have to be recreated in post-production.Still, the bomb itself was largely shot practically, with a 2-ton steel model coated in perspex and fiberglass according to production designer Jan Roelfs’ specifications. “When I did the animation tests, I wanted the bomb to be 10 tons,” Chiang said. “That lends itself to a particular type of movement and speed, but there was no way that special effects could make a 10-ton bomb move down a street in Italy with all of this fragile architecture and be controllable.”Obviously, even 2 tons is heavy enough to create difficulties, so Williams and Gill sat down to figure out a way of controlling the bomb. “We put an axle through the big steel ball, and that axle had wires going up to two overhead cables — one going forward, one going back,” Gill said. “And we used a big winch that is designed to tow gliders up into the air with a huge wheel on it, a lot of horsepower. In our testing we were able to get it up to about 35 miles an hour and start and stop it anywhere we wanted. Knowing that we had control, we were able to put the ball in places that we thought weren’t going to be possible. But now that we controlled it, we could drive cars around it, we could jump it, we could do anything we wanted to.”Williams also figured out how to light the bomb on fire, which Chiang found to be helpful even for scenes in which a CG bomb replaced the reference bomb shot on location. “That was great for us, because if the bomb wasn’t spinning but it was moving at the right speed and on fire, we could take the fire off of it and add it onto the CG bomb, and then I wouldn’t have to create CG fire,” Chiang said. Several of Gill’s driving stunts were similar hybrids of practical capture and digital wizardry, though he was able to execute a surprising number of stunts practically with careful planning, including flipping a car into the air with a cannon in the middle of one of those fragile streets. “You put a big steel post inside a car and fire it and it blows the car up into the air,” Gill said. “I know from experience that asphalt, concrete and everything else can’t take the impact without making a big hole in the road, so in order to get them to let us do it I suggested we put a steel trench plate down where we were going to hit the cannon.”In addition to the cars, Dante and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) drive motorcycles in the scene, which created additional complications for Gill — especially since one of the stunts, a 360-degree nose wheelie, was envisioned in a manner never before put on film. Gill’s assistant found a video on YouTube of a rider from Finland who could pull off the stunt, and the final footage of Letty careening through the streets was a combination of that stunt driver and two others. For Gill, finding stunt people close in size to the actors remains essential even in an age of CG slimming. “That’s a lot of time and a lot of money, so I try the best I can to find the right body style and face,” he said. In the case of Momoa, the actor was an expert motorcycle rider who did virtually all of his own driving. “He was a godsend, and he did exactly what we asked him to do — no more and no less.”In order to seamlessly integrate the stunt driving shot in Italy with the blue screen footage of the actors shot in London, Chiang shot the visual effects plates first. “That’s because we knew we could control the lighting of the actors more so than the lighting of the environment,” he said. “For every street that we shot, we always took 360-degree environment spheres of what the action was with a 12-camera rig. Whenever we had a car driving down the middle of a Rome street, we would physically film it, then we would take that car out. The stunt driver that drove it would then get into what we call an array vehicle, which had these 12 cameras, and physically drive down that same street as a take. So therefore, at any time, Louis Leterrier could cut into a shot of the car and see Vin Diesel driving in an environment exactly as though he was driving down the same street.”The complexity and scale of the production and the vagaries of shooting on location in Rome created additional challenges for Gill, as the schedule would sometimes shift and require that cars be shot out of continuity in various stages of destruction. This required his team to be smart about which side of the car could be photographed and led to some clever solutions that offer another example of the blend of practical work and CG that characterize the sequence. “For bullet holes, we would just create stickers and put them on the car, and then those would become CG bullet holes later,” Gill said. “Or on the windshield, we would take a really thin sheet of Lexan that’s cracked or has bullet holes in it and just take it on and pull it off. If you walked up to it you would think it was cracked, you couldn’t tell the difference.” For Gill, working on the “Fast” movies is always as great a pleasure as it is a challenge. “You don’t get to create an action sequence like this very often,” he said. “It’s expensive and it’s time-consuming. The beauty of the ‘Fast’ series is that you get to play with the big toys and implement all the great ideas you’ve always wanted to try.”",

        "title": "Cannes President Iris Knobloch on Streaming Wars, Oscars, Gender Parity, and Much More",
        "content": "Amidst the daily glamor of the Cannes Film Festival red carpet, two faces are fixtures at the top of the staircase. Artistic director Thierry Fremaux has held his perch there for years, greeting filmmakers as they make their way into the Palais des Festivals. This year, however, he got some new company with festival president Iris Knobloch, who stepped into the role previously filled by Pierre Lescure. Fremaux’s new boss is a different kind of Cannes leader than her predecessors, and not only because she’s the first woman to occupy the position in the festival’s 78 years. While Fremaux is a diehard cinephile who runs a film museum in Lyon, Knobloch is a seasoned industry executive with a law degree from NYU who served as the president of operations for WarnerMedia in France for nearly 15 years. (It was during that time that she went to Cannes for the 2011 premiere of “The Artist,” which the studio released in France.) Knobloch has attended Cannes for over 25 years, but her ascension to its presidency injected a sudden new dimension into the many questions facing the future of the festival: How would a businesswoman impact the fate of a cultural event best known for celebrating cinema as an art form? The 60-year-old Knobloch may not know the answer to that question yet, but halfway into the 2023 edition of the festival, she was certain of one thing. “It’s tiresome for all of us,” she told IndieWire from her office on the third floor of the Palais as she sat down for an interview. “Even though I know the festival so well, when you stand on the other side and want to make sure you’re doing the right thing, you put pressure on yourself. It’s interesting when you think you know something, but then you realize you don’t when you’re on the other side.” Knobloch touched on a wide array of issues at the forefront of the Cannes conversation, from its relationship to streaming platforms to gender parity, whether it would program films from Woody Allen or Roman Polanski, and why she values the Oscar race. The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.IndieWire: What did you know about Cannes when you first came in 1998?Iris Knobloch: I grew up in Germany so I admired the festival from afar. Honestly when I was growing up, if you’d told I’d be standing on those stairs, I’d have said, “Yeah, right.” It’s totally surreal, a ridiculous thought. I watched the festival from afar because it was fabulous. I never imagined I could’ve visited. Then I started working for Warners, and that changed the potential opportunity to come. What was your relationship to cinema growing up? I’m a child of Holocaust survivors, so my parents went to the movies almost two times a week, because they didn’t have a youth, so it was a way to recapture those moments. I just tagged along, but it really instilled that kind of knowledge of cinema but also what they taught me through their eyes — that cinema is an important opportunity to get to a broad audience with the right message. You come from the business side of the industry. Cannes is committed to the art form, including the presentation of movies on the big screen, even as the rise of streaming platforms has endangered it. How do you feel about the conflicts between streamers and exhibitors?When I was named president last year, obviously I knew that the streaming question was one of the first matters where I would have to have a strong opinion. That was still during a moment last year where we all didn’t know where this all would be going, and I really didn’t quite know what position I would take. But then after the summer I went to see quite a few of my old friends and colleagues in L.A. It was really interesting for me because I understood that the wind had turned and there was a realization that I really believe in, which is that nothing can replace the cultural moment of a movie coming out in theaters. A movie exists differently when you put it in theaters than when you release it on streaming. I said to the board of Cannes, “Honestly, I salute you, because you’ve been holding up the flag at a moment that wasn’t obvious. I think you did the right thing.” Sometimes you have to stand for your convictions. Do you think the Cannes rule that requires all competition films to have a theatrical release in France will ever change? You know, I think the industry will continue to evolve, the way we make movies will continue to evolve, and the way we distribute movies will continue to evolve. For me, the streaming question is behind us. I wonder what the next kind of evolution will be. I think Cannes should be at the forefront of this evolution. For me, today — as you see with the investments announced by various platforms — it really feels like streaming has taken its place next to cinema but not replacing it, like every time we have a new technology. This year, Todd Haynes’ competition film “May December” was bought by Netflix, so it ended up with a competition film at Cannes after all. I don’t think we should judge that. In this entire debate, what is so important is the public. Many people forget to speak about what the public wants. If you think about that — what does the spectator want? — he wants the choice, the choice to see a film at the movies, on a platform. What that means for release patterns, I don’t have the answer. But we all sometimes forget this when we speak about it. I think this interplay will always exist. I have found often since I came to the festival that there was this wrong perception in the press that Cannes didn’t allow streamers to come. The truth is when you come to Cannes, you don’t need to release in competition. Scorsese didn’t want to be in competition. But most people want it, don’t they?I don’t think that’s true. I was at a studio. What you want is visibility. The truth is, honestly, will people really know if it was in competition? It’s a filmmaker choice. The filmmakers should decide. But Netflix can always submit films to Cannes. They just made a decision not to. Cannes navigates cultural conversations differently than in the U.S. It’s not clear based on anything we’ve heard whether the festival would screen, say, Woody Allen or Roman Polanski films. Where do you fall on those sort of debates?I think the movies selected in Cannes are always a reflection of society. In a way, they invite — directly or indirectly by what they tell and who participates in them — debates that are today’s debates. I think Cannes should be a place to have these debates. It’s OK to disagree. I don’t think Cannes should take the easy way out on these topics, but it should face these debates and have these conversations. I actually think it’s one of the roles of Cannes to not avoid controversy. I also strongly believe that one of the fundamentals of Cannes is the independence of the selection. The selection should look at the quality of the work. The festival stands for cinematographic excellence and that’s what it should look at. And it should stand for the freedom of creation. That may attract controversy and debate, but I think that’s healthy. Fine, but would you be OK with a Woody Allen or Roman Polanski film playing at the festival? They haven’t been presented to us, so I didn’t have to make a decision. [laughs]Hypothetically, then. I think it’s very difficult. It has to be decided on a case by case basis. With these cases, I think it’s very clear to say these fundamentals apply. But there will always be gray areas and you will not make everybody happy. It’s not easy. It’s interesting that the standards on how people view these things are different. What may be OK here is not OK there. People have to accept that. But let’s see. So there’s no firm policy on those directors or others. No, there’s no firm policy, which I find right. I think it’s good. We had this conversation with the board and we felt that every situation is different. In 2018, Fremaux signed a pledge to work towards gender parity at the festival. It’s not there yet. How do you feel about the pressure to program more women directors at the festival, especially in competition?I really feel that the selection committee should look at a movie without thinking about who made it, which country it’s coming from. I really think that’s hugely important. I know that quotas can be helpful, but I also know that quotas are sometimes not easy for women because people may feel they aren’t there for the right reasons. I have lived that in my life. I believe for Cannes, it should always be for the work of art and the rest should have blinders around it.The truth is where I think we and all the festivals should play a role is this: The 33 percent representation of women that we have this year is a reflection of where the industry is. We are at the end of the chain. We have to look at the beginning. We still don’t have enough female filmmakers. They still have more trouble getting financing, more trouble getting entrusted with big projects, and the question I am asking myself now that I’m here is how I can help try and make a difference at the beginning. I think when we start to improve that war, it will be natural to have more women at the end, and it’s still not there. I don’t have the answer yet. I love what our partners do with Women in Motion because women need the spotlight and more confidence in themselves, so whatever we can do to help them is important. We should not start there and not do quotas. Adele Hanele made headlines ahead of this year’s edition by referring to Cannes as a “festival for rapists” that protects abusers. What do you make of that characterization? She has an opinion. I’m not sure I can follow her thinking. I know that Cannes has very high standards on defending what’s right and women. So I find that this is actually getting too much attention. You worked at a major U.S. studio. Why should big American companies value Cannes?I’ve been thinking about that a lot now that I’m on this side. I think that people need human connections and just marketing a movie with a trailer and blasting it out doesn’t create the same human connection that I felt here with Harrison Ford or DiCaprio. It’s not just about visibility. It’s about the human connection that comes with Cannes. I feel that it brings a different life to a movie. If you think about last year with “Top Gun: Maverick,” I mean, there is a different kind of impact that comes with the experience of Cannes that I have not actually felt that much. I feel strongly about that. I think more and more we need that human connection, not just saying two minutes of some footage from a movie.Cannes really presents a springboard for films that I don’t think you can get if you invest the same amount of money in marketing. I must say, it’s important to have all this talent here, but I thought it was great to see Bob Iger and Tim Cook coming for the first time to Cannes. It’s this collective experience of living the moment of a movie that I find a pure theatrical release can never bring. But you have to come with the right movie. Timing and release schedules play a big role, but Scorsese is releasing in October. So if you have the right movie, the release date doesn’t have to matter. Let’s talk about the Oscars. Fremaux has said that they should only award American films Best Picture. You were here in 2011 with “The Artist,” which was not an American production, and it went on to win Best Picture. Where do you fall on this debate?I remember going to the Oscars when “The Artist” won five major Oscars, not Best International Feature Film. I was sitting there and there were such big U.S. filmmakers nominated for Best Director. When the presenter read the category, he had trouble reading “Michel Hazanavicius.” I thought, “Wow, it’s great that the Academy is capable of voting for someone they’ve never met and can’t even pronounce.” So I think Cannes and the Oscars should have no boundaries. I think the only boundaries should be talent. I don’t think geography should play a role. That’s really important in today’s role. “The Artist” — and “Parasite” — would never have had the life it had without Cannes. I lived it. “The Artist” would have been a small success for France without Cannes. Nobody else would’ve seen it. In that case, you think the Best Picture race should start at Cannes?I think it’s the right thing. A work of art should not be judged by countries and boundaries. The Oscars has such worldwide impact. “The Idol” premiered at the festival this year. It’s not the first time TV has played at the festival, but more and more filmmakers are working in that medium. Will Cannes create more space for TV?We already don’t have space! [laughs] No, right now, we have an unwritten policy that we bring from time to time TV from filmmakers who are right for Cannes. There’s nothing wrong with showcasing it sometimes, but movies have to remain clearly identifiable. If you try to be too many things for too many people, the message becomes complicated. At some point you have to make choices and you cannot be everywhere for everyone. This may evolve. We have to be open-minded about where the world is going at the moment. But as of today, I think it’s better to stay clear about who we are and not try to be too many things. This festival is so hard to navigate. No matter who you are, you run into chaos on the streets, problems with access, constant crowds. What can you do to improve this?It’s an ongoing conversation that we are having with the city of Cannes and the mayor because we don’t control these spaces. The city does. Obviously, for them, the festival is really important but you need to find the right solutions. You cannot decide to stop this year to find them because then we wouldn’t have a festival for five years. So you have to find ways to do it each year. I don’t have the answer, but I’m with you on this. We need to have more space. We have to find a smart solution that allows us to create that without impacting the ongoing festival. That’s the challenge.There’s this push and pull that’s very complicated between ensuring security, which is an issue, because security is important but I know it can really be a burden for people who visit. It’s very difficult to find the right balance. This has been something I’ve been watching closely. We have to think about how we manage crowds better, maybe make it more fluid and professional, while being respectful of all the other things. It’s not a challenge, though. It’s an opportunity to create a better experience. The festival circuit has gotten much more competitive in recent years. How do you see Cannes competing with other major European festivals? I really don’t see us as competing with them. I really think that the big festivals — Berlin, Cannes, Venice, Toronto — they have their place, and they insert themselves well into the release patterns for movies. We all play the same important role. We should be there for cinema, giving visibility to smaller movies, which is even more important now because we live in a blockbuster world. I think it’s important that they co-exist. Everyone has their space. We should all be in this together for the greater good, which is cinema and bringing up the new generation.",

My dad was an avid supporter and we’d always go to shows and talks there together. It was a resource for us Ramones, Joan Didion, and Jay-Z-loving Asian Americans growing up to learn more about our own cultural identities,” Awkwafina said during the 2023 Asia Society Southern California Gala (via Variety). “And I think that it’s that kind of self-motivation to curate and cultivate our identities as Asian people, is where cultural vision is born.”She continued, “I want to encourage all of you today — in the case that you are the parents of angsty teenagers trying to figure themselves out, I want you to encourage them to love things, to watch indie movies, to seek out their favorite authors, and to exist in the world in uniquely their own space.”The star of 2019 indie coming-of-age film “The Farewell” added that young Asian Americans will “achieve things more exorbitant than we are shown by being themselves, asking the world, questions and demanding answers from the world.”Awkwafina previously told IndieWire’s Kate Erbland that hiring her as an Asian-American actress is part of a “forward-thinking” approach from Hollywood.“I think that if I am cast in a production, already that means that production is kind of forward-thinking,” the “Ocean’s 8” actress said. “Hiring me is always a risk, a little bit. There will always be roles where you need to be [a certain ethnicity], like it’s relevant to being Asian, it’s relevant to the culture. There are also roles that, when you’re reading a script, ‘Wow, I really can’t be that role because it says that she’s not Asian.’ Now we’re getting into a time where you can read a role that may not even have a gender. I don’t think that that’s a tool of trickery, I think it’s a tool of like, let’s see everyone.”",

        "title": "Quentin Tarantino Expands Rick Dalton’s Backstory: John Carpenter Turned Him Down for ‘The Thing’",
        "content": "Quentin Tarantino is expanding the Rick Dalton lore in the remembrance of the late (and invented) movie star.The “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” auteur announced May 19 that Dalton, played by Leonardo DiCaprio in the 2019 film, died at the age of 90. Dalton’s 1969 exploits alongside stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) were captured in Tarantino’s “Hollywood,” during which Dalton saves Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) from the Manson family would-be serial killers.During Tarantino and “Pulp Fiction” co-screenwriter Roger Avary’s recent entry in the “Video Archives Podcast,” Tarantino remembered the late fictional action star.“Dalton was beloved by fans of ‘Bounty Law,’ where he played bounty hunter Jake Cahill for five seasons and also for his iconic role as Eddie Karpinski, the flamethrower-wielding vigilante in ‘The Fireman,’ ‘The Fireman Part 2,’ and ‘The Fireman 3: CIA Crackdown,'” Tarantino said. “But he was so much more than that, with a career that spanned over 20 years. On this episode of the Video Archives podcast, we invite you to remember Rick Dalton.”Per Tarantino, Booth directed “The Fireman Part 2” after “The Warriors” helmer Walter Hill passed on the project. Actor Dalton also was turned down for the role of Garry in John Carpenter’s “The Thing” before Donald Moffat landed the part.“He also had a thing that happened with him in the late ’60s where three hippies were bursting into his house, and they were tripping, and they had a gun with them, and his stunt double basically beat the brains in of two of them, and Rick set the other one on fire with the flamethrower from ‘The 14 Fists of McCluskey,'” Tarantino said. “So he got invited to, like, the Republican Convention, alright, because it became this thing for, like, Nixon’s Silent Majority. And he’s a lifelong Democrat but he went and they fucking dug him. Rick was very happy being dug. But they put him on Johnny Carson after that and he was a big hit on the Johnny Carson show, and then all of a sudden, because of the notoriety, he started doing better TV shows. He went from, like, doing ‘Land of the Giants’ and ‘Green Hornet’ to doing ‘Mission: Impossible.'”Tarantino added that he conducted an interview with Dalton in 1999 for a panel Q&A event following his 1997 film “Jackie Brown.”The “Inglourious Basterds” helmer previously detailed Dalton’s backstory in the novelization of “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.”Tarantino said during the podcast “The Q&A with Jeff Goldsmith” in 2021 that he wrote “The Films of Rick Dalton” as a book.“It’s written as if Rick is real. You know, they have ‘The Films of Charles Bronson’ and ‘The Films of Anthony Quinn,’ well, it’s done like that, with synopsis and then some critical quotes from the time,” Tarantino said, “and the book goes through every one of Rick’s movies that he did, leading to the end of his career in 1988, I believe, and every one of his episodic television shows.”The official Video Archives podcast Twitter page tweeted last week, “We are saddened by the news of the passing of actor Rick Dalton, best known for his roles in the hit TV series ‘Bounty Law’ and ‘The Fireman’ trilogy. Rick passed away peacefully in his home in Hawaii and is survived by his wife Francesca. RIP Rick Dalton 1933-2023.”",

In 1993, the legendary filmmaker predicted: “When Kitano directs this film, it will surely rival my own ‘Seven Samurai’.” Unfortunately, it’s one of the few times in his later life that Kurosawa was flat-out wrong, though Kitano’s long-in-the-works “Kubi” isn’t entirely without merit.A re-imagining of real events in the late 16th century, the film’s eye-popping, blood-soaked vistas are a marvelous sight, as are a number of its era-specific details, and its handful of striking moments of queer samurai imagery. However, for the most part, Kitano’s tale of ambition and beheadings — many, many beheadings — loses nearly all momentum in its second half, before settling into a rote, repetitive rhythm.Oda Nobunaga was considered the first “great unifier” of Japan, and he’s played here with a case of cackling villainy by a Dracula-caped Kase Ryo, who — despite his truncated role in what is essentially an ensemble piece — lights up the screen. If there’s one thing Kitano knows how to do, it’s extract fun performances from his cast. The central plot concerns the disappearance of one of Oda’s vassals, Murashige Araki (Endo Kenichi), accused by his lordship of rebellious sympathies, followed by Oda’s subsequent attempts to both capture him and suss out dissent within his empire, in a game of territorial chess. He enlists a number of other chieftains to hunt down Murashige — among them, Nishijima Hidetoshi’s diligent, straightforward Akechi Mitsuhide, and Kitano’s more relaxed and world-weary Toyotomi Hideyoshi — with the promise of naming one of them his successor, leading to skirmishes of ambition, and double (and triple) crosses that trickle all the way down the social ladder.Complicating matters further is the fact that Oda, Murashige, and Akechi are involved in a love-triangle of sorts. The real Oda was long believed to have been involved with attendants of the same sex, an idea Kitano attempts to turn into an emotional and thematic centerpiece, with Murashige being enamored by Oda, Akechi being in love with Murashige, and everyone being seduced by power. This yields an electrifying moment where, in order to prove his loyalty to Oda, Murashige bloodies his mouth with his ruler’s blade before they lock lips. Murashige practically falls over himself for Oda’s approval, a cartoonish detail Endo imbues with fiery humanity through glances alone — but it’s one of only two scenes in the film that feels remotely sexually charged (the other is a passionate stare between two shirtless partners, but that’s about it). “Kubi” isn’t so much about queering samurai ambition as it is about likening it to a sexual urge, though neither side of this equation is ever presented with enough verve to sweep viewers up in its epic tale.On the other hand, something Kitano excels at is presenting the absurdity of wanton bloodshed, an idea he sets his sights on early on. As more and more characters are introduced (peasants, performers, gangsters, gunmen, each with their own blood-red on screen text), what binds their stories together is their remorseless desire to scale the feudal hierarchy via the act of beheading.The film’s title, which means “neck,” refers to the kubi bukoro (or “neck bag”), a kind of basket used to carry severed heads for evidence — a procedure that sees several characters stepping over one another in often ridiculous fashion. Right from the opening scene, Kitano revels cheekily in carnage of this particular nature, which he often depicts as cartoonish, and frames as cyclical — even meaningless. However, the collateral damage radiating outward from these scrambles for power are treated with a more deft and respectful hand. If a character loses a loved one, it’s far more tragic than the otherwise uproarious dismemberments on the battlefield or cowardly backstabbing — a tonal contrast Kitano establishes both easily and early on,.The era’s pomp and circumstances is often front and center, with colorful, lumbering armors and heavy fabrics causing an irritating ruckus whenever the characters move. Kudos to the movie’s costume designers and foley team, who help make the legendary samurai seem uncomfortable in their skin, and distinctly un-cool with every step they take (that discomfort isn’t mirrored by the film’s queer characters, mind you; their love is an open secret). However, despite the fine attention to these era-specific details, Kitano’s filmmaking ends up about as over-eager as his scheming characters. Whatever he has to say about power structures, about queer-ness, and about zealous aspirations, he says both clearly and quickly into the movie’s 131-minute running time, so his story ends up back-ended by a repetitive display of surprise attacks and a myriad of pathos-free set pieces that feel practically indistinguishable.This flattening of violent imagery is, in some ways, the entire point of “Kubi,” but it results in a paradoxical undercurrent to what is essentially a war film. The camera is constantly enamored with Kitano’s large-scale dioramas of mischievous movement and sudden blood-spatter. It’s often knee-slapping fun, but that’s a problem, since much of it also plays like a fatalistic rumination on the violence of men, and how it seeks to destroy. Kitano works hard to separate these kinds of scenes, but the switch between them is often abrupt (the ending is equally so), and their interplay seldom has anything worthwhile to say about violence or ambition — whether real or cinematic.What little remains memorable about “Kubi” is only striking in isolation, born from threads, ideas, and slivers of images that seem to have been rattling around Kitano’s brain for over 30 years. Unfortunately, they’ve grown stale; a worthwhile bigger picture never emerges.“Kubi” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "title": "You Don’t Need to Be on Drugs to Appreciate Jim Jarmusch’s Trippy New Project",
        "content": "Jim Jarmusch hopes his latest project — a soundtrack composed with his SQÜRL bandmate Carter Logan for a new restoration of Man Ray silent films — induces in viewers a “psilocybin-inspired” experience.The “Only Lovers Left Alive” and “Stranger Than Paradise” filmmaker and musician, along with Logan, spoke exclusively with IndieWire about the screening of four early-1900s black-and-white shorts from Dadaist pioneer Man Ray hitting Cannes Classics tonight: “Return to Reason,” “Emak-Bakia,” “The Starfish,” and “The Mysteries of the Chateau of Dice.”Together, Jarmusch and Logan improvised an original score, a tripped-out sonic soup of distorted guitars and loopy feedback, now recorded to accompany the films. The quartet of shorts holds up a distorted mirror to human sexuality as Jarmusch and Logan’s eerie music envelops the Freudian dreamscape — and while you might be tempted to drop a tab of acid or mushroom cap or two for the viewing, Jarmusch says that’s not necessary, as the fusion of sound and images here are trying to create that same effect.“Surrealism was about the altering of senses, of perception, and psychedelic music and the use of psychedelic drugs, there’s a place where they intersect,” Jarmusch told IndieWire over Zoom out of a sunny afternoon in Cannes. “We’re not on mushrooms or using psychedelics to create the music, but there’s something of it that’s important to us of where those two things connect in having an altered perception, rather than one that’s force-fed to you. Man Ray and the Dadaists were very interested in altering those perceptions.”Jarmusch certainly isn’t against people using drugs to watch the Man Ray films (or at all), but he said, “We’re trying to get to you to that point without the use of them … psilocybin and certain psychoactive drugs have a vibrational thing to them … I don’t use these drugs, but I am familiar with them from previously in my life. It merges well with Man Ray’s disregard for expected narrative or expected perception.”The soundtrack, a swirl of Moog synthesizer, drums, and distorted guitar, takes you on enough of a hallucinogenic journey, so if you did take drugs watching their Man Ray series, “I think it could induce a really bad trip, honestly, because the films are very strange and the music is dark at times, and you don’t know where you’re going,” Logan said.“I’m an older guy, and having a clarity of consciousness is trippy enough. Things are strange. The longer I live, the more I appreciate just having a consciousness,” Jarmusch said, whose cult features from “Dead Man” to 2019’s “The Dead Don’t Die” and his 2021 YSL short “French Water” already feel as if made on a drugged-out, hypnotic stupor. “It’s trippy enough just being alive.”Jarmusch and Logan started SQÜRL in 2008 as a means to score his Tilda Swinton-starring mystery “The Limits of Control.” The band is just one of Jarmusch’s many clever ways of maintaining full creative control over his projects. But along the road of scoring films like Jarmusch’s Tangier-to-Detroit vampire odyssey “Only Lovers Left Alive” and lonely Adam Driver vehicle “Paterson,” Logan said that he and Jarmusch wanted to do a live score that could be manipulated in real-time with a screening. Enter “New Sounds” WNYC radio host John Schaefer, who gave them the platform to play with the Man Ray films.“We’ve been performing live along with these films on and off for the past eight years or so,” said Logan, who with Jarmusch has taken the Man Ray omnibus up and down each U.S. coast, through the Rust Belt, and in Europe, most recently at the Centre Pompidou. Producers came in and located first-generation nitrate copies of the films, now restored in partnership with the Cineteca di Bologna, La Cinémathèque française, Pompidou, the Library of Congress, and the French CNC.Until now, SQÜRL was just improvising the music alongside the screenings. “While we’ve now recorded it and made a version that will be shown theatrically and otherwise, we didn’t set out to make just a small piece of music for this one part in the film,” Logan said. “It’s a journey we go on and want to take the audience on, exploring themes throughout these films. They are discrete, but there are also echoes that recur and reference each other throughout the whole program.”Jarmusch has long been tactful about the use of music in his films, not only as composed by SQÜRL but also from the likes of Tom Waits, John Lurie, and Iggy Pop (who have also acted in his movies). But recently, Jarmusch said his next movie, a project he’s not keen to spill the details on just yet, might have no music at all.“I probably shouldn’t have said that because we’re now asking me, and I don’t know,” Jarmusch said. “I haven’t shot [the movie] yet, so I’m not totally sure, but my instincts say the sound should be the music. It’s a very quiet film, so maybe little mundane sounds would serve [it] — it’s a film where I don’t want to tell you what to think or feel what is dramatic by the camera or the music.”Jarmusch said he feels frustrated by soundtracks that try too hard to tell audiences how they’re supposed to react to a given scene. “There are a lot of great films with no score,” he said. “I’ve been thinking about ‘No Country for Old Men’ or ‘The Birds’ by Hitchcock. Some films don’t want the music to tell you anything.”He said it’s “frustrating” and “annoying” in “commercial Hollywood movies” how much music does the talking. “There are times when I like a film but I can’t keep watching it because the music is driving me fucking nuts. Sweeping, telling you, ‘Oh, the drama!’ Please. I find it insulting.”Don’t expect SQÜRL to tell you at all how you’re supposed to feel about the fascinatingly weird works of the surrealist Man Ray. Just turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream.“Return to Reason: Man Ray x Jim Jarmusch” premieres at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival on Tuesday, May 23.",

        "title": "Christopher Abbott Rhapsodizes About Yorgos Lanthimos’ ‘Wild,’ ‘Magical’ Sets for ‘Poor Things’",
        "content": "Christopher Abbott is in awe of Yorgos Lanthimos‘ “Poor Things” despite having little screen time.Abbott, who co-stars in the female-led spin on the Frankenstein myth alongside Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, Ramy Youssef, and “Sanctuary” collaborator Margaret Qualley, told The Hollywood Reporter that the teaser trailer for the upcoming film left him stunned.“I loved it,” Abbott said of collaborating with director Lanthimos. “First of all, the set design was incredible. You can see in the teaser how wild it looks, and while it didn’t look exactly like that, I was sort of amazed by how magical the actual sets felt and how detailed they were. When I saw the teaser as well, it was even more vivid and wild than it felt on set. So it just sort of doubled itself, and it looks incredible.”“Poor Things” centers on the incredible tale and fantastical evolution of Bella Baxter (Stone), a young woman brought back to life by the brilliant and unorthodox scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter (Dafoe). Under Baxter’s protection, Bella is eager to learn. Hungry for the worldliness she is lacking, Bella runs off with Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), a slick and debauched lawyer, on a whirlwind adventure across the continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella grows steadfast in her purpose to stand for equality and liberation.The film is based on Scottish author Alasdair Gray’s novel about a woman who drowns herself to escape her abusive husband and is resurrected with the brain of her unborn child. The film is written by “The Great” showrunner Tony McNamara, who also penned Lanthimos’ last film “The Favourite.”While Abbott’s role has been kept under wraps, he called it a “coincidence” that “Sanctuary,” his other film alongside “Poor Things” co-star Qualley, was released prior to “Poor Things.”Abbott told IndieWire that he didn’t “really have anything to do together” with Qualley on Lanthimos’ set, with no overlapping “Poor Things” scene.“We were in Budapest at the same time,” Abbott said, to which Qualley replied, “‘Poor Things,’ I’m like in for two seconds. I haven’t seen it, but I’m excited to see everything Chris does in that movie.”Qualley will also appear in Lanthimos’ “AND” with fellow “Poor Things” actors Stone and Dafoe, as well as Jesse Plemons, Hong Chau, and Joe Alwyn.",

        "content": "Natalie Portman has been waiting almost 20 years to reprise her “Star Wars” prequel role.The “May December” actress revealed during a GQ career retrospective (below) that after starring as Padmé Amidala in the “Star Wars” prequel trilogy films, she is “open” to returning to the franchise but hasn’t been asked.“I have no information on this. No one’s ever asked me to return, but I’m open to it,” Portman told GQ.Portman’s final appearance as Padmé was in 2005 film “Revenge of the Sith,” in which the character seemingly died. Padmé was the love interest of Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and the mother to twins Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa.Portman additionally responded to her “Thor: Love and Thunder” director Taika Waititi forgetting that she was in “Star Wars.” Waititi is set to be writing and directing an upcoming “Star Wars” feature film that deviates from the core franchise characters.“He says he did because he like asked me if I wanted to be in a ‘Star Wars’ movie and I was like, ‘I was,’ ” Portman remembered. “I thought he was joking. He’s such a joker that I thought it was a joke. And then afterwards he said in some interview that he was like cringing afterwards.”“Star Wars” producer Kathleen Kennedy confirmed in April 2023 that Waititi is still currently working on his yet-untitled film.“Taika is still working away,” Kennedy said. “He’s writing the script himself. He doesn’t really want to bring others into that process and I don’t blame him. He has a very, very unique voice. So we want to protect that and that’s what he’s doing. But we’re going to make that one day.”The film’s release is currently dated for December 19, 2025.Waititi teased that his “Star Wars” vision will “expand” the universe behind the sci-fi franchise. “I would like to take something new and create some new characters and just expand the world, otherwise it feels like it’s a very small story,” he said in June 2022.The “Jojo Rabbit” Oscar winner is believed to also be starring in the film.",

        "title": "Michelle Rodriguez Will Take a ‘Backseat’ to ‘Fast and Furious’ Spinoffs: It’s the ‘Next Generation’",
        "content": "Michelle Rodriguez is ready to step out of the driver’s seat for the “Fast and Furious” franchise.The “Fast X” star said that despite the slew of spinoffs in the works from co-star and producer Vin Diesel, she will not be taking a lead role.“You pass the baton on. You take the back seat,” Rodriguez told Variety on the red carpet for the Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project Block Party. “You go passenger side. When it [be]comes the next generation, you have to. It’s the only way to let them define the future.”Diesel confirmed multiple spinoffs are being discussed, including the long-awaited female-fronted standalone film.“I started developing the female spinoff in 2017 with other spinoffs, and the sooner I deliver the finale, the sooner I can launch all the spinoffs,” Diesel said, citing the two-part franchise ending…for now.Diesel previously teased a possible 12th film at the “Fast X” premiere, saying that Universal asked him to make “‘Fast X: The Finale’ a trilogy.”Now, Diesel is putting the comment in reverse gear.“Look how many characters and great talent there is in the movie. There was no way I can pull that off unless I had everyone on for five seconds,” Diesel told Variety. “These characters are appealing and we need to see more of them…It’s bittersweet to think of a finale.”Diesel also addressed the fact that Gal Gadot‘s past cameos were cut from former franchise installments; both Gadot and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson reprise their respective roles for “Fast X” appearances.“We have shot other things a long time ago that might not have fit that specific movie as a finale,” Diesel said of Gadot’s past work. “Doing tags is a very tricky thing because you want your great talent but at the same time you have to be very careful to maintain the emotional state of your audience at the end of the movie. So that’s what you’re juggling.”He added of the “Fast X” cameos, “I’m so excited to have them back home and even more excited to see fan reactions and to see how happy it makes people.”",

        "title": "The Best Mermaid Movies, from ‘Ponyo’ to ‘Little Mermaid’",
        "content": "Beneath every placid surface and between each crashing wave, the movies’ most magical aquatic adventures portend the possibility of mermaids. Half-human, half-fish creatures swam onto the big screen at the turn of the 20th century, appearing in silent works such as Georges Méliès‘ 1904 short film “The Mermaid” and John G. Adolfi’s 1918 feature “Queen of the Sea” among others. The mythical archetype was subsequently reeled in as the effervescent love interest template for numerous ’30s and ’40s rom-coms, with the concept perfected in Irving Pichel’s well-loved talky “Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid,” starring Ann Blyth.The siren songs characteristic of these mysterious ocean-dwellers even resulted in a string of MGM aqua musicals. (You might recall: Those were sent up by Scarlett Johansson in the Coen brothers’ spoofy 2016 flick “Hail, Caesar!”) Disney’s “The Little Mermaid” brought the mermaid musical to the animation-loving masses in 1989, winning Best Original Score and Best Original Song for “Under the Sea” at the Oscars. Darryl Hannah appeared opposite Tom Hanks not much earlier in the 1984 Academy Award-nominated rom-com “Splash,” directed by Ron Howard. Howard’s film is among a league of contemporary mermaid romances, from Elizabeth Allen Rosenbaum’s sparkling “Aquamarine” to M. Night Shyamalan’s insufferable “Lady in the Water.”A Best Picture winner from 2018, Guillermo del Toro’s masterful “The Shape of Water” captures the slippery second side to mermaids in the movies: As much as mermaids are portrayed as beautiful damsels, they can also be vicious monsters dragging heroes to the murky depths. Mermaids, or merfolk in general, have been the bad guys in numerous projects; most notably in Universal’s black-and-white classic “Creature from the Black Lagoon.” Sure, one could argue that’s a sea monster movie as opposed to a mermaid movie. But with charming flicks like “Luca” asking the same question, while so clearly fitting the cheery “best mermaid movie” bill, that seems a semantic argument more than a thematic one.Ranked by both entertainment value and category relevance, here are the 23 best movies about mermaids, sea monsters, and magical creatures walking on land. We’re updating this list in spring 2023, in honor of the release of Disney’s live-action remake of “The Little Mermaid”: swimming into theaters May 26.With editorial contributions by Kate Erbland.Starring Rod Taylor and Doris Day, Frank Tashlin’s instantly lovable 1966 rom-com ranks low on this list not because it’s lacking in quality, but because its connection to mermaids is limited. That said, its inclusion speaks volumes to just how irresistible “Glass Bottom Boat” can be. When aerospace engineer Bruce Templeton accidentally hooks Jennifer Nelson, a diver dressed as a mermaid, off the coast of Catalina, they embark on a whirlwind love-hate relationship. Their passionate affair continues at the office where Jennifer and Bruce both work, inadvertently catching the attention of the CIA.Also known as “Mamula” or “Killer Mermaid,” this Serbian thriller follows friends Kelly (Kristina Klebe) and Lucy (Natalie Burn) on a vacation to Montenegro, where a siren-like creature with razor-sharp teeth awaits. There’s arguably too much going on in director Milan Todorovic’s 2014 nightmare, complete with a secondary antagonist weirdly reminiscent of “I Know What You Did Last Summer.” Still, this is the truest bluest mermaid slasher on the market, staking out essential territory for mythical monsters in the genre.In the gripping, if slightly choppy “Night Tide,” Johnny Drake (Dennis Hopper) is a sailor smitten with a Santa Monica pier performer known as Mora the Mermaid (Linda Lawson). After Johnny learns Mora’s last few boyfriends drowned under mysterious circumstances — and that Mora actually believes she is a mermaid, ravaged by a desire to kill — a kooky-yet-compelling caper sets sail. Is Mora a murderous mer-person or a confused young woman as the traveled Captain Murdock (Gavin Muir) claims? Therein lies the tale.The fourth “Harry Potter” film includes plenty that isn’t mermaid-related, from teenage students fighting literal dragons to the timelessly charming Yule Ball. Still, Harry’s second trial in the Triwizard Tournament — tasked to rescue his friend Ron from an underwater maze overridden with vicious merpeople — stands out among the best moments in this generally strong “Goblet of Fire” adaption from director Mike Newell and screenwriter Steve Kloves. Daniel Radcliffe sells the CGI-heavy sequence with remarkable believability, even as audiences are submerged in the characteristically ludicrous magic of a school murdering students for sport.Jason Momoa stars as D.C. Comics’ titular protector of the deep in “Aquaman,” directed by James Wan. The Hawaiian native is the fourth actor to bring Arthur Curry to the big screen, debuting the role in the original 2017 cut of “Justice League.” Momoa appears opposite Amber Heard, as crown princess Mera, in this stand-alone quest to seize the Trident of Atlan and protect the people of the underwater city of Atlantis. Cue this one up just for soundtrack gem “Ocean to Ocean” performed by Pitbull, featuring an unhinged sampling of Toto’s “Africa.”“Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides” marks the franchise’s fourth sea-faring voyage, this time following Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in pursuit of the Fountain of Youth. That seemingly impossible quest is complicated even further by an ancient ritual — involving a mermaid — that’s required to activate the fountain’s supernatural properties. Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey plays one of numerous mermaids in the 2011 film, opposite love interest Sam Claflin as a lovestruck prisoner. Geoffrey Rush, Penélope Cruz, and more also appear.Written and adapted by Peter Blackmore from his stage play of the same name, “Miranda” tells the whimsical story of a married doctor (Griffith Jones) held captive by a flirtatious mermaid (Glynis Johns). This 1948 comedy replaces the archetypal fantasy romance with an unwelcome house guest arc that still lets its leads — including Googie Withers as the doctor’s wife — achieve hysterical chemistry. Come for the promise of a mermaid conning her way into a free trip to London. Stay for the wheelchair and strategically placed blanket she uses to get there.If you haven’t yet seen this staple of horrifying spoof cinema, then you should metaphorically run — not walk — to the nearest streaming service with its “Cabin in the Woods” lights on. If you have already seen it, then you know exactly why the spoiler-riffic 2011 movie is appearing on a list about mermaids. Technicians Gary Sitterson (Richard Jenkins) and Steve Hadley (Bradley Whitford) discuss mermaids at length in the unconventional zombie flick, which reframes the half-human sea creatures as vicious predators. Don’t google this one.Writer-director John Sayles dives into author Rosalie K. Fry’s 1957 novel “Secret of the Ron Mor Skerry” in this understated exploration of selkies, creatures of Celtic and Norse mythology described as transformed seals who can shed their skin to appear human on land. When 12-year-old Fiona Coneelly (Jeni Courtney) moves to an isolated fishing village to stay with her grandparents, she grows convinced her long lost baby brother is living along the shoreline. The fanciful-yet-simple adventure has an almost meditative quality, guided by the knowing hand of the mind behind “Matewan.”In the long-awaited follow-up to 2018’s “Black Panther,” Ryan Coogler sets Wakanda on a collision course with another secretive nation. With cleverly engineered face masks that allow them to breathe air and the ancient warrior Namor (Tenoch Huerta) serving as their fearsome leader, the aquatic Talokan people emerge on land as a worthy adversary for Princess Shuri (Letitia Wright) and Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) in an otherwise formulaic Marvel outing that’s as middling as the rest of Phase 4. They’re not the scariest merpeople on this list, but witness the act one Talokan assault on a U.S. Navy ship and you’ll see why they might qualify for the best organized. One of the better Disney Channel Original Movies of its time, “The Thirteenth Year” is so titled for its teenage protagonist Cody (Chez Starbuck). The star swimmer leads a relatively typical life, despite having been left with his adoptive fisherman father (Brent Briscoe) by his mysterious mermaid mother (Stephanie Chantel Durelli) on a boat 13 years ago. It isn’t until after the clock strikes midnight on Cody’s birthday that his aquatic powers — inexplicably including electric sparks flying from his fingers and the ability to full-on Peter Parker up walls – begin to appear.“Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid” is a fountain of ’40s charm, starring William Powell as Arthur Peabody and Ann Blyth as his maritime mistress, whom Arthur calls Lenore. Although Arthur is married to the kind Polly Peabody (Irene Hervey), he’s troubled by the malaise of his marriage. After he hooks Lenore and hides her in a pond, Arthur slips into a comedy of errors oozing with ridiculousness and romance. Andrea King, Clinton Sundberg, Art Smith, and more round out the cast.Sara Paxton is the titular “Aquamarine” in director Elizabeth Allen Rosenbaum’s easy-breezy teen rom-com. In the wake of one girl’s parents’ decision to move, best friends Hailey (JoJo) and Claire (Emma Roberts) discover a mermaid in a pool, who just so happens to be running from a royal betrothal back home. As the newfound trio of friends gets closer, so does the end of the summer. With talking starfish for earrings and magic nail polish to match her mood, Aquamarine may be cinema’s cutest mermaid.Triumphant and sparkling, Scarlett Johansson ever so briefly captures the shining history of mermaids’ many musical appearances on the silver screen for Joel and Ethan Coen’s “Hail, Caesar!” Maybe you remember the image: a beautiful blonde wearing a fish-scaled swimsuit, ready to dive into a crystal-blue pool where a synchronized routine awaits. It’s evocative of multiple musicals with mermaid motifs, including the 1949 flick “Neptune’s Daughter,” providing a stunning backdrop for Johansson’s unapologetically uproarious comedic performance.It’s star Halle Bailey, appearing in her first leading role, who makes the best case for why this classic Disney tale needed to be made into a live-action affair. Just look at her face, so expressive and so open, so deeply and wonderfully human and alive. There are some things even the most lovingly rendered pieces of hand-drawn animation just can’t match, and Bailey’s emotive skill is one of them. (And her stunning singing? Further icing on the “this young woman is a movie star” cake.) —KERead IndieWire’s complete review of “The Little Mermaid” by Kate Erbland.Among the highest grossing Chinese theatrical releases ever, Stephen Chow’s “The Mermaid” is a visually luxurious exploration of mermaid society and amphibious romance as weird as it is endearing. After property mogul Liu Xuan (Deng Chao) begins developing a nature preserve where a group of mermaids secretly lives, the cunning Shan (Lin Yun) attempts to assassinate him. But the pair’s electric dynamic soon begets a romance that puts Shan and her home, as well as Liu and his career, at risk. The vibrant colors and costuming are worth diving in for alone.Director Jack Arnold’s “Creature from the Black Lagoon” joined the Universal Monster Movie catalog later that you’d think, arriving in theaters more than 20 years after “Dracula” made his dastardly debut in 1931. One can debate Gill-man’s classification as a merman (though the name “Gill-man” is an argument unto itself), but undeniable is the creature’s impact on cinema. “Creature from the Black Lagoon” has been evoked in countless other mer-properties, most notably including 2018 Best Picture winner (and second place on this list) “The Shape of Water.”Sea monsters living in the canals of an Italian town embark on a land-and-sea adventure in “Luca,” Pixar’s characteristically delightful aquatic romp from summer 2021. Nominated for Best Animated Feature, director Enrico Casarosa’s coming-of-age flick follows the titular mer-boy (voiced by Jacob Tremblay) and his best friend Alberto Scorfano (Jack Dylan Grazer) in a literal fish-out-water fairy tale anchored in morals about loyalty and friendship. Not only is the colorful character design of “Luca” a feast for the eyes, but it boasts a light and airy tone perfect for family audiences.Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe engage in an unnervingly gorgeous, stunningly tense two-hander for Robert Eggers’ “The Lighthouse.” Shot in black-and-white with a four-to-three aspect ratio, the cryptic psychological thriller about two 19th century men working a month-long shift at a New England lighthouse can — and has — been interpreted dozens of ways. But the mermaid at its center, played by Valeriia Karamän, is its inarguable linchpin, further enriching the film’s already substantial drama with opulent terror.If any movie can be called the mermaid movie, it’s this mermaid movie. Voiced by Jodi Benson, Disney princess Ariel has defined mermaids for generations with her jazzy story of a charming prince, evil sea witch, and league of oceanic sidekicks. Parts of “The Little Mermaid” hold up better than others, certainly. (Sacrificing your voice for a man? Bad. Pat Carroll singing “Poor Unfortunate Souls”? So good it should be criminalized.) But broadly speaking, it’s an enduring animated take on Hans Christian Andersen’s 19th century fairy tale. If you like Disney classics about big dreamers, then “The Little Mermaid” should almost certainly be — wait for it — part of your world.Darryl Hannah and Tom Hanks take a surprisingly refreshing dip in classic rom-com waters for “Splash,” director Ron Howard’s 1984 meet-cute between a man who returns to Cape Cod to find a mysterious young girl he met as a child. Co-writers Brian Grazer, Babaloo Mandel, Bruce Jay Friedman, and Lowell Ganz were nominated for Best Original Screenplay at that year’s Academy Awards for their work on the hilarious and heartfelt saga of a mermaid trying to stay secret in New York City.Guillermo del Toro’s “The Shape of Water” won Best Picture at the 2017 Oscars, finally bringing horror’s 26-year shutout in the category to an end. It also happens to be about a merman-like creature and its plot oozes with mermaid movie tropes. Sally Hawkins stars as Elisa, a soft-hearted cleaner at a 1960s Baltimore testing facility who falls for a test subject, portrayed by titan of creature performance Doug Jones. Romantic and lush as it is unsettling, “The Shape of Water” married land and sea in ways no other film — including “Creature from the Black Lagoon” — ever has.Hayao Miyazaki captures and then rapidly expands upon the enduring charm of “The Little Mermaid” in his triumphant tenth film about a runaway goldfish and the 5-year-old human who rescues her. “Ponyo” differs from Han Christian Andersen’s Danish fairy tale in myriad ways; chief among them that our adorable protagonist slowly wills herself to become human instead of haggling with a sexy octopus for it. But it’s the bubbling flourishes and unique expansions Miyazaki brings to “Ponyo” that make it the best mermaid movie ever: an effervescent blend of imagination, magic, and heart.",

        "title": "No Streamer, No Problem: Lionsgate and Sony Movies Thrive at Home Without Them",
        "content": "With six of the top eight film distributors committed to their own streaming sites — and all the expenses that come with them — the two studios that operate without a streamer continue to elevate home viewing without that heavy investment.Universal has three films occupying eight positions this week, led by the just-released “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” that’s #1 on all three VOD charts. Lionsgate also has three films in eight slots, while Sony has three films in six slots — plus, three more films in the Netflix top 10.Multiple placements aren’t unusual for Universal; it has high volume as well as a consistent PVOD policy that often sees titles surface in a month or less. For the scrappier Lionsgate, this achievement demanded a lot of smart strategy. Both “Operation Fortune: Russe de Guerre” and “Sisu” showed limited interest in theaters (each grossed around $7 million). Yet each has shown strength on PVOD, ahead of films that did much better.“Sisu” is a Finnish World War II film that sounds like the kind of international action title that Netflix debuts regularly, usually to brief attention. It premiered at Midnight Madness at last year’s Toronto, with Sony Worldwide taking rights including North America, then turning over distribution to Lionsgate. That the film is clicking at home — #2 at both iTunes and Vudu — suggests its theatrical play raised awareness to an audience that was eager to see a new war-themed title. (Our David Ehrlich places it firmly in the “they pissed off the wrong guy” genre.)Lionsgate released both films to home audiences before “John Wick: Chapter 4,” which opened in theaters weeks earlier. It comes to PVOD Tuesday (according to iTunes’s daily chart, pre-sales place it at #10). Don’t be surprised if it supplants “SMB,” at least initially. Universal is charging an elevated $24.99 for rental, $29.99 to download making the profit even greater.Four other titles placed on all three sites. Sony’s “65,” with a reduced $5.95 price, is as high #3 (iTunes), with still-$19.99 “The Covenant” (MGM), “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” (Paramount, #2 at Google Play), and “Evil Dead Rise” (Warner Bros. Discovery) completing the list.Two other debuting titles are “To Catch a Killer” (Vertical) and “Big George Foreman” (Sony). Starring Shaillene Woodley, “To Catch a Killer” is the American debut from Damián Szifron, the Argentine director of “Wild Tales.” It had a minimal theatrical run and placed as high as #5 on iTunes at $6.99. “Foreman,” which flopped badly in theaters, debuted on VOD at $19.99 after its third weekend. That price helped it make Vudu’s chart, since it scores by revenue not transactions.“Missing ” is the latest Sony film to score a #1 ranking at Netflix; it’s the sequel to 2018’s “Searching,” a $7 million sleeper that grossed $37 million after its Sundance premiere. “A Man Called Otto” is still #3; it’s joined in the top five by “The Son,” the Sony Pictures Classics follow-up to “The Father” that caused barely a ripple in theaters ($450,000 gross) despite Hugh Jackman in the lead. Its response looks like another case of Netflix’s millions of viewers clicking play when they find a film they know nothing about but with a big star.“The Mother” with Jennifer Lopez is #2 in its second week. Two other originals debuted as well — the documentary “Anna Nicole Smith: You Don’t Know Me” and from the Netherlands “Faithfully Yours,” a thriller.iTunes and Google Play rank films daily by number of transactions.

        "title": "Disney’s Unending Live-Action Adaptations Ranked, from ‘Pinocchio’ to ‘Mulan’ to ‘The Little Mermaid’",
        "content": "To quote one of the best sitcoms ever: “Did you just double-dip that chip?”If George Constanza was a real person — and the opinions of “Seinfeld” characters had any bearing on major movie slates — Disney CEO Bob Iger would be forced to answer in the affirmative some 20 times over thanks to his company’s buffet of CGI-laden remakes, sequels, and spin-offs. The entertainment giant has spat out scads of these so-called “revivals” of its animated classics in recent years, with critics routinely pointing out the bottom line motivating the mostly mediocre trend.And yet, no matter how poor the reception, the Disney live-action revisits just keep coming. In 2023, nearly every major animated Disney classic is accompanied by an overly expensive — wildly under-justified — successor sporting A-list actors and little else. Robert Zemeckis delivered a Tom Hanks-starring “Pinocchio” last year, which IndieWire’s Christian Zilko called “barely a real film.” Kate Erbland enjoyed Rob Marshall’s upcoming “The Little Mermaid” starring Halle Bailey much better, but argued it tried too hard to be part of our world. Up next, audiences will be asked to endure Disney rehashing “Bambi,” “Hercules,” “Snow White,” and even “Lilo and Stitch.”There have been exceptions to the “Disney remakes are bad” rule: Kenneth Branagh’s “Cinderella” is an undeniably charming re-telling of the quintessential fairytale, while David Lowery’s “Pete’s Dragon” arguably surpasses the original. Plus, Craig Gillespie’s “Cruella” starring Emma Stone as the notorious dognapper is simply too entertaining to begrudge. Still, the rule is a rule for a reason. By and large, Disney remakes are exhausting regurgitations that tend to undermine the joy of Disney’s most historically significant films.These contemporary remakes have been hugely successful at the box office, of course: a kind of tried-and-true cinematic daycare for parents looking to see something kid-friendly. There’s merit in that, to be sure. But less understandable is the introduction of straight-to-streaming remakes, presented right alongside the original film — with both exclusive to Disney+. Like George enjoying a crunchy snack, it’s a textbook example of giving the metaphoric chip that forbidden double-dip.Broken down by pros and cons (with synopses omitted, since we know you know these movies), here are all 21 of Disney’s major live-action remakes and revivals ranked.With editorial contributions by Kate Erbland.Pros: Director James Bobin’s “Alice Through the Looking Glass” — a follow-up to Tim Burton’s 2010 box office smash “Alice in Wonderland” — is very colorful. Also, an exceptionally over-it Sacha Baron Cohen plays a sentient clock, so that’s fun.Cons: Pretty much every other thing about this exhausting mistake of a movie is vexing. Not only does “Alice Through the Looking Glass” offer next to nothing for fans of Lewis Carroll, but it also manages to spectacularly mangle the “female hysteria” plot introduced in its Victorian-era prologue by smashing together a bunch of nonsensical scenes, sticking Mia Wasikowska in the middle of them, and blindly hoping for a feminist adventure epic. The 2016 sequel is a classic example of a filmmaker confusing a poorly spent, bloated budget with psychedelic maximalism: It’s not trippy, just annoying.Read IndieWire’s review of “Alice Through the Looking Glass.”Pros: Glenn Close still manages to dazzle as Cruella De Vil in the deeply underwhelming sequel film “102 Dalmatians.” Both Kevin Lima’s follow-up and the original live-action “101 Dalmatians” remake from 1996 score big points for using real animals to tell their zany stories. It’s worth it for the mouthy macaw, named Waddlesworth, alone.Cons: As unclever as its excruciating title, “102 Dalmatians” tells practically the exact same story as its 1996 predecessor — which in turn rehashes the 1961 original — and a copy of a copy does not a decent movie make.Pros: Tom Hanks emerges from this whale of a bad time mostly unscathed, delivering a reasonably likable performance as Geppetto: iconically weird dad to a puppet and infamously bad pet owner. (Seriously, who brings a kitten and a goldfish on a rescue mission?) Cons: Pinocchio is as wooden as a post and his exasperating movie as gnarled as a hangman’s tree. Maybe Disney+ audiences could forgive all that, if it weren’t for the unmitigated nightmare fuel that is live-action Pleasure Island. Yes, watching human children morph into donkeys in a sequence best described as CGI-meets-Cronenberg nightmare fuel is terrifying. But more than that, Robert Zemeckis’ “Pinocchio” feels mean in its morality: treating its dozens of child actors with as much empathy as Honest John.Read IndieWire’s complete review of “Pinocchio.” Pros: Angelina Jolie dons horns once more for director Joachim Rønning’s sequel to “Maleficent”: Disney’s live-action “Sleeping Beauty” reimagining from 2014. Playing opposite Elle Fanning’s Aurora again, the Academy Award winner cuts through the film’s utter soullessness with her icy gaze, razor-sharp cheeks, and knack for action performance. Jolie also delivers some astoundingly silly lines with real bite.Cons: “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil” has too little Maleficent and an excess of everything else. Its metaphoric wings pinned down by too much lore and far too many CGI flowers, the 2019 film concocts an uninteresting inciting incident, builds to a battle that’s equally as bland, and finishes far from the 1959 animated classic. When Jolie is on screen, it’s tolerable. But when she’s not invited to the metaphoric party, it’s genuinely disastrous: a nauseating blend of aesthetic excess and narrative thinness exemplifying what many Disney fans find objectionable about these films.Read IndieWire’s review of “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.” Pros: Director Tim Burton renders an unprecedentedly adorable elephant for his 2019 take on “Dumbo.” Rivaling the baby-faced star of the 1941 original, CGI Dumbo is a big-eyed, big-eared, snuggly lump who loves playing with feathers and bouncing on trapeze safety nets. Plus, Danny Devito and Michael Keaton deliver outrageously goofy performances as a low-rent ringmaster and villainous amusement park owner respectively.Cons: Though the image of a creature with ears so big they double as wings seems like fun for the whole family, “Dumbo” is a deeply sad story and Burton delivers a decidedly dark remake of the tale. Recall that Dumbo doesn’t like being in the circus and, as with Bambi before him, Dumbo’s mother being unceremoniously ripped away from him plays a big part in that. You’ll feel exactly how Burton would like you to feel in the moment, but there’s no justifying hitting beats this grim in a muddled movie that otherwise can’t measure up.Read IndieWire’s review of “Dumbo.”Pros: Tim Burton brought his goofy-yet-gothic POV to the topsy-turvy world of Underland for his remake of “Alice in Wonderland”: the 2010 Disney remake most directly responsible for opening the floodgate on this unfortunate IP trend. It’s most notable for its singular costume, make-up, and production design with performances from Helena Bonham Carter as the Queen of Hearts and Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter earning the most praise among the cast.Cons: “Alice in Wonderland” made more than $1 billion at the worldwide box office, but was a staggering disappointment to critics. Burton’s distinctive art style meshed poorly with the super-slick CGI and the story was meaningless: a string of vague Lewis Carroll references anchored by a nonplussed Mia Wasikowska.Pros: As beloved as just about any A-lister could be these days, Emily Blunt was born to play Mary Poppins. The British actress breathes effortless life into the prim and propper governess, matching both the levity and the shrewdness of Julie Andrews’ legendary rendering of the character from 1964. Cons: The slowness of Robert Stevenson’s “Mary Poppins” still feels like a nostalgic stroll: a meandering walk taken with P. L. Travers’ most beloved characters that’s justified by its steadfast originality and committment to explicitly pondering life’s greatest lessons. Rob Marshall’s modern sequel, however, is mainly boring. The 2018 film is loyal to and sweet about the source material, yes. But without the energy of a live Broadway show to support it, seeing different actors portray the same Great Depression-era characters — only this time singing worse songs — feels more like punishment than play.Read IndieWire’s review of “Mary Poppins Returns.”Pros: Jon Favreau remains a loyal subject to “The Lion King” in this near beat-for-beat remake of the 1994 animated treasure, featuring the voice acting of Donald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Billy Eichner, Seth Rogen, John Oliver, and more. Voicing Nala, Beyoncé performs cherished original track “Can You Feel the Love Tonight” as well as original song “Spirit.” Cons: Favreau’s photorealistic “The Lion King” may be exacting and fastidious in its recreations, but creative it is not: producing a tired re-skinning of a tale told better the first time. With both versions exclusive to Disney+, the case for watching this one over the other is as weak as a hyena’s allegiance. Here’s hoping Barry Jenkins’ Mufasa prequel brings pride back to Pride Rock. Read IndieWire’s complete review of “The Lion King.”Pros: It’s star Halle Bailey, appearing in her first leading role, who makes the best case for why this classic Disney tale needed to be made into a live-action affair. Just look at her face, so expressive and so open, so deeply and wonderfully human and alive. There are some things even the most lovingly rendered pieces of hand-drawn animation just can’t match, and Bailey’s emotive skill is one of them. (And her stunning singing? Further icing on the “this young woman is a movie star” cake.)Cons: So, does it look real? Sometimes, sure, but that’s a strange worry for a story that is — again, again — about mythical sea creatures. That trend will likely continue to be true for the foreseeable future, but until the House of Mouse cracks the real problem at hand, these films will never become classics on their own merit.That problem: Does it feel real? Not yet, and not even movie star turns and rapping birds and the very best of intentions can bridge that divide. For now, “The Little Mermaid” exists outside of the very world it so wants to be a part of, one already so lovingly rendered in its predecessor, “real” or not. —KERead IndieWire’s complete review of “The Little Mermaid” by Kate ErblandPros: Casting a post-“Harry Potter” Emma Watson as the bookish beauty Belle was a smart move by Disney. Donning a yellow gown at once reminiscent of both the animated 1991 classic and Hermione’s Yule Ball dress, Watson at the very least looked the part of Disney’s most well-read princess. Plus, the extraordinarily detailed rendering of Beast’s castle felt a bit like a Hogwarts.Cons: From inanimate objects too realistic to relate to and the unabashed queer-baiting of telling fans there would be an “exclusively gay” moment that never came, “Beauty and the Beast” was a small PR disaster for Disney. Director Bill Condon delivers some reasonably entertaining beats, but “Beauty and the Beast” feels like a cashgrab from start to finish. Hey, no one said selling audiences on a clandestine romance between a prisoner and the talking bison holding her captive would be easy.Read IndieWire’s review of “Beauty and the Beast.”Pros: Jason Scott Lee, Sam Neill, John Cleese, Cary Elwes, Lena Headey, and more stars appear alongside some of the most patient animals show business has ever known in this action-packed expansion of Rudyard Kipling’s story of a young boy growing up in the jungle. Technically speaking, the 1994 film is the first live-action Disney remake; though “Alice in Wonderland” kicked off the more recent stint of IP recycling in 2010. (It’s also possible that you can read this film as a live-action sequel to the original animated movie.) Come for the promise of over-the-top “Indiana Jones”-style action. Stay for Lee selling the hell out of a surprising tearjerker.Cons: Directed by Stephen Sommers, who co-wrote its script with Ronald Yanover and Mark Geldman, this “The Jungle Book” is about as far from the animated original as you can get. It’s almost enough to discount the title from consideration on our list altogether. But considering this Disney-produced remake/sequel is (broadly speaking) pretty good — when so many others are really not — it makes the cut. Pros: IndieWire’s David Ehrlich hit the nail on the head when he called David Lowery’s “Pete’s Dragon” remake “a new Disney classic.” Not only does Lowery’s script (co-written with Toby Halbrooks) effortlessly expand on the under-watched 1977 gem,  but it sincerely captures what makes the original story of a boy and his pet dragon worth revisiting.Cons: In addition to changings scads of details, the new “Pete’s Dragon” boasts not a single song. Making the film a musical arguably would have detracted from its poignant, soft-hearted story of friendship, but for some fans, songs (such as “Candle on the Water” and “Brazzle Dazzle Day”) are essential.Read IndieWire’s review of “Pete’s Dragon.”Pros: Disney fans were understandably befuddled by Guy Ritchie’s decision to turn Will Smith into an oversized smurf for his “Aladdin” remake. But there’s no denying that the outrageously theatrical performance of Smith as Genie works in the context of the film: a larger-than-life centerpiece that anchors the well-loved romance of a princess and so-called “street rat.” Cons: Despite strong showings from leads Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott, “Aladdin” struggles to feel compelling in the same way as the original. Maybe it’s the lackluster choreography or characteristically awkward CGI. Worse, however, is the sense that Disney compromised on its casting: Accusations that white extras were made up with brown makeup to “blend in” proved true and the addition of new character Prince Anders, who is white and played by Billy Magnussen, felt at the very least misguided. Read IndieWire’s review of “Aladdin.”Pros: Winnie the Pooh has never been more adorable. In “Christopher Robin,” Ewan McGregor stars as the friend to the Hundred Acre Wood’s most famous honey-loving inhabitant. Jim Cummings, who has voiced the simple-minded bear since 1988, nails the unmistakable delivery generations of Disney fans have come to know and love, while the CGI rendering — emphasizing Pooh’s identity as a well-loved stuffed animal — brings out new charms. The film received an Oscar nod for Best Visual Effects.Cons: Awfully similar to the Robin Williams-starring “Hook,” director Marc Forster’s “Christopher Robin” imagines an adult Christopher as a stressed-out luggage salesman who returns to Pooh, Tigger, Piglet, and the rest of his childhood friends when Pooh ventures into the real world to find him. It’s a funny idea that leads to some sweet moments, but more often sees McGregor trying too hard to progress an underdeveloped character who pulls focus at the worst possible times.Read IndieWire’s review of “Christopher Robin.”Pros: One of the few “live-action” Disney remakes to use real animals, “Lady and the Tramp” brought scads of adorable dogs to Disney+ at the streaming service’s launch. (Fun fact: All of the dogs in the film are rescues and human actor Yvette Nicole Brown adopted one of them when production wrapped.) Appropriately nostalgic — meaning the offensive Siamese cats song got cut — director Charlie Bean’s remake smartly expands on the notion of a dog feeling usurped by a human baby, while preservering the thematic underpinnings of the 1955 animation. Cons: Has no one learned anything from the 1999 TV movie “Animal Farm”? Bean makes the wholly unecessary choice to animate his canine actors’ mouths in “Lady and the Tramp”: an unsettling misstep that detracts from every genuine moment. Read IndieWire’s review of “Lady and the Tramp.”Pros: A compelling performance from Liu Yifei, impressive fight choreography, and a brave willingness to diverge from the original makes “Mulan” a recent standout among Disney’s recycled IP. Introducing new villains, played by Jason Scott Lee and Gong Li, the 2020 “Mulan” is a sweeping war epic that shows an even stronger side to the fabled female hero. Cons: In addition to irritating some Disney purists with the removal of animated love interest Li Shang, the “Mulan” remake was criticized for its lack of diversity behind the camera. Director Niki Caro responded in a 2020 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, saying: “Although it’s a critically important Chinese story and it’s set in Chinese culture and history, there is another culture at play here, which is the culture of Disney, and that the director, whoever they were, needed to be able to handle both — and here I am.” Read IndieWire’s review of “Mulan.”Pros: Who better to receive a villainous origin story than the iconic Maleficent? With mega-watt talent Angelina Jolie cast in the title role and Elle Fanning playing Princess Aurora, director Robert Stromberg weaves a morally gray tale about motherhood that beautifully augments “Sleeping Beauty” with a film that’s part revisionist prequel and part fantasy character study.Cons: Unfortunately, the original story at the heart of “Maleficent” doesn’t keep the film from feeling predictable. Like reading a picture book to a child for the umpteenth time, “Maleficent” feels like something you’ve already seen: whether that’s true or not. Read IndieWire’s review of “Maleficent.”Pros: Glenn Close reigns supreme as the best Disney live-action casting to date, debuting her sensationally sinister Cruella for director Stephen Herek’s 1996 take on “101 Dalmatians.” Part “Fatal Attraction,” part “The Stepford Wives,” Close’s take on the infamous dog-napper is a smart repurposing of the fabric that made the original a tried-and-true staple of Disney’s animated closet: and she’s dressed exquisitely. Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson play off Close as live-action Roger and Anita.Cons: Producer John Hughes, known for “Home Alone” among other American family favorites, can’t help but force slapstick comedy where it shouldn’t be in a conflict that too often feels forced when the possibility of dead dogs should easily motivate.Pros: Emma Stone brings her Academy Award-winning theatricality to the role of Cruella de Vil in this devilishly delightful tale of an aspiring clothing designer warring with her cruel boss: The Baroness, played by a bombastic Emma Thompson. “Cruella” is at its best when delivering over-the-top costume reveals: wearable street art-turned-avant-garde PR attacks that redefined spectacle for the Disney remake field.Cons: Craig Gillespie’s “Cruella” has plenty of “101 Dalmatians” nods, but in no way exists in the same narrative world as the original animated film. Even after the credits role, there’s no believing this feisty fashionista would skin dozens of puppies.Read IndieWire’s review of “Cruella.”Pros: Jon Favreau’s 2016 “The Jungle Book” is as loyal to its source material as the director’s inferior 2019 “The Lion King” for good and bad. But what its story lacks in originality, “The Jungle Book” makes up for with cinematographer Bill Pope’s innovative visual exploration of the dense jungle and animal kingdom as Neel Sethi’s Mowgli experiences them. Plus, it doesn’t get much better than Bill Murray voicing Baloo. Cons: Favreau’s fantastic environment too often bumps against the cartoonish talking animals, leaving audiences stuck in a sandpit of realism when the plot requires we suspend our disbelief.Read IndieWire’s review of “The Jungle Book.”Pros: Lily James is perfectly cast as Cinderella, opposite Cate Blanchett’s wickedly delicious Lady Tremaine: rivaled only by Anjelica Huston’s performance as the evil stepmother from the 1998 live-action film “Ever After.” With truly fairytale-like production design — right down to the sky blue gown — screenwriter Chris Weitz’s “Cinderella” expands the quintessential Disney classic with an enriching exploration of happily ever after that feels almost as magical as the first time that storied clock struck midnight. Cons: As with so many Disney live-action remakes, “Cinderella” is infested with some truly regrettably CGI animals. Plus, as far as justification goes, director Kenneth Branagh sort of just assumes his audience wants a faithful retell. If you don’t, it could be dull.Read IndieWire’s review of “Cinderella.”",

        "title": "‘The Color Purple’ Trailer: Fantasia and Taraji P. Henson Bring Alice Walker’s Classic to Musical Life",
        "content": "Alice Walker’s timeless novel “The Color Purple” is returning to the big screen for the first time in four decades.Steven Spielberg’s Oscar-nominated 1985 adaptation followed a young Black woman named Celie (then played by Whoopi Goldberg) trying to find her identity in rural Georgia while coping with her abusive father and the prejudices of the post-Antebellum South and forming a close connection with jazz singer Shug. A stage musical adaptation of Walker’s book debuted on Broadway in 2005, with Celie played by the likes of LaChanze and Cynthia Erivo throughout its run and revival. Now, in director Blitz Bazawule’s Warner Bros. film version of the musical (out Christmas Day), R&B star Fantasia Barrino, who appeared on Broadway in the show from 2007 to 2008 and then in the national tour two years later, takes on the role of Celie, with Taraji P. Henson as Shug. Watch the first official trailer for “The Color Purple” below.Producer Oprah Winfrey and director Bazawule shared the trailer exclusively during a virtual event on May 22. The footage showcases the film’s epic cast across a time-spanning narrative, with exuberant fantasy and dream sequences and images of the young Celie (played by “The Little Mermaid” breakout Halle Bailey) juxtaposed with an older Celie, who escapes her present into soul-stirring musical reverie.During the trailer launch, Winfrey promised a “reimagined, bold new take on ‘The Color Purple’ almost 40 years later,” adding, “As long as there is a need for people to feel what it means to be loved up… there will be a need for ‘The Color Purple.’ We have our iteration coming out on December 25, and I believe that in the future, this story just grows, and it never grows old.”Colman Domingo, Corey Hawkins, Danielle Brooks, H.E.R., Ciara, Bailey, Louis Gosset Jr., David Alan Grier, Aunjanue Ellis, and many more round out the star-studded cast. Bazawule previously directed segments of Beyoncé’s visual album “Black Is King” and the celebrated 2018 Ghanaian feature “The Burial of Kojo.” Producers of 2023’s “The Color Purple” include Winfrey, Spielberg, Quincy Jones, and Scott Sanders, with cinematography by Guillermo del Toro regular Dan Laustsen.“American Idol” breakout Barrino has long been an advocate for abuse survivors, previously revealing her own experiences with sexual assault as a teenager. “I came from sexual assault as a young girl. I came from domestic abuse. And I learned through this movie that not only could I heal, but I could forgive,” Winfrey recalled Barrino saying in early conversations about the production.Winfrey said Bazawule “was like the fifth or sixth director” they’d spoken to about heading up the film. “Blitz presented these storyboards, and within five minutes of Zooming with him, I was texting [producer] Scott Sanders and everybody else, ‘Oh my god, this is the guy.'”“You dream of things like this, and then they happen,” Bazawule said. “The obvious instinct is to go, ‘Well, that can’t be me,” he said. “The bar is so high… But first I read the script and said, ‘I see what [screenwriter] Marcus [Gardley] is trying to do here,’ and of course, I sat with Steven and Oprah and Scott Sanders and the Warner Bros. team, and it was clear they were really going to allow us to expand the canon of ‘The Color Purple,’ which first began with, ‘How do we create an internal headspace for Celie?'”Bazawule added, “I wanted to create the most epic, boldest visual motifs… Someone called it ‘magical realist,’ that was kind of what we leaned into.” He said he wanted to “create some level of parallel between the music and the character,” leaning on the greats of gospel and blues to fuse the songs with the images. “When you put it all together, you have a tapestry that’s beautiful, that’s joyous…that’s healing.”The screenplay comes from Marcus Gardley (“Maid,” “The Chi”), who adapts stage adaptation with a book Marsha Norman and music and lyrics by Brenda Russell, Allee Willis, and Stephen Bray.As Spielberg’s “Color Purple” earned 11 Oscar nominations including Best Picture, Warner Bros. is surely eyeing a serious awards contender here.",

        "title": "‘Marguerite’s Theorem’ Review: Math Drama Doesn’t Multiply Into Anything Meaningful",
        "content": "The burnout associated with gifted kid syndrome — the crushing realization that, after constant praise and validation as a child, you’re not as special as everybody told you that you were — has become a self-diagnosed internet ailment of the most annoying people you know, determined to blame their obnoxious high standards on their parents and teachers. It’s a well-worn screen trope, whether through countless “yep, that’s me, you probably are wondering how I ended up here”–style biopics of real-life geniuses to the Rachel Berry brand of insufferable know-it-alls.Perhaps that explains how initially unlikeable Marguerite is, then: a dazzlingly smart student of mathematics at the prestige École Normale Supérieure, whose three year quest to make a field-shattering breakthrough ends in humiliation, disbelief, and the childish instinct to retreat into a hole. French-Swedish director Anna Novion (who, prior to filmmaking, was a researcher of Ingmar Bergman, perhaps influencing this film’s intently scholarly focus) crafts a film that plots its coordinates in a familiar territory — that of the genius doggedly determined to Prove Their Worth — yet ultimately struggles to do what the best movies of this type do, which is manage to make the audience care about whatever their character cares about. That is unless you come to this project fully versed in the infamous unsolvability of Goldbach’s conjecture in the realm of number theory.We open on the title character being interviewed by a member of the press, who is both unimpressed with the lifeless, greasy-haired genius before her and lightly amused by her kooky choice to turn up to the rendez-vous in her slippers. Marguerite, transplanted from a life in the suburbs with her protective mother to one of Paris’ grande écoles thanks to a scholarship, has dedicated her entire life to the study of mathematics. But when pressed to reveal any other hobbies, she can only come up with “walking” and “playing yahtzee”; she’s a true nose-in-book and wire-rimmed glasses geek, barely socializing with anyone apart from her cold supervisor and mocked by her fellow students for her textbook nerd behavior.Her carefully plotted life falls off its axis, however, when a room full of male contemporaries publicly disprove her thesis’s theorem, leading her to have an insolent crisis and drop out of college and move into the apartment of a cool, if freeloading, dancer called Noa. Now, she finally has the opportunity to live the teenage years she never had — blundering sexual encounters, dire digs, and an insipid retail job in a shoe store to boot. After a savant-like ability to master the Chinese tile game mahjong gives her a new purpose and monetary support, she eventually decides to tentatively rejoin the mathematics game with the dreamy guy who usurped her supervision spot at the college, falling in love with him (shock) along the way. Cue the equations scrawled on the walls and nights ended snoozing on half-written A4s with her tuba-playing beau. Far from the teeth-bared role she had her breakthrough with in Julia Ducournau’s “Raw”, Ella Rumpf’s Marguerite is a subdued presence with all the jagged desirability of an isosceles triangle. The distaste for “Marguerite’s Theorem,” though, arrives when this autistic-coded character’s awkward blunders are played for laughs, from her unusual seduction methods to her sincere and deadpan line delivery. That’s before you’re even introduced to Noa, her ‘hip’ roommate who errs dangerously toward the trope whereby a white protagonist recognizes their faults or gets out of trouble thanks to the help of a Black friend. The entire thing, essentially, has the exact same plot mechanics as “Save the Last Dance,” if Julia Stiles was a mathlete instead of a ballerina.Novion crafts a handsome film, if one emotionally kneecapped by its grand thesis that gifted kids are gifted after all — and while Jacques Girault does some fine DP work, one can’t help but feel weary at the lame visuals of math equations swirling around Marguerite, not unlike a meme we all know and love. Our protagonist does evolve into an oddly plucky and ultimately lovable figure who succeeds at using her passion to put “order to infinity,” but the whole thing feels undermined when the movie suggests she needs a male love interest to help her find herself.It’s a story that pins its results on a timeworn formula, a movie where you can predict every next scene, development and contention with the precision of Pythagoras’ theorem. Rumpf is solid and the story doesn’t lag, per se; but given the richesse of the Cannes slate this year and the proliferation of originality coming from French directorial talent this year, “Marguerite’s Theorem” is destined to fade like chalk on slate.“Marguerite’s Theorem” premiered in Special Screenings at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "title": "Todd Haynes Says His Gay Romance Starring Joaquin Phoenix ‘Will Be an NC-17 Film’",
        "content": "Joaquin Phoenix‘s apparent mission to work with all the best contemporary independent filmmakers is about to continue. Following his highly acclaimed Ari Aster collaboration “Beau Is Afraid,” the Oscar winner is teaming up with Todd Haynes on a new original love story.Speaking to IndieWire’s Eric Kohn during a conversation at the American Pavilion at the Cannes Film Festival, Haynes teased that he is plotting a variety of upcoming projects in the film and television spaces. Notably, the auteur revealed that he and Phoenix co-developed a period gay romance with frequent Kelly Reichardt collaborator Jonathan Raymond that Haynes plans to shoot as his next film.“All I can do is just keep hunkering down and committing to each project,” Haynes said when asked about the differences between working in film and television. “I have more features planned. I have also episodic projects coming that are planned, that are really exciting. I’m going back to work with Kate Winslet with something she brought me for HBO. The next film is a feature that’s an original script that I developed with Joaquin Phoenix based on some thoughts and ideas he brought to me. We basically wrote with him as a story writer. Me and Jon Raymond and Joaquin share the story credit. And we hope to be shooting it beginning early next year. It’s a gay love story set in 1930s LA.”Phoenix has a reputation as an artist who embraces extremes, and Haynes said that their collaboration won’t shy away from portraying adult subject matter.“Joaquin was pushing me further and going ‘no, let’s go further,'” he said. “This will be an NC-17 film.”The project will certainly be welcome news to admirers of Haynes’ distinct brand of queer period cinema after films like “Carol,” “Poison,” and “Velvet Goldmine.” But while they wait for cameras to roll on that film, the directors’ fans can look forward to his Cannes hit “May December.” The film stars Julianne Moore and Natalie Portman as a formerly scandalized teacher and the actress who connects with her as she prepares to play her in an independent film. Critics have praised the project for combining many of Haynes’ signature motifs with a campy sense of humor.“A heartbreakingly sincere piece of high camp that teases real human drama from the stuff of tabloid sensationalism,” IndieWire’s David Ehrlich wrote in his Cannes review. “Todd Haynes’ delicious ‘May December’ continues the director’s tradition of making films that rely upon the self-awareness that seems to elude their characters — especially the ones played by Julianne Moore.”Reporting by Eric Kohn.",

        "title": "‘Club Zero’ Review: Mia Wasikowska Teaches Her Students to Stop Eating in a Badly Miscalculated Satire",
        "content": "If nothing else, every new Jessica Hausner film makes an increasingly undeniable case that no other narrative director is more skeptical of — or even hostile towards — the social institutions into which people entrust their faith. Her first and still only great movie confronted that subject head-on by telling the story of a wheelchair-bound woman whose multiple sclerosis appears to be cured by a visit to the Catholic sanctuary of Lourdes. Alas, both of the contemporary-set films she’s made since focus on more distinctly modern sources of faith, and both of those films are undone by her distinctly modern failure to distinguish good faith from bad. In 2019’s “Little Joe,” Hausner questioned the world’s growing reliance on pharmaceuticals with an “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” riff that likened antidepressants to a dehumanizing alien force. With the equally glib but even less explicable “Club Zero,” she returns with a Pied Piper-inspired dark comedy about the potential dangers of placing too much confidence in our children’s school teachers. You know, the real villains of the 21st century. Of course, there’s nothing inherently wrong with making a film on that or any subject; much better ones have been mined from similar concerns, often in response to DeSantis-like despots who regard classrooms as the frontline of their fascist-minded culture war. But Hausner somehow manages to twist a wry satire of Instagram “wellness” and Gen Z’s zero-sum approach to the world’s problems into a seemingly inadvertent broadside against the very people she claims should be “the most respected members of society.”It’s always been hard not to admire Hausner’s audacity, but this time around the boldness of her storytelling finally spills into trollish provocation. Sorry, I’m burying the lede: “Club Zero” is a movie about a new teacher at an English boarding school named Ms. Novak (played by a frighteningly self-convinced Mia Wasikowska), whose cult-like lesson plan hinges on convincing her students that food is actually bad for them. All food. “There’s more in you,” she tells her small clutch of teenage students, which proves to be the first step in manipulating them to put less into themselves. Ms. Novak’s curriculum starts with “conscious eating,” which is a bit woo woo but otherwise sensible enough. Things quickly begin to escalate from there, however, as Ms. Novak casually preys upon her students’ personal insecurities in order to sell them on a plant-based “mono diet” and then a full-blown abstinence from all food. Did you know that hundreds, and possibly even thousands of people around the world have discovered the health benefits and general enlightenment that can be achieved by not eating? Yeah, they’re just keeping the secret to themselves because mainstream society isn’t ready for that kind of truth bomb. The heightened reality of Hausner’s film — a stiff and angular dimension that evokes the dry giallo of a Peter Strickland film even before “The Duke of Burgundy” star Sidse Babett Knudsen shows up as the school headmistress — helps to disguise some of the more logical problems with this premise. Not only do the kids in Ms. Novak’s appear to have no other friends (it’s never implied they were selected for their insecurities), but they seem wholly uninterested in sex, social media, or any sort of engagement with the outside world, despite the fact that all of them own cell phones. From the pink varnish on the vending machine at school to the Lanthimos-like cruelty the characters use to shame each other into compliance, every detail in “Club Zero” is glazed with the self-insistent mirth of an unfunny satire that bites off a whole lot more than it’s willing to chew.Along with the percussive twang of Markus Binder’s score, which supports almost every major beat in the movie with an extra comic pop, the two-tone surreality of Hausner’s set and costume design also works to ensure that impressionable audiences don’t take “Club Zero” too literally. The film is still destined to be labeled as “dangerous,” but its various buffers and backstops start to become all the more important once it begins to seem like Ms. Novak might be onto something. Fred (Luke Barker), the shy ballet dancer whose mom and dad work in Ghana, suddenly moves with newfound grace. Elsa (Ksenia Devriendt), the bulimic girl whose rich parents feel more typical of the film’s student body, develops a new level of confidence. The scholarship kid’s grades go up, the gymnast is able to jump higher on the trampoline, and the over-involved parents who found Ms. Novak on the internet are happy enough with the results of her class — at least until something wholly unrelated triggers a sudden come-to-Jesus moment. A parent herself, Hausner is clearly being critical of the conditional involvement that all of these busy moms and dads take in their children’s lives, but she’s far more compelled by the mind-altering effect that certain institutions can have on people. By acknowledging the ridiculousness of Ms. Novak’s curriculum at the same time as it underscores the newfound sense of personal control her students derive from their collective eating disorder (which is horrifying, and never funny enough to justify turning it into a joke), “Club Zero” is free to take cheap shots at the supposed groupthink of youth culture without even bothering to identify its target. I suppose, in spite of the faux-timelessness of its aesthetic, that “Club Zero” could be justified as a modern fairy tale about a world in which radicalization is threatening to become a new requirement of personal identity, but doing so would require you to ignore that self-denial is a trope as old as religion itself. It would also distract from the reality of a movie that doesn’t have any idea of where to place its blame. Are overworked parents the problem? Are school teachers brainwashing our kids? Or are today’s uncompromisingly progressive teens at unique risk of having their ideals get weaponized against them? None of these things are mutually exclusive, but all of them are poorly articulated here. It’s one thing for Hausner to question religion, which has been responsible for all manner of sins over the centuries, but antidepressants — and now educators — feel like cynical targets for a filmmaker desperate to undermine anything that might help people better prepare themselves for the difficulties of a godless world. I want to have faith that I’m misreading Hausner’s intentions, and possibly not for the first time, but I’m getting pretty exhausted by the lack of faith she seems to have in everyone else.“Club Zero” premiered in Competition at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "content": "Kieran Culkin is already having reservations about his first post-“Succession” role.Culkin is set to star in Jesse Eisenberg‘s sophomore directorial effort “A Real Pain,” which follows two cousins, played by Culkin and Eisenberg, who travel to Poland after their grandmother’s death and end up joining a Holocaust tour.During an Interview magazine discussion with Taika Waititi, Culkin admitted to trying to “get out” of the indie project due to its filming location. Culkin cited the issue of traveling with his young family as a reason not to do the film but credited Eisenberg’s moving semi-autobiographical script as a film he could not turn down.“This is going to sound terrible, but I’ve tried to get out of it because it’s going to make my life miserable. But I don’t want to not do it because it’s such a beautiful script,” Culkin said. “I was finding every reason to not do it. I was like, ‘I’ll watch his first film [“When You Finish Saving the World”], maybe it’s going to be terrible.’ I watched it, and I was like, ‘Shit. It’s really good.'”Culkin continued, “Well, let me reread the script, I’m going to find holes in it. Maybe I was in a good mood when I said yes to it. I reread it and it was so wonderful. When I finished it, I went to my wife and I was like, ‘I’m sorry, honey. Fuck, I have to go do this movie.’ It’s just too good.”The “Succession” actor added of the premise of Eisenberg’s film, “It’s based on, I guess, what happened in his life. He and I play cousins and our great-aunt has died. Our great-aunt who dies is a Holocaust survivor in the movie, and in her will, she’s given us a trip to go see the town where she was born and the house she grew up in.”He revealed, “The reason I wanted to get out of it is I have a 1 1⁄2-year-old and a 3 1⁄2-year-old, and we’re going to be bouncing around Poland. I don’t like being away from them for more than two days at a time, and it’s not practical for me to have them there the whole time. I’m working on trying to convince my wife to come out for two weeks and bring the kids. It’s just a lot on her. We do have a nanny here, but she can’t travel with us. So she’s doing that all herself, and she really earns her half of what it is I do for a living. Except sometimes that can be like, ‘Look, there’s a nice paycheck here, so let’s work really hard.’ And sometimes, like this, I’m like, ‘This is for me, I want to do it, and you get nothing out of this except hard work.’ It’s a hard sell.”Culkin also opened up about his sustaining hopes for a fifth season of “Succession,” despite creator Jesse Armstrong announcing the current fourth season as its final installment.“I always thought five seasons. It was just a number I had in my head,” Culkin said. “This season is very, very different, which is exciting, but makes me feel like, ‘Couldn’t there be a five, now that the show is kind of different?’ I want to see what else happens. And there very well could be. Jesse knows that.”",

        "content": "Jeremy Allen White wanted to say “no, chef” when it came to consuming his mega-meals ahead of wrestling biopic “The Iron Claw.”White stars as wrestler Kerry Von Erich, aka the Texas Tornado, in the upcoming A24 film. Zac Efron plays the lead role of titular WWE Hall of Famer Kevin Von Erich, with Harris Dickinson, Lily James, Holt McCallany, and Maura Tierney also appearing in Sean Durkin’s film charting the wrestling dynasty of the Von Erich family.To beef up to play the Texas Tornado, White said he was committed to a “gross” high-protein diet.“[I was] eating all the time. Like, never stopping,” the “Bear” star told Esquire. “In the morning, I would have waffles, almond butter. In the middle of the day, I was eating turkey patties and avocado all the time. It’s really just gross. You’re trying to consume as much as you possibly can, and, to be honest, you don’t feel great. I was training as well, but, I don’t know, trying to get that big, it’s no way to live.”White added that co-star Efron is a “maniac” when it came to the physical transformation for the role.“He’s so focused and knowledgeable on training, diet, all that. In terms of a physical transformation, I think he kind of blew us all out of the water,” White said. “He looks really amazing in this thing.”The “Shameless” alum teased that the wrestling biopic is “so interesting, bonkers, and sad” when it comes to the downfall of the Von Erichs.“I was a fan of wrestling, but I didn’t know the story of the Von Erichs,” White said. “[Director] Sean did a beautiful job. He’s been a fan of wrestling and the Von Erichs since he was a kid, and so I feel like he understands the story so intimately that he had a really nice perspective on it. And it was a blast to work with Zac and Harris.”White previously told GQ that Efron sent him a “really lovely note” before production which read: “Get training, eat, keep doing what you’re doing, stay hard.” White attempted to put on 40 pounds of muscle for the role, with Efron similarly undergoing a staggering transformation to play Kevin Von Erich.",

        "content": "Melissa McCarthy is opening up about enduring a toxic workplace.The “Little Mermaid” actress recalled being on a “volatile, hostile set” that left her “physically ill” due to the allegedly manipulative behavior exhibited by those in charge. McCarthy said she eventually stood up to the problematic leader after multiple people were fired and others left “weeping.”“I did work for someone once who ran such a volatile, hostile set that it made me physically ill,” McCarthy told The Guardian. “My eyes were swelling up, I was absorbing all of this nuttiness.”She continued, “There were people weeping, visibly so upset by this one person. And I think that’s why the manipulation worked, because to get to me, this person would fire people I loved, which kept me quiet. It was very effective.”The “Nine Perfect Strangers” star added, “Then one day, I was like, ‘It stops today!’ I just kept saying to them, ‘It stops, it stops.’ And I know now I’ll never keep quiet again.”McCarthy and her husband, producing partner Ben Falcone, founded production company called On the Day with one rule for sets: the “demand” for kindness.“You know, we were so astounded and grateful at getting to build our own little worlds, we were like, ‘We have to build the one we’ve always talked about, where everybody gets to have an opinion and everyone is really nice. It’s going to run a lot better with no screamers or crazy egos bumbling around. Why would we risk destroying that?'” McCarthy said.The “Ghostbusters” actress noted, though, that “it’s a fist fight to try to get comedies made right now” despite the need for laughter in the current state of the world.“I don’t know why, because we’ve never needed to laugh more,” she said. “Comedy allows you to sit next to somebody whose ideas don’t match up. And maybe you come out a little closer. I think that’s what I’m supposed to be doing, in this world. I can’t do a lot of useful things. I don’t know how to clean up the oceans, or stop our violent tendencies. But I can hopefully give someone who’s had a bad day an hour and a half to go into a different world where bills or illness isn’t the top thing on their brain. That’s the only skill set I really have. So I have to keep trying.”McCarthy recently voiced her desire to revisit the breakout comedy “Bridesmaids” as soon as possible.“That group of women was the most magical thing ever. Almost all of us were really good friends already. I think it was such a magical time,” McCarthy said of the 2011 film co-starring Maya Rudolph, Kristen Wiig, and Rose Byrne. “I would do a ‘Bridesmaids’ sequel this afternoon, right now.”",

        "content": "It’s been two years since “The French Dispatch” hit theaters, but the wait for a new Wes Anderson movie is almost over. “Asteroid City,” the auteur’s science fiction-twinged 11th film, premieres in competition at the Cannes Film Festival this week before expanding into theaters nationwide next month. To mark the occasion, Focus Features has released a new clip that shows some of the film’s incredible ensemble cast in action.“Asteroid City” sees Anderson returning to the midcentury setting of “Moonrise Kingdom” to tell the story of a fictional desert town hosting an annual “Junior Stargazer and Space Cadets” convention on “Asteroid Day.” The local holiday commemorates the day that a meteor struck the town’s location in 3,007 B.C.Like “The French Dispatch,” “Asteroid City” uses an anthology format to tell three overlapping stories. Tom Hanks stars as a grieving father who finds himself stranded in Asteroid City with his adult children due to an extraterrestrial occurrence at the astronomy festival. The new clip shows Hanks, Liev Schreiber, and Hope Davis being held hostage by local security forces. They debate the legalities of leaving and the threat of aliens before Hanks’ character uses the captivity as an opportunity to do some flirting.In addition to Hanks, Schreiber, and Davis, “Asteroid City” stars Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson, Jason Schwartzman, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Adrien Brody, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Bryan Cranston, Hong Chau, Steve Carell, Maya Hawke, Matt Dillon, and Sophia Lillis. The script was written by Anderson and his regular collaborator Roman Coppola, with whom he wrote “The Darjeeling Limited,” “Moonrise Kingdom,” “Isle of Dogs,” and “The French Dispatch.”“Asteroid City” is the first of two Wes Anderson movies set to premiere in 2023. His next animated project, the Roald Dahl adaptation “The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,” is set to be released by Netflix later this year. The stop motion film, which features the voice talents of Benedict Cumberbatch, Dev Patel, and Ben Kingsley, is part of Netflix’s larger effort to turn its recent acquisition of the Dahl estate into a new series of film and television projects.“Asteroid City” opens in select theaters on Friday, June 16 before expanding nationwide on June 23.

        "title": "‘The Settlers’ Review: A Chilean ‘Killers of the Flower Moon’ Companion Piece",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. MUBI releases the film in select theaters on Friday, January 12.In Budd Boetticher’s 1959 parable of how we remember violence, “Ride Lonesome,” Randolph Scott confronts the man who killed his wife at the very spot where he murdered her. “That was a long time ago,” the killer said. “I’d almost forgot.” Scott’s reply? “A man can do that.”So too can a society. Especially when it’s all too convenient to forget things so unpleasant they may shake our very sense of identity. Felipe Galvez’s Chilean Western “The Settlers” may remind some viewers of a Boetticher film when they’re watching it: following three men on horseback on a cross-country journey, it dramatizes questions of identity and belonging, and how these things can be written in violence. Most Boetticher-like, in a tight 98 minutes “The Settlers” says more than a lot of films double its length. It’s one of the most chilling art-Westerns to come along in some time, as provocative for its ideas, dialogue, and characterizations, as for the beauty of its empty landscapes.It’s the turn of the last century. A wealthy landowner who’s bought up most of Tierra del Fuego, Jose Menendez (a real-life historical figure, whose descendants own much of the land there today), recruits the Scottish military man who manages his security to assemble what men he needs and embark on a mission to exterminate the Indigenous Selk’nam people on his land. The Scot, MacLennan (Mark Stanley), only wants one to accompany him: a mixed-race mestizo, of Indigenous descent himself, Segundo (Camilo Arancibia), who’s barely out of his teenage years. Menendez (Alfredo Castro) isn’t having that, however. The landowner insists that MacLennan also take Bill (Benjamin Westfall), a wily Texan with a strong drawl and a big rep. “Look at him,” Menendez says, pointing to Segundo. “And look at Bill.” Menendez was never going to let MacLennan take only a part-Indigenous boy to kill other Indigenous people.They set out on their journey across Tierra del Fuego, across landscapes that look more like Iceland than what one typically thinks of as South America. MacLennan, a boisterous boor still wearing his slightly tattered redcoat from the Queen’s army, where he claims he was a lieutenant, is prone to bursting out into song and boasting about what he’s capable of. On one occasion in Egypt, or perhaps the Transvaal, he and his men ate his horse to fend off starvation. “Aww, you can’t eat your horse,” Bill says, acting at times like a caricature of an Old Hollywood cowboy. “That’s like eating a friend.”That a moment of such relative levity and character-building could then be followed by the chilling scene of their actual massacre of the Selk’nam, and a horrifying moment when MacLennan tries to get Segundo to rape one of the Indigenous women, shows a remarkable ability to switch from one tone to another. Galvez understands that inhuman acts can be committed by people who actually seem quite human at other moments — this is not just a monochromatic landscape of horror — and maybe that’s even more disturbing. Segundo is the one character who remains mostly silent, the film’s observer character and, in a way, moral center, even as complicit as he is in the slaughter himself.Galvez has constructed a picaresque journey film built around the three travelers meeting different people along the way. That you get such a sense of who everyone is, in addition to depicting the terror of the genocide against the Selk’nam, is a balancing of intimate and epic you wouldn’t expect from a first-time filmmaker. But Galvez, making his feature debut, somehow pulls it off. That he doesn’t underline his points, and leaves certain parts of the story ambiguous, is all the more impressive. He’s made a message movie that isn’t a message movie. And as beautiful as many of the images are, some compositions shot like Dutch Masters paintings by cinematographer Simone D’Arcangelo, it never comes across like Indigenous suffering is just the fodder for art.“The Settlers,” for all its artistry, is also a deeply felt work of activism with a message that needs to be heard in Chile. Just as nothing about the Pinochet coup in 1973 or the resulting dictatorship is taught in Chilean schools today, so is nothing about the genocide of the Selk’nam, a culture that is considered extinct, with only one living person today able to speak their language.Galvez’s film will likely be controversial in its home country in a way that another film, also debuting at Cannes 2023, won’t be in its own: Martin Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon.” The genocide and displacement of Native Americans is more widely taught in the U.S., but Scorsese’s film also illuminates a particular slice of that history that many viewers may be unfamiliar with. Each of these movies is arriving from very different places — one a debut film, the other from an old master, one made for very little, the other for around $200 million. Hopefully, the attention “Killers” gets will rub off on “The Settlers,” which could use it. This is a film that shows that, as easy as it is to forget about the past, it’s easier still when it was never taught in the first place.“The Settlers” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.",

        "title": "Martin Scorsese on Scrapping the Original ‘Killers of the Flower Moon’ Script: ‘It’s Not a Whodunnit, It’s Who Didn’t Do It’",
        "content": "After years of anticipation, Martin Scorsese‘s long awaited “Killers of the Flower Moon” finally premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday. The film, which tells the story of the Reign of Terror that saw a number of wealthy Osage Nation members murdered in the 1920s, had been a passion project of Scorsese’s for years before he began filming in 2021. Production was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, but there were also significant creative changes that stalled the project.Scorsese and his co-writer Eric Roth initially envisioned the film as a procedural that followed the FBI investigation into the murders. But the creative team soon realized that the movie needed to place the Osage Nation front and center.Speaking to the press following the film’s Cannes premiere, Scorsese — flanked by his cast members Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone — recalled the lengthy development process and the moment that he knew the script had to be reworked.“We touched upon it after having myself and Eric Roth and all of us together trying to get the story expressed from the point of view of the Bureau of Investigation coming in,” Scorsese said. “And I said ‘I think the audience is ahead of us. They know it’s not a whodunnit, it’s who didn’t do it.”Scorsese explained that DiCaprio was eventually slated to play FBI agent Tom White, the role that eventually went to Jesse Plemons. But both DiCaprio and Scorsese soon realized that the human story of the way the murders impacted the Osage people was more interesting than the procedural aspects of the book.“At one point, after two years of working on the script, Leo came to me. And he was going to play Tom White, that Jesse plays, and said to me ‘where’s the heart of this story? And I had had some meetings with the Osage,” he said. “And I learned a lot about them in those three hours. I learned about the people that settled, and the stories. They’re all related to each other, and there’s still relations and there’s still issues and so-and-so is in love… and it goes on like that. And I said ‘there’s the story.’Once they settled on a new perspective, Scorsese says the decision to bring Gladstone’s Mollie Burkhart into the foreground and cast DiCaprio as her villainous husband Ernest was a natural one.“The story is in the character that the least is written about,” he said. “Ernest. And of course, that’s what Leo wanted to do. He said let’s try to find where Ernest is and let’s create Ernest as a template of that tragedy of love and trust and betrayal of the Indigenous people.”",

        "title": "‘Anatomy of a Fall’ Review: Sandra Hüller May or May Not Be a Murderer in Chilly Palme d’Or-Winning Drama",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Neon releases the film in select theaters on Friday, October 13.They say trends come in threes. And so, nipping on the heels of Alice Diop’s “Saint Omer” and Cedric Kahn’s Directors’ Fortnight breakout “The Goldman Case,” Justine Triet’s “Anatomy of a Fall” make a compelling case that the courthouse has become the most fertile ground in contemporary French cinema, offering incisive auteurs both motive and opportunity to put social structures on trial. As it calls the institution of marriage to the stand, Triet’s piercing film, which went on to win the Palme d’Or at this year’s Cannes, holds the ambient tensions and illogical loose ends of domestic life against the harsh and rational light of a legal system that searches for order in chaos.Rounding out her own impressive hat trick, “Toni Erdmann” and “The Zone of Interest” star Sandra Hüller dazzles in a role clearly written with the performer in mind. She plays Sandra, a German-born, France-based bisexual novelist accused of killing her male partner in a way eerily foretold by one of her novels. And if that description calls to mind another icy-blond (in a performance, incidentally, that also shook the Cannes Film Festival, back in 1992), the echo is both wholly intentional and entirely irrelevant. Indeed, “Anatomy of a Fall” is filled with such anti-portents — coincidences or clues, depending who you ask, echoes or empty noise, depending on who’s listening.In other words, the film deals in uncertainty, so let’s stick with the facts. One wintry morning, high in the French Alps, Samuel (Samuel Theis, notice a trend?) is found dead on the ground outside his house. The cause of death is acute head trauma, that much is clear, but forensics cannot indicate if said trauma occurred before or after a three-story fall. And what about that fall, or was it a push, or was it a ju— ah, we’re slipping again, so back to straight facts: Sandra was the only other person in the house, and tension was in the air.They fought the previous night, before bickering from a distance earlier that morning, as Samuel — himself a frustrated novelist — drowned out and surreptitiously ended a flirtatious interview between his more successful wife and a fawning grad student. (His murder weapon to kill the interview? An instrumental, calypso remix of “P.I.M.P.” blasted at full volume. A cherished favorite or a misogynistic micro-aggression? That’s for the lawyers to decide!)Or, more to the point, for the jury, and for the viewers themselves. Triet, however, isn’t about to tip her hat. Refining a sideplot from her (wonderful) 2016 comedy “In Bed with Victoria” — which follows a lawyer whose personal life is in shambles as she deftly wins a case for a defendant whose innocence is ever in doubt — Triet once again plays with judicial frameworks, not moral ones, painting in shades of gray by leaving Sandra’s innocence an open and lingering question. Whereas the filmmaker’s earlier work tracked legal dispassion and personal collapse along parallel narrative tracks, “Anatomy of a Fall” overlays them to devastating effect, surpassing the modest pleasures of a cerebral whodunnit by recognizing that the family tragedy is the same no matter what.Bearing the brunt of that tragedy is Sandra’s son, Daniel (Milo Machado Graner). Blind since a childhood accident that left his parents’ marriage with scars that would never fully fade, the roughly 10-year-old boy goes from quiet witness to the ultimate, heart-wrenching victim of the larger trial. At first, the boy and his mother are united under the same roof, sharing a liminal grief made literal as an unfinished chalet turned crime-scene — a broken house that can never again be a home, as it remains fixed-in-time at the worst moment of their entire lives. Police rifle through, taking pictures, cordoning off rooms, and turning yesterday’s dirty laundry haphazardly cast on the ground into tomorrow’s legal evidence.But soon their perspectives diverge, first as the prosecution (embodied by “BPM” star Antoine Reinartz) casts doubt on Sandra, and then as the defense (played by “By the Grace of God” breakout Swann Arlaud) turns the tables on the dead man himself, settling on a legal strategy to try Samuel for his own death. Whoever wins, the boy loses, and as his perspective gradually assumes greater narrative attention, the film’s chilly mien grows colder and colder and soon begins to burn.  Triet co-wrote the script with Arthur Harrari, who is himself the acclaimed filmmaker behind “Onoda: 10,000 Nights in the Jungle,” the star of “The Goldman Case,” and — it would be remiss not to mention — Triet’s real-life spouse. I only bring this up because metafiction (or autofiction, as the French call it) plays an integral part of the plot. Sandra has ascended the literary ranks by mining her life for material, and her late husband had just started doing the same at the time of his demise. The discovery of Samuel’s hidden audio files recording the couple’s most heated disputes — including one from the night before his death — could seem like manna from heaven for an eager prosecution while just as easily opening wider questions about the very act of introspection. If you’re really committed to airing dirty laundry, won’t you instinctively go for the stinkiest socks?     Sandra has made an implicit promise with her readers that her fiction contains hints of truth, but then, what artist has not? Though passages imagining spousal murder threaten to convict the film’s protagonist in the court of public opinion well before a verdict is reached, they also dovetail with Triet and Harrari’s larger thematic concerns. “Anatomy of a Fall” is never really about the trial, and doesn’t only explore the chasm between empiricism and emotion; at its searing best, the film tracks family destruction with cold precision.If an artist relies on memories, why not also share nightmares? Why not build a polar vortex that crushes fact under fiction, that lifts from last night’s argument, today’s viewing of a ’90s classic and tomorrow’s worst fears? A cyclone that sends the mind soaring, and primes the heart for a hefty fall. “Anatomy of a Fall” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.",

        "title": "‘Banel & Adama’ Review: Star-Crossed Lovers Are Blamed for Drought in Gorgeous Senegalese Debut",
        "content": "There is a sultry elusiveness to Ramata-Toulaye Sy’s debut feature that makes it hard to articulate its subject or even its genre. Is this a riff on “Romeo & Juliet”, filtered through Senegalese village life? Or is it a sci-fi fable, with the mirage-like heat reflecting a slow descent into personal madness a la Lars von Trier’s “Melancholia”? “Banel & Adama” is a striking debut that puts Sy on the map as a purveyor of deceptively gorgeous visions that show flimsy desires at the mercy of the social, and literal, weather. A drought can suck dry the fiercest emotional bonds, so what use is romantic love when people are dying of heat?We hear their names first, as intimate whispers repeat, “Banel and Adama,” and DP Amine Berrada films dancing sunbeams that refract into mysterious shapes. We then see a piece of paper with their names written down together, over and over, ad infinitum, before being told in voice-over about a girl who drowned in a river, apparently lured by sirens. Then we see Banel (Khady Mane) and Adama (Mamadou Diallo) blissing out in the sparkling water. There are no sirens, only teenagers in love, although a tone has been set whereby collective superstition and individual freedoms live side-by-side with neither one weighed over the other, save for the fact that we are in Banel’s head. After Banel’s first husband died by falling down an open well, Muslim tradition decreed that his younger brother, Adama, marry the widow — a stroke of luck as this is a true love marriage. The pair do not wish to ever be apart and Berrada’s vivid impressionistic images convey a heightened universe of two people living in a sacred way. “I loved as a woman can,” Banel reveals as sunlight twinkles and dances. The combination of ethereal voiceover with nature at its most breathtaking evokes our cinema’s philosophical high priest, Terrence Malick.Banel dreams of living with Adama in a house in the dunes. These dune houses are submerged in sand and progress to dig them out is Banel’s measure of how close they are to happiness. Yet, traditions in this small Islamic village threaten to stall their scheme. Adama is next in line to be village chief. When he refuses the role and does not turn up to prayers, his failure to do so, and by extension his romance with Banel, is held responsible when a drought persists, causing livestock and, eventually, people to die. Sy softens the motives of would-be antagonists by filming everyone with an eye for their beauty and belonging to this setting. As her mother (Binta Racine Sy) lectures Banel about the importance of Adama stepping up and of Banel behaving in a more classically feminine way, her cyan dress pops against a burnt sienna wall. Each shot is held for just long enough to feel the enrapturing pull of a compelling image, but not for so long that the story engine lags. A languorous pacing is established so that it is a pleasure to be in this world, even as Sy’s purposeful confidence plants the question of what this beauty is hiding. The ways in which Banel & Adama are at odds with the villagers is slowly dropped into daily vignettes under a sun that makes it hard to tell tears apart from sweat. Firstly their schedules are rent asunder, so that she is dispatched to do laundry while he herds animals. Sy shoots Banel alone, sitting staring at the sea with her head framed by a laurel of tree branches, or motionless inside a tent encased in mosquito netting. By contrast the villagers work in a rhythm with one another, so that in one scene they are using farming instruments in perfect synchronization, in another they are a tableaux. Adama appears less frequently as the sense of impending doom facing the village becomes more pronounced. Dead animals litter the film, some of these are on Banel who has a murderous little habit of firing her slingshot at birds and lizards, only to later incinerate their bodies in a fire. As Adama slips out of the purview, the portrait of Banel becomes more volatile. She hallucinates and screams at a tiny boy, Malik, who has a habit of writing everything down. It is suggested that he is a “scribe angel” — someone who can read others’ thoughts. The greatest accomplishment here is there is no primacy between one version of events or another. Banel isn’t so much an unreliable narrator as she is the star of a fever dream where symbolism and reality meld. This being so — perhaps the villagers are right, perhaps her relationship with Adama did prevent the rains from falling, perhaps love is a selfish force that puts one at a remove from collective needs. Sy does not provide a definitive interpretation, conducting her images at a level of opaque remove, letting the dramatic emotions and weather conditions set a temperature of their own mysterious making. “Banel & Adama” premiered In Competition at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "title": "‘Four Daughters’ Review: Metafictional Doc About Family of Girls Who Joined ISIS Is Powerful and Perverse",
        "content": "It’s easy to get trapped in circuitous arguments surrounding documentary ethics at the best of times, but Kaouther Ben Hania’s metafictional “Four Daughters” — involving young children, abuse, trauma and re-enactments — appears to chart these knotty waters as a barefaced challenge. This Tunisian entry into Cannes’ Official Competition is a bold behemoth of an undertaking, which is veiled, unveiled and then re-veiled with endless angles and perspectives; it’s a veritable snakepit of uneasy decisions that grips you with its novel approach to so-called truth-telling before lapsing into something a little more conventional. Far from a gamble made in the service of naturalism, this heightened and strange piece of fiction re-enactment exposes itself for critique in a way that you almost have to respect. For its sins, it seems to —just about— succeed. “Four Daughters” orbits the trauma of a Tunisian woman named Olfa and her youngest daughters, Tayssir and Eya. Some years ago Olfa’s two eldest daughters, Rahma and Ghofrane, left to join ISIS — or, as this documentary posits, were “devoured by the wolf.” Filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania, never seen but often heard from her safe space behind the camera, decides to re-tell the story of how this came to be. She makes the frequently fascinating and morally murky decision to hire two actors, Nour Karoui and Ichraq Matar, to play Rahma and Ghofrane respectively. Similarly, well-known Tunisian Egyptian actor Hend Sabry is on hand to play Olfa in scenes where the real-life mother might become too upset, overcome or uncomfortable. It is a documentary about radicalization and the transference of shame, both in the familial and religious sense; it’s equally concerned with the trauma that passes through bloodlines where family trees have strangling roots, especially because of the poison of state-sanctioned gendered violence and extreme religious dogma. Olfa is rarely repentant about her rigid views, often accusing her young daughters as behaving like whores for the slightest transgression and espousing that she wishes she had sons because she hates girls and their sinful bodies. There is equal love and venom between them all: at some points they laugh and embrace, while at others, her daughters reveal details of violence and psychological damage from their upbringing, Eya stating that she once wished to strangle her mother in retaliation. “I taught them to aim,” Olfa says, “and they shot me.”Throughout the runtime, you find yourself actively tussling with the integrity of the project. Tayssir and Eya are young, and they frequently get upset, their soulful chestnut eyes boring a question mark into your critical faculties. This may well be a way for the family to work through their grief — though the filmic intention is never spelled out by the family, nor the filmmaker — but even if so, it plays out like an extended family therapy session for its vulnerable subjects, screened in competition of the world’s most famous film festival for the world to see. It’s heartbreaking and often masterful to watch, but, at what cost?It’s not just the real-life subjects and the age of those involved that twangs at the conscience, but the actors, too. One particularly tormenting scene involves Eya confronting her abusive stepfather, played by Majd Mastoura — the actor becomes overwhelmed and asks for the cameras to be cut, only for the ‘real’ cameras to continue rolling. Eya, somewhat annoyed, says: “This film lets me speak out. For him, it’s just dialogue. He’s an actor.” Frequently actors Karoui, Matar and Sabry become similarly upset, or lapse into unscripted arguments or debates with the family that involve the departed sisters’ motives or the cruelty of Olfa’s parenting. In one heartbreaking moment, Olfa asks Matar: “would you be happy to have me as a mother?”. Matar falters and then is saved by someone else jumping in, while a look crosses her face that seems to say: Am I being paid enough for this?One could debate the ethics of this thing for years; for every argument (“she says this is helping her work through her trauma!”), there is a counterpoint (“she’s too young to provide real consent!”). Ben Hania makes similarly divisive stylistic decisions: strong lighting and unnatural framing evoke a layer of knowing artifice; whenever seated as a trio, Olfa hovers behind her daughters like a prison warden. The score swoons and swells, and there’s an awful lot of symbolism relating to doors and windows. But just like her uncomfortably brutal “Beauty and the Dogs” and Oscar-nominated “The Man Who Sold His Skin,” everything seems to coalesce in a way that feels like it’s all meant to be this way.“They say a cat is so afraid of her babies, that she eats them,” says Olfa, the documentary’s tragic figure, Medea, tyrant, and martyr. It might be hard to imagine two sisters leaving your family to become jihadist war brides, but it’s altogether more relatable to watch “Four Daughters” and come away thinking about what it means to be a good mother. “Four Daughters” premiered In Competition at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.

        "title": "‘The Breaking Ice’ Review: A Shimmering Love Triangle About Sad Hot People During a Chinese Winter",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Strand Releasing releases the film in New York City theaters on Friday, January 19 and in Los Angeles theaters on Friday, January 26.A sweet and shimmeringly beautiful film about how life can flow and then freeze and then thaw into something entirely new if you let it, Anthony Chen’s “The Breaking Ice” finds hope in the most frigid of places. In this case, that place is the small Chinese border city of Yanji during the depths of its endless winter, when people’s breath is as thick as the gray fumes that spew out of the factory smokestacks, and the snowy peak of Changbai Mountain looks closer to heaven than it does to Pyongyang. More than half a million people live there (many of them ethnic Koreans), but few of them seem to think of it as home. It’s as if they got stuck there on their way to somewhere else, and — in the wake of a pandemic that restricted travel and imperiled the economy — are still waiting to be defrosted. Still waiting for the warmth they need to become liquid again. The frigid soul of a “sad hot people” movie par excellence, Nana (an extraordinary Zhou Dongyu) has learned to fake the warmth she’s forgotten how to find in herself. By day she works as an effusively smiling tour guide who talks busloads of tourists through the same old spiel about local Yanji history, as if stuck in a time loop that only she can see. By night, Nana is a prickly ice queen who tears up the local dancefloors and seems to take a cold degree of pleasure in rebuffing the handsome and rangy Han Xiao (“The Wandering Earth” star Qu Chuxiao), whose Korean-Chinese family runs the restaurant where Nana ends her tours. And then — as so often happens in life — a suicidal guy in a sweater vest shows up out of nowhere and changes the temperature for everyone.We’re never told why Li Haofeng (a reserved but receptive Liu Haoran) looks over every ledge he can find as if he’s wondering if it might be the one, but the vagueness of his depression suits a film that’s far less focused on biographical details than it is on the broad floes of unspoken feeling that they harden into each winter. We know that Haofeng is a Shanghai-based finance type who’s come to Yanji for a friend’s wedding, we know that he chews on ice cubes as if he savors the sound of them cracking open in his mouth, and we know that he sees something about Nana — even from his perch on a rickety fire escape 20 feet off the ground — that inspires him to get on her bus rather than jump to his death, but his wispy goatee is just thick enough to hide a few secrets. Beautiful as Nana is, sex doesn’t seem all that high on Haofeng’s list of concerns. Maybe he’s just seduced by her cheerful enthusiasm, and then doubly so when he realizes that she’s able to fake it from scratch. Whatever the case, Haofeng’s attraction to Nana is as drifting and elemental as the rest of Chen’s film. Like so many of the people we meet in Yanji, Haofeng isn’t drawn to the city so much as he’s stranded there (Nana and Xiao take him in, and take him out, after Haofeng loses his phone and misses his flight home). He’s too numb from the cold to feel like he belongs anywhere else. A tell-tale symbol of the wealth that makes its owner such an odd duck among the decidedly blue-collar local population, Haofeng’s wrist watch stops working shortly after he arrives in Yanji, its hands forever stuck at 4:45am. So many of this movie’s scenes are set during those pre-dawn hours — pitched between the darkness of a long night and the possibility of a new day — that Haofeng’s watch hardly seems broken. And while Haofeng’s relative affluence is seldom mentioned aloud, his freedom to leave Yanji at any time adds a curious undercurrent to the fact that he chooses not to. Over the course of the long weekend that he, Xiao, and Nana spend drinking soju together and running through the snowdrifts, Haofeng’s decision to stay appears to remind his new friends about the liminality of their own lives, and that the borders they’ve imposed upon themselves are every bit as arbitrary and imagined as the one that separates China from North Korea. Haofeng literally shouts over that border in a scene that — in keeping with the spirit of Chen’s previous work (e.g. “Drift,” “Ilo Ilo”) — is too ethereal to be weighed down by the obviousness of its meaning. Here, the Singaporean director is something of an outsider himself, and he brings a palpable sense of passing through to a film in which spiritual freedom rubs up against purgatorial immobility. It’s amazing how fast youth can fester when it’s fenced in or denied its future, and “The Breaking Ice” percolates with the leftover energy of people whose collective life force simply won’t let them lie flat and give up.That energy expresses itself in a wide variety of ways. At its most exuberant, the three members of the film’s almost love triangle sprint through a bookstore in an explicit homage to “Jules and Jim” as Kin Leonn’s lovely score twinkles over the soundtrack. Later, they look for each other in a massive ice maze, happy to be lost for once. Elsewhere — late into one of those drunken nights where it feels like the world doesn’t exist beyond the room you’re in — Nana cries as Xiao plays a song on his guitar. She springs a leak whenever she feels emotion, melting every night and reconstituting herself every morning. Most of these scenes are hazy but immaculately well-handled, their blank spaces thick with unrealized dreams. Chen only stumbles when he tries to fill those blank spaces with firm details, as he does by giving Nana a simple backstory that makes her embittered surrender too literal for a story that better expresses itself through a less defined sense of longing (a late pivot towards allegory helps on that score). This raw and lingeringly sensitive film resonates more strongly when it’s lost in the ice maze than when it’s tracing its steps back to the entrance. “The Breaking Ice” sticks with you because it doesn’t lead its characters out of the maze, it just melts down the walls between them.“The Breaking Ice” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.",

        "title": "Roger Deakins Thinks ‘Kundun’ Is Scorsese’s Best Movie: ‘It’s a Tone Poem’",
        "content": "Roger Deakins‘ legendary cinematography career has seen him work with elite directors like the Coen Brothers, Sam Mendes, and Denis Villeneuve. In between those repeat collaborations, he even found time for a one-off project with Martin Scorsese.“Kundun,” Scorsese’s 1997 film about the 14th Dalai Lama, earned Deakins the third of his 16 Oscar nominations for Best Cinematography (he went on to win the award for “Blade Runner 2049” and “1917”). Appearing on a recent panel discussion at the 92nd Street Y moderated by Annette Insdorf, Deakins opened up about the experience of working with Scorsese and why he thinks “Kundun” is the auteur’s masterpiece.“I believe Marty usually does storyboards but on ‘Kundun,’ he just annotated the script with his ideas, what the camera is going to do,” Deakins said. “He would draw a wide shot or a tracking shot with little stick figures. He gave us a copy of that and said, ‘This is the basis of what we’re working on for “Kundun.”’ Marty’s got a more defined vision of what he wants. But it was really done with his notations in the script, so in terms of setting the shot, I haven’t got a lot of flexibility. The kind of technical input you have on something like ‘1917’ compared with “Kundun,” which is much more simply shot… We had long conversations about the style of it. It’s a tone poem, which is why I love the film. I do think it’s [Scorsese’s] best film. I like the symmetry of it, the poetry of it.”Two of the defining themes of Scorsese’s career are his love of the moving image and his fascination with religion, so it’s fitting that Deakins singled out a scene that combines them as one of his favorite moments in the movie.“There’s another scene in the film that also guts me as well,” he said. “It’s the young Dalai Lama who’s got a 16mm projection and he’s watching a projection of the atom bomb and that’s devastating. The juxtaposition of the two cultures and the beauty but this horror of what’s actually on the screen. It’s interesting.”",

        "title": "‘May December’ Review: Natalie Portman, Julianne Moore Get Reflective in Haynes’ Deliciously Campy Drama",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Netflix releases the film in select theaters on Friday, November 17, with a streaming release to follow on Friday, December 1.A heartbreakingly sincere piece of high camp that teases real human drama from the stuff of tabloid sensationalism, Todd Haynes’ delicious “May December” continues the director’s tradition of making films that rely upon the self-awareness that seems to elude their characters — especially the ones played by Julianne Moore. Here, the actress reteams with her “Safe” director to play Gracie Atherton-Yoo, who became a household name back in 1992 when she left her ex-husband for her 13-year-old fellow pet shop employee. Now it’s 2015, the situation has normalized somewhat, and Gracie and Joe (a dad bod Charles Melton) have been together long enough that their youngest children are about to graduate high school. The occasional package full of poop still arrives at the waterside Savannah mansion that Gracie and Joe paid for with appearances on “Inside Edition,” but such deliveries — gifts from random strangers who can’t stomach the couple’s love story — have become less common now that their scandalous romance has settled into suburban reality. Or so it would appear.Alas, the past isn’t quite ready to release its grip on these crazy kids just yet, and Gracie lacks the good sense to keep it at a safe distance. Despite her skepticism of celebrities — the result of an unspecified run-in with Judge Judy — Gracie decides to roll out the welcome mat for breathy TV actress Elizabeth Berry, who’s played by Natalie Portman (phenomenally on pointe in a merciless performance that feels like it’s dressed in some kind of “Closer” drag). Elizabeth is the same age that Gracie was when she first had sex with Joe in the back of a pet store, and is set to play her in an upcoming independent film about the scandal. Whether it’s a part of her process or simply a byproduct of her insecurities about creating a character from scratch, Elizabeth is eager to study every inch of Gracie’s existence in order to prepare for the role. Even Daniel Day-Lewis would probably have some questions about the degree to which Elizabeth insinuates herself into Atherton-Yoo family life. One minute she’s asking Gracie how she met her husband, the next she’s visiting Joe in secret at the hospital where he works as an X-ray technician, and purring at her own ability to see right through him. By the time Elizabeth volunteers to sit for a Q&A at Gracie’s daughter’s high school acting class, where she replies to a snickering teenager’s question about sex scenes with a knowingly seductive monologue about the way that lines can blur between a performer and their part (“Am I pretending I’m experiencing pleasure, or am I pretending I’m not experiencing pleasure?”), it’s clear that Moore is about to be put through her most intense rehearsal process since “Vanya on 42nd Street.” Written by Samy Burch, whose script Haynes seems to have tweaked into a catty-as-fuck dark comedy that deepens his longstanding obsession with performance while poking fun at the kind of actresses he clearly loves so much, “May December” introduces itself as a piece of minimalism pitched somewhere between “All About Eve” and “Persona.” The average scene might unfold over the course of a sterile wide shot in Gracie’s kitchen that — hilariously — ends with her looking inside the fridge and declaring “I don’t have enough hot dogs!” as Michel Legrand’s dramatic theme from “The Go-Between” pounds over the soundtrack with the force of 1,000 soap operas. Or it could be set in the whisper-quiet restaurant bathroom where Gracie and Elizabeth stand side-by-side in front of the sink and stare directly into Christopher Blauvelt’s camera as they contemplate everything but their own reflections. For every skewering laughline, there’s a carefully posed shot of Natalie Portman obscured by a mannequin or flanked by two copies of her co-star in a trifold mirror.Haynes’ tonal playfulness has sometimes been overshadowed by the unerring consistency of his emotional textures, but here, in the funniest and least “stylized” of his films, it’s easier than ever to appreciate his genius for using artifice as a vehicle for truth. The interplay between the various modes that he flips between in “May December” may not be as dynamic as those in “Poison” or as striking as those in “Wonderstruck,” but Haynes has never swerved between them to such amusing effect, or made the conversation between them quite so legible in the process. Gracie might think her studied lack of shame indicates that she’s over the complications of starting a new family with a seventh-grader (peep Moore’s shark-eyed smile when she casually mentions the fact that her son and her grandson are both in the same grade at school), but her blithe “everyone’s got skeletons in their closet, have a piece of upside down pineapple cake!” attitude tells Elizabeth the opposite.Likewise, Gracie isn’t blind to the fact that Elizabeth couldn’t so much as put money in a parking meter without acting like she wanted to fuck it — she creates sexual tension with literally everyone she meets, up to and including the underage boy she walks past in slow-motion in a high school hallway — but the actress herself doesn’t seem to understand the insecurity that might convey to an observer, or have any awareness of the fact that Haynes is gradually shifting the brunt of his critical attention towards her. If Elizabeth’s mission to interrogate everyone in Gracie’s life makes the first half of “May December” feel like some kind of method actor “Spotlight,” the buried emotions she digs up along the way eventually force that spotlight back on her. Nobody in this movie is capable of looking at themselves, which is part of the reason why there’s such perverse fun to be had in passing our own judgments. Who is this strange woman who secretly pantomimes being ravished on the same pet store staircase where Gracie and Joe first had sex, and why is it so important to her that she understands her character’s every little nuance? Is her attraction to Joe genuine or parasitic, and will she give a shit if and when the process of studying Gracie’s life begins to change it forever? The various questions that “May December” raises as it destabilizes virtually everyone in it all lead back to one that Elizabeth is asked during that acting class: “How do you choose your roles?” Joe, who was forcibly coerced into his future with Gracie when he was only 13 years old, never had much of a say in the role he got to play. Melton delivers a well-modulated and eventually rather moving performance as a stunted man-child who’s younger than his own kids in some ways. Any Haynes film has a few lines that stop you dead in your tracks like an icepick to the heart, and none in “May December” are more striking than when Joe turns to his son in the middle of a conversation and blurts out: “I don’t know if we’re connecting, or if I’m creating a bad memory for you.” It’s a painfully honest confession from any parent to their kid, but it doubles here as an out-of-body experience for someone who — with a nudge from his wife’s understudy — is reconsidering his own casting for the first time in his adult life. Joe’s obsession with butterflies might seem to be a little on the nose, but what it means to emerge from a chrysalis has rarely been more fraught than it is here. “May December” is a film where one of the female leads protects her naïveté like a holy relic (Moore is predictably sensational, her soft-hard performance balancing Gracie on the knife’s edge between childlike fragility and matriarchal savageness), while the other possesses the power to be reborn with every set-up.It’s almost impossible for most of us to start over, as opposed to on a film set where a clean slate is never hard to find. Self-reflection isn’t necessary when you can always go again. And after you get the shot, there might even be time enough to grab a bonus take for safety. Or as Elizabeth might put it: “Just for me.”“May December” premiered in Competition at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.",

        "content": "Paul Schrader‘s new film “Master Gardener” wraps up his loose trilogy that began with “First Reformed” and “The Card Counter” via a fittingly controversial bang, as the film stars Joel Edgerton as a former white supremacist who hides from his past by working as a gardener on a large estate. Critics have pointed out that the unapologetic film is not for everyone — and Schrader has gleefully used his press tour to remind everyone that he doesn’t really care what they think.The film premiered at the 2022 Venice International Film Festival, where Schrader received a Golden Lion for his lifetime achievements in the film industry. But in a new interview with Vanity Fair, Schrader revealed that the film missed out on the opportunity to bow at a different festival due to concerns about the sensitive subject matter.“Cameron Bailey, who runs the Toronto Film Festival, had issues with it. They wouldn’t accept it,” Schrader said. “He said he couldn’t put a film in the festival that treats racism so lightly. The film deals with racism, but it doesn’t really deal with racism. It doesn’t really deal with white supremacism. Certainly, it doesn’t really deal with gardening. It deals with the journey of a soul. And then of course, you know, you put those hot-button issues in there, and you do a reverse Mandingo. You know, in the old plantation, the field hand or the kitchen girl were always prey for the white owner. Here we just reversed that, and the Proud Boy becomes Mandingo.”Schrader stood by his film, explaining that he sees it as an artistic interpretation of human existence rather than a commentary on the way the world currently operates.“Movies don’t always have to say, ‘this is the way it is,'” he said. “They can sometimes ask, ‘could there be another way?’ That is a way film can exercise the mind and the imagination. And the garden, of course, is the oldest fable we have. We were born there, and we would still be there if it wasn’t for that snake.”“Master Gardener” is now playing in theaters.",

        "title": "‘Killers of the Flower Moon’ Launches Oscar Campaign at Cannes",
        "content": "The hot ticket at Cannes — Martin Scorsese‘s three-and-a-half hour opus “Killers of the Flower Moon,” adapted by the director and Eric Roth from David Grann’s 2017 non-fiction bestseller — screened ahead of its Saturday festival premiere in New York and Los Angeles to give critics a head start on writing their reviews. It’s clear why Apple chose not to play the film in Competition: it’s earning a range of reactions.Sumptuously produced, the $200-million western crime saga transports the viewer to ’20s Oklahoma, where vast oil fields have brought immense wealth to the Osage Nation. While Grann’s book focuses on the procedural aspects of solving the so-called Reign of Terror that led to dozens of mysterious Osage deaths, Scorsese and Roth create a three-hander centered on the uncle and nephew played by Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio (Scorsese regulars united for the first time with their favorite director) and Native American actress Lily Gladstone (Kelly Reichardt’s “Certain Women”) as Ernest Burkhart’s wise and suspicious Osage wife, Mollie Kyle, who identifies her husband as a “coyote.”These three actors will dominate Oscar talk at year’s end. Oscar-winner De Niro (“Raging Bull,” “The Godfather Part II”) is formidable in a supporting role as the William “King” Hale, the charming and relentless master manipulator behind the murders who persuades his slow-witted World War I veteran nephew to not only marry the statuesque Kyle, but hire minions to carry out the murders of her two sisters, among others, in order to eventually score her family’s headrights.Two hours into the slow-paced epic, Texas Ranger hero turned FBI agent for J. Edgar Hoover, Thomas Bruce White (Jesse Plemons), arrives on the scene with a cadre of agents who swiftly piece the sordid murder plot together and proceed to trial. While Roth’s original script, like Grann’s book, played out like a police procedural as White (originally to be played by DiCaprio) solves the intricacies of the crime, Roth pivoted to give the Osage more gravitas in the narrative. Oscar-winner DiCaprio (“The Revenant”) found the role of Ernest Burkhart, a man who loves a woman while ordering the murder of her family, more complex and fascinating than the FBI man, who could play like a white saviour. If Plemons therefore does not carry enough screen time to warrant Oscar consideration, DiCaprio is scoring kudos for his layered performance as a blind follower who does what he is told, even if it means poisoning someone he cares for deeply.Gladstone steals the show. An actress who was on the verge of giving up her profession, she holds the screen against two powerful movie stars. In one compelling scene, as Burkhart is clumsily wooing her, a thunder storm descends on the house. He wants to keep talking. Kyle tells him to be quiet and listen to the storm.Revered auteur Scorsese, who could certainly have trimmed the length of his western gangster story, should nonetheless wind up in Oscar contention for the 15th time. He has been nominated 14 times, nine for Best Director, two writing nods shared with Jay Cocks, and three Best Picture nominations. He and his Oscar-winning co-screenwriter Eric Roth (“Forrest Gump”) could also land an Adapted Screenplay slot.Much like Jane Campion’s “The Power of the Dog” or Scorsese’s own “The Irishman,” which scored ten Oscar nominations, Oscar voters will surely wind up singing “Killer Moon”‘s extraordinary crafts: thrice-nominated cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (“The Irishman,” “The Silence,” “Brokeback Mountain”), three-time winning editor Thelma Schoonmaker (Scorsese’s “The Departed,” “The Aviator,” and “Raging Bull”), two-time nominee production designer Jack Fisk (“The Revenant,” “There Will Be Blood”), four-time nominee costume designer Jacqueline West (“Dune,” “The Revenant,” “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” “Quills”), and never-nominated composer Robbie Robertson (Scorsese’s documentary “The Last Waltz”), whose mother was Cayuga and Mohawk.While the Apple Studios production will see October theatrical release by Paramount Pictures before it goes online, many Academy voters will wind up watching it on the screening portal, which is far from an ideal viewing experience for this immersive epic.",

        "title": "‘Killers of the Flower Moon’ Review: DiCaprio Gives His Best Performance for Scorsese’s Bitterest Crime Epic",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Apple Studios and Paramount Pictures will release the film in theaters on Friday, October 20, with an AppleTV+ streaming release to follow.Martin Scorsese may like to think of “Killers of the Flower Moon” as the Western that he always wanted to make, but this frequently spectacular American epic about the genocidal conspiracy that was visited upon the Osage Nation during the 1920s is more potent and self-possessed when it sticks a finger in one of the other genres that bubble up to the surface over the course of its three-and-a-half-hour runtime.The first and most obvious of those is a gangster drama in the grand tradition of the director’s previous work. Just when it seemed like “The Irishman” might’ve been Scorsese’s final word on his signature genre, they’ve pulled him back in for another movie full of brutal killings, bitter voiceovers, and biting conclusions about the corruptive spirit of American capitalism. “Gimme Shelter” may not have made it into the final cut, but the chugging bass groove of Robbie Robertson’s brilliantly anachronistic score almost leads you to believe that it might.And yet, the “Reign of Terror” — which came in the wake of an oil discovery that made the members of the Osage Nation in Oklahoma the richest people per capita on planet Earth — proves to be an uncomfortably vast backdrop for Scorsese’s  more intimate brand of crime saga. The book from which “Killers of the Flower Moon” has been adapted is a sweeping tale about the end of the Wild West and the birth of the 20th century, as the author David Grann devotes roughly equal time to the modern sociopath who orchestrated the Osage slayings and the old-fashioned cowboy who J. Edgar Hoover dispatched to stop him. Scorsese’s more narrowly focused version takes stock of those tectonic shifts in our nation’s history, but only in passing. Its primary interest is limited to the sinister mastermind and his favorite lapdog, two beady-eyed fucks whose understanding of the new American landscape was limited to the belief that it still belonged to them. William Hale saw the Osage as mere stewards for the wealth his country had accidentally gifted to its indigenous population in the act of stealing their land. He maintained a holy conviction that America was still a place where certain people could get away with murder committed in the name of white progress, and the most distressing passages of Scorsese’s film make clear why Hale may have continued to believe that even after the Bureau of Investigation began to pursue him. But if Grann’s book was an expansive conspiracy thriller that teased out the facts of the case while always keeping at least one eye fixed on America’s transition from myth to modernity, Eric Roth’s script casually identifies the murderers as soon as it can in order to drill that much deeper into the relationship between them. This “Killers of the Flower Moon” doesn’t ebb and flow so much as it seeps out from the ground and pools in a small handful of different places.Needless to say, Roth’s approach doesn’t pan out so well for the aforementioned cowboy, as the straight-shooting Tom White is diminished to the point that he would hardly even register in this story if not for the quiet moral strength that Jesse Plemons brings to the role. He’s just a stiff man in a striped suit, as opposed to a living emblem of the faded American West. Ironically, Roth and Scorsese originally envisioned White as the protagonist of this story, only to start over from scratch once they realized that centering law enforcement would pull too much focus away from the Osage themselves, and from the awful toll these events took upon their entire community. Even in the finished version — despite a host of indelible performances from Native American actors like William Belleau and Tantoo Cardinal — the haunting witness they offer to the horror around them is less immediate than the silence that surrounds it. What Roth’s adaptation does allow is for “Killers of the Flower Moon” to blossom into a compellingly multi-faceted character study about the men behind the massacre. Even more importantly, it invites the most recent of Scorsese’s late-career triumphs to become the most interesting of the many different movies that comprise it: A twisted love story about the marriage between an Osage woman and the white man who — unbeknownst to her — helped murder her entire family so that he could inherit the headrights for their oil fortune.That sepia-toned saga of slow-poisoned self-denial is sustained by the best performance of Leonardo DiCaprio’s entire career. The former matinee idol has never been shy about playing low-lifes and scum-bums, but his nuanced and uncompromising turn as the cretinous Ernest Burkhart mines new wonders from the actor’s long-standing lack of vanity. “Killers of the Flower Moon” begins with Ernest returning to his hometown of Fairfax, Oklahoma after the end of World War I (where he suffered a “blown up gut” that seems to have limited his ability to do physical labor), and from the moment he arrives at the local train station he finds that the hierarchy of power has changed in his absence. The Osage population is now awash in the lavish wealth they’ve come to enjoy since the American government accidentally relocated them atop a veritable gold mine, while opportunistic whites from near and far are scrambling to get their hands on that money any way they can. For some men, that means taking photographs or selling cars along the booming main street that Scorsese uses as his film’s most vibrant and transportive backdrop (with some help from legendary production designer Jack Fisk). For other, more conniving types, that means marrying into Osage money, which — due to a flagrantly racist “guardianship” system that declared Native Americans too “incompetent” to handle their own finances — would also grant these gold-digging trophy husbands full control over their wives’ cash. For his part, the not-so-bright Ernest seems mostly bemused by the whole situation. A New York seven but a Fairfax 12, he saunters around town with the slack-jawed swagger of someone who’s got a limitless supply of moonshine at the start of Prohibition, with DiCaprio delivering every one of Ernest’s twangy half-thoughts directly from the bottom of his sunken jowls; imagine an entire performance born from the Lemmons scene in “The Wolf of Wall Street,” and a character designed to pacify all those people who argued that Jordan Belfort was just too darn likable. Ernest’s good looks, bad brains, and general disinterest in the consequences of his own actions wouldn’t seem to be a recipe for success, but his upwardly mobile uncle — William Hale, the self-proclaimed “King of the Osage Hills” — knows a useful idiot when he sees one. Played by a sickly sweet and unyieldingly sinister Robert De Niro, Hale is a local businessman who claims, with no small amount of condescension, to love the Osage like his own children. In fact, he would love for them to be his own children, with their headrights gushing up to his wallet like oil from the ground beneath their feet. As Hale puts it to his nephew: “If you’re gonna make trouble, make it big.” By that point, Hale has already identified Ernest as the perfect derrick for one of the biggest untapped veins in town: An unmarried Osage woman named Mollie Kyle. Soon to be rechristened Mrs. Burkhart (“Certain Women” breakout Lily Gladstone, an undeniably major talent), Mollie may be “incompetent” under the eyes of the white man’s law, but she can’t even say that word without betraying the bitterly ferocious intellect of someone who knows the score, recognizes that she’s being played, and has reluctantly accepted the fact that her people have few alternative options. Gladstone conveys that much and more within just a few seconds of appearing on screen, which proves essential to a very long film that never affords her character the time she deserves. Mollie’s first-act flirtation with Ernest finds “The Killers of the Flower Moon” at its most agile and alive, with Scorsese firing on all cylinders as his movie explodes out of the gate. As Mollie’s closest relatives start dropping like flies, however, and Mrs. Ernest Burkhart herself slips into a diabetic stupor that will keep her off her feet for the length of an entire “Kundun,” the story around her downshifts into a scattered array of errant details that don’t equal the sum of their parts (at least upon the first viewing of a film that’s impossible to fully digest in one go). By the time Mollie re-emerges into the spotlight a few hours later, still the movie’s richest character, it’s too late to plumb the full complexity of her feelings about the terror on either a personal or collective level.That proves all the more frustrating because she and Ernest make such a spellbinding pair together, particularly as their genuine affection for each other begins to outlive many of Mollie’s other family members. Ernest becomes so accustomed to the leash Hale keeps around his neck that he almost surrenders the last of his free will, but DiCaprio’s performance — against all odds — stirs a strange kind of sympathy from the spectacle of an oafish, vile man who no longer understands the truth of his own feelings, let alone the role he may have played in poisoning the only person who cares about him. It’s thrillingly ambiguous and uncomfortable stuff, and Gladstone matches DiCaprio beat-for-beat as a woman who experiences the same queasiness because she does understand the truth of her own feelings. That this film survives the semi-tedious courtroom drama it becomes toward the end is a testament to Scorsese’s enduring genius for bad romance; no storyteller on Earth is better at blurring the fine line between love and exploitation, whether between two people, or two peoples. It might be a bit reductive to think of Ernest and Mollie’s relationship as a metaphor for that between white America and the Osage Nation, but the anguish and confusion that Scorsese wrings from it is so powerful that it practically demands to be considered in such a broad historical context. At the very least, it resonates within a context of Scorsese’s own: as De Niro’s puckered Hale plots the destruction of the same Osage Nation families who saw him as a benevolent intermediary to white America, you might hear echoes (or pre-cursors) of the same disassociation that coursed through the likes of “Casino” and “The Wolf of Wall Street.” I was reminded of the last thought that went through Ace Rothstein’s head before a car exploded under his feet: “When you love someone, you’ve gotta trust them. There’s no other way. You’ve got to give them the key to everything that’s yours. Otherwise, what’s the point? And for a while, I believed that’s the kind of love I had.”But it’s not the kind of love he gave, or the kind that Hale gives here to a people who are in dire need of a white man with their best interests at heart. What they fail to realize is that Hale is convinced the Osage Nation’s time is over, and that he’s just an agent of fate who’s helping to unburden them of their wealth before they settle into the past. With the help of Ernest’s brother (Scott Shepherd) and the rest of his lackeys (a deep bench of great faces, including Sturgill Simpson and the morbidly hilarious Louis Cancelmi), Hale kills the Osage with the indifference of a tiger mauling its prey. Even in spite of Hale’s anti-historical reasoning, however, the film’s pinhole focus makes it hard to appreciate him as anything more than a homicidal capitalist. That’s what he was, of course, but without broader context this smiling monster comes off as more of an anomaly than a symptom of a deeper American sickness (Roth and Scorsese’s wise decision to invoke the Tulsa Race Massacre is the exception that proves the rule). Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto’s many-splendored palette of dry and dusty browns creates a palpable sense of time and place, but the frame of his camera is seldom allowed to expand much wider than Fisk’s Main Street set, as a story that begins with an eye toward the limitless potential of America’s future gradually constricts into a series of medium shots that frame out the same people from whom that future was denied. It’s a difficult balancing act for a filmmaker as gifted and operatic as Scorsese, whose ability to tell any story rubs up against his ultimate admission that this might not be his story to tell. And so, for better or worse, Scorsese turns “Killers of the Flower Moon” into the kind of story that he can still tell better than anyone else: A story about greed, corruption, and the mottled soul of a country that was born from the belief that it belonged to anyone callous enough to take it. “Killers of the Flower Moon” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Apple Studios and Paramount Pictures will release it in theaters on Friday, October 20.",

        "content": "When “Oppenheimer” hits theaters this summer, it will mark the second time that Christopher Nolan has directed a film based on a true story. While he found success with the World War II thriller “Dunkirk,” he generally focuses on wildly imaginative original genre projects. So what drew him to tell the story of the man who invented the atomic bomb?In a new interview with Total Film, Nolan explained that his interest in Oppenheimer stemmed from his career-spanning fascination with “protagonists who have ambiguity to them.” He said that the inventor’s morally ambiguous approach to his work placed him firmly in line with other famous Nolan characters — including the Dark Knight himself.“I think of any character I’ve dealt with, Oppenheimer is by far the most ambiguous and paradoxical. Which, given that I’ve made three Batman films, is saying a lot.”Nolan heaped praise on Cillian Murphy‘s ability to embody the complex character, saying that his frequent collaborator might have been the only actor who could handle the job.“In truth, there are just not that many actors that you could say, on a first-person approach, ‘Yeah, we’re going to be this guy for three hours,'” he said. “You’re making a demand of an actor that very few actors in the history of film can rise to. I will say that even with that confidence in him, he was continually surprising me on set every day. And when we got into the edit suite and were putting the performance together, and seeing the truth of it, I was absolutely blown away.” Murphy echoed Nolan’s sentiments, adding that his fascination with the character only grew once he got past the surface-level historical facts and began to dig into Oppenheimer’s psyche.“I think I had kind of Wikipedia-level of knowledge of Oppenheimer, like most people,” Murphy said. “So then it was… Well, it was just starting from scratch, really. Chris guided me through that. You can only do it one bite at a time. You have to go slowly. And thankfully we had time.”“Oppenheimer” opens in theaters on Friday, July 21.

        "title": "‘Robot Dreams’ Review: Neon’s Bittersweet Animated Buddy Comedy Glistens",
        "content": "The miracle of friendship rather than the image of electric sheep is what occupies the subconscious of the charming android gleefully strolling through “Robot Dreams,” Spanish director Pablo Berger’s first animated venture. Fashioned into moving form from the graphic novel by Sara Varon, this hand-drawn buddy dramedy preserves both the cartoon strip aesthetic and lack of dialogue of the source material for a delightfully bittersweet animated wonder that embodies the medium’s most purely cinematic qualities. Now the fierce battle for the title of the best animated film of the year has a new strong contender.More akin to the sophisticated world of “BoJack Horseman” than that of Disney’s “Zootopia,” the setting is 1980s New York City — the twin towers of the World Trade Center still frame the skyline — but densely populated with an array of anthropomorphic animals. The bustling energy of the Big Apple shines through in how its residents go about their business in the background of the main plot. The metropolis holds a million stories, some of which we occasionally get a glimpse into via the film’s abundant and amusing sight gags.Crowded and incessantly in flux as it is, the urban center represents a prime territory for its inhabitants to experience emotional isolation even if one would struggle to find total physical solitude. Plagued with such loneliness one night in his East Village apartment, Dog, a pudgy bipedal canine, buys a robotic companion from a late-night infomercial with the same ease as he would a kitchen appliance. After some required assembly, Robot, a lanky and yet impressively flexible automaton with a beaming grin and kind eyes, comes alive to fend off the gloom in Dog’s existence. The dog days are indeed over, or so he thinks.With contagious joie de vivre, the two instant bros take on Manhattan, rollerblading in Central Park to the tune of Earth, Wind & Fire’s groovy “September,” whose lyrics about reminiscing on the glory of bygone days will later gain resonance, or simply basking in the quiet pleasures of having someone to share the mundane marvels of everyday life. No one has enjoyed these streets more than this pair. Together, every instant brims with freshness.“Robot Dreams” calls to mind the grounded fantastical warmth of films such as “Robot and Frank” or last year’s “Brian and Charles,” which don’t get caught up in the mechanics, ethical implications, or perils of artificial intelligence in the sobering manner that say Spielberg’s “A.I.,” “Ex-Machina” or the recent horror hit “M3GAN” do; and instead focus on the heartfelt nature of their central relationships. Tonally, its closest relative in this ever-growing family of on-screen fraternal ties between flesh-and-bone individuals and sentient metal humanoids is Brad Bird’s animated masterpiece “The Iron Giant.” Berger’s much lower-stakes balm of a movie, however, stands out for its own non-verbal ingenuity.The muscular simplicity of the sharp line work and the playful character design in “Robot Dreams” mimics the ligne claire graphic style first popularized in the first half of the 20th century by Belgian cartoonist Hergé, best known for creating “The Adventures of Tintin.” Faithful to Varon’s work, Berger’s animated effort preserves the vivid solid colors without much shading and the visual business of the intricate production design, which captures the sensory overload of the city and earns it a spot among the great New York movies.Within this loving tribute to the frantic charm of NYC, the director inserts inconspicuous nods to his homeland: Dog carries a bag emblazoned with a humanlike orange named Naranjito, the mascot for the 1982 World Cup held in Spain, and later receives a devastating postcard from Barcelona. Considering Berger’s exquisite “Blancanieves,” a black-and-white adaptation of “Snow White” into a Spanish context during the country’s civil war, which boasted bull fighters and flamenco dancing, it’s no surprise then that his whimsical sensibilities would eventually hurtle him into the boundless arms of animation.But perhaps what made the Spanish storyteller an ideal interpreter for Varon’s tender American bromance is that his “Blancanieves” also featured no spoken dialogue. He relied mostly on the facial expressions of his protagonists and the information rendered visible within the frames. In “Robot Dreams,” Berger’s knack for irreverent humor is laced with the influence of the silent era masters of physical comedy, namely Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, with the notable difference that a rich soundscape enlivens the environment.At the height of Dog and Robot’s flourishing camaraderie, a fortuitous beach day of underwater adventures and unforgettable fun throws a wrench into their plans for a future side by side. Stranded on the sand without movement, innocent Robot dreams up positive hypothetical scenarios hopeful that Dog will find a solution to their forced separation.Whatever version of events he imagines always leads to a long-awaited and magical reunion with Dog. Meanwhile, the other half of this partnership fights bureaucracy to regain access to the shore. Dog’s growing impotence and the inevitable passage of time slowly erode what once seemed unbreakable, not out of disinterest but mere distance between them.Robot’s eponymous dreams communicate his utterly sincere longing for platonic companionship, the only love he’s ever known, at times as darkly droll vignettes. One particularly radiant sequence that unfolds in his wired subconscious borrows elements from the “The Wizard of Oz” and its promise of a wish granted and repurposes them into a psychedelic fever vision. Each passage elucidates fears and yearnings with potent clarity. That Berger and his animation team programmed into his character and the narrative as a whole such astoundingly profound ruminations, delivered as part of this brightly colored metropolitan fable, denotes the affecting effectiveness of their pitch-perfect artistry.  Both Robot and Dog ultimately move on from the intensity of their bond, not exactly by choice but out of spiritual necessity. Robot quite literally sings a different tune and changes his appearance after making a new caring friend. But the fault for the schism doesn’t fall on either of them. That lack of a villain in many of the painful transitions we experience in our time alive is what “Robot Dreams” gets at beautifully. When the voices of Earth, Wind & Fire once again asks them, “Do you remember?” the answer is most certainly affirmative, but one of them chooses a sacrificial act of love: to spare everyone the hurt and awkwardness of an untimely reconnection. Their timelines have been unaligned, and maybe that’s how they are meant to stay. With its soulful tin heart, “Robot Dreams” moves us to appreciate the fortune of having a precious pal. Whether for a season or a lifetime.“Robot Dreams” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. It has been acquired by Neon for North American distribution.",

        "title": "‘The New Boy’ Review: Warwick Thornton and Cate Blanchett Find Magic in This Spiritual Fairy Tale",
        "content": "The spark of life that gave Warwick Thornton what is now “The New Boy” took 18 years to flicker, and then fully glow. The Australian filmmaker looked to his own childhood, raised by monks, to find the spiritual fairy tale that now manifests via the film’s eponymous Aboriginal child in a sweeping and poetic portrait of stifled faith and the threat of monopoly on religion. Thornton’s cinema is one of enormous, orchestral music and vast landscapes that envelop and invite us in, even if you feel like you don’t know where you’re going or shouldn’t be allowed to look around. It’s the kind of culturally specific filmmaking that somehow immediately gains universality in that ambition to connect, to understand the empathy and sensitivity to listen in to these conflicts and this bright spark of a boy who speaks to struggles of faith however you were raised. He is simply known as the New Boy, a nameless Aboriginal boy (a breakout turn from Aswan Reid, almost completely silent but beguiling) welcomed in by Sister Eileen (Cate Blanchett) at her fiercely protective remote monastery. It’s 1940s Australia in the middle of World War II, and the New Boy is captured by a horseback police patrol and dumped with Sister Eileen. But she does and will care for him — her faith is religious but also transcendent when it comes to her small group of boys. She works with the Church, but ultimately for those she cares for. That includes two Aboriginal staff, George (Wayne Blair) and Sister Mum (prolific Australian TV actress and emotive standout Deborah Mailman) who, with Sister Eileen, nurture the next generation while reconciling multiple schools of thought in the name of survival. But Thornton often lenses the film with great beauty (acting as DoP as well as writer and director, alongside Jules Wurm as camera operator), as much in wide-open vistas of the wild bush in the wind as the fragility of a fly landing on Sister Eileen’s eyelid as she awakens from a nap. The world is harsh, challenging, but there is poetry in the hope that things can still grow and become beautiful. It doesn’t hurt to have Nick Cave and Warren Ellis on scoring duties, arguably the best possible pairing to work with this out-of-reality remote way of living, engaging with the natural world, its parched fields and beating sun, while still injecting immense life and humanity — and so, hope — into everything that breathes. And that goes for a lot more things than you’d initially expect. Everything changes for the New Boy — and for Sister Eileen — when a life-size carving of Christ on the cross arrives. Everybody knows what it means, but the New Boy doesn’t. He sees things the others don’t, and Reid’s angelic innocence is hypnotic to follow. He eventually manages two words after spending some time feeling his way through these things everybody seems to believe in: “Slut” and “Amen.” But the words don’t matter — his spark does. Thornton injects a childlike sense of wonder with literal glimmers of light, magic realism making its way into this stark, severe environment. Because when you’re a kid, out in a bold new world, it’s all you have. The New Boy sees things in Christ that only he can. There’s movement — in his chest, his sighing eyebrows, in droplets of blood making a splash on the floor that nobody else can feel. It’s like nothing Sister Eileen has ever experienced, which pushes Blanchett’s own performance to extremes that the likes of Lydia Tár would shudder at. There’s deep emotion and vulnerability in Blanchett’s work, with its performance counteracting the New Boy’s calm and comfortable otherness with an almost overbearing dedication to care. What Thornton is striving toward, an embrace of generosity, of humanity being able to change what faith and religion even mean, is often moving. But in ways that many cynics of the world we live in have long lost — that spark only touches those still letting it in. Reid plays the New Boy’s difference, almost beyond human, with surprising subtlety and restraint for such a raw performer (which is essential to capture that primal sense of survival at all costs). There’s conflict in everything, in the clashing of worlds and the fight for a world that makes sense to believe in, yet miraculous poetry and optimism somehow, too. But then whatever seems like it’s taking us down a path shifts — and the spark is out. And even then, all is not lost (how could it ever be, with “Sing Sing Sing” by Benny Goodman just entering the show). The New Boy may have entered the community somewhat, changed paths just a little, but Sister Eileen’s community is entirely different than what it once was. Christianity must make room for Aboriginal spirituality, and all other schools of thought in the world we live in, full of new boys. That Thornton has found a language to tell this loud, and find magic in it, could be a tiny miracle in itself. “The New Boy” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "title": "‘About Dry Grasses’ Review: Nuri Bilge Ceylan Returns with Another Masterclass in Conversational Cinema",
        "content": "At nearly 200 minutes in length, “About Dry Grasses” (or “Kuru Otlar Üstüne”) is par for the course for Turkish virtuoso Nuri Bilge Ceylan. He returns, once again, to the icy frost of his Anatolia-set Palme d’Or winner “Winter Sleep,” for a story that beats with similar frustrations towards power in the grand social scheme. However, he weaves this theme into his background tapestry, favoring instead a talkative and often discomforting tale of a small-town art teacher, his 12-year-old female student, and an accusation of impropriety that might be false on its surface, but is rooted in truths the camera sees. Where “Winter Sleep” adapted Russian greats like Chekhov and Dostoyevsky — it draws from both “The Wife” and “The Brothers Karamazov”— “About Dry Grasses” plays like a spiritual descendant of Nabokov’s “Lolita,” at least in its use of point-of-view. Ceylan’s novelistic approach to cinema could perhaps find no more fitting a partner than Nabokov’s lyricism, the kind that is at once cinematic in spirit, and yet wholly difficult to adapt for the screen.Ceylan’s latest takes a similarly imaginative, poetic approach to everything from the dull and mundane to the downright sordid, filtering a distasteful story of a man beset by rural frustrations through a surprisingly personal lens, one that keeps things frequently intriguing, occasionally electric, and altogether challenging. It’s only toward the very end of the movie’s 3 hours and 17 minutes that one feels the weight of its running time, by which point anything approaching emotional oppressiveness becomes added emphasis — an exclamation point at the end of its protagonist’s narcissistic screed.The first image we see emerging from the empty, frigid white backdrop is Samet (Deniz Celiloğlu), a middle-aged art instructor and part-time photographer making his way across what feels like a rural wasteland, to begin his fourth year of compulsory residence teaching rural eighth graders in the dead of winter. He comes off, at first, like a pleasant, personable, and new-ish (though not quite “new”) addition to the roster of teachers who have been around much longer than he has, including his housemate Kenan (Musab Ekici). Like several of the other faculty, they live in one of the tiny buildings scattered around the school, while the students pour in from nearby townships in Eastern Anatolia. One student, the lively, boisterous Sevim (Ece Bağcı), is Samet’s clear favorite, between the gifts he secretly gives her, and the fact that he only calls on her and her closest friends to answer questions in class. If other students dare to point this out, he responds unkindly.As Sevim, Bağcı is shouldered with the immense challenge of both playing Samet’s bubbly and eerily two-dimensional conception of her, as well as a more nuanced and realistic performance the camera captures in fleeting hints, in the rare moments that depict the psychological impact of their dynamic, away from Samet’s presence. It’s a mesmerizing performance from such a young actress, made all the more stunning by her interplay with Celiloğlu, who whips from charming to fiery and fearsome at a moment’s notice. However, just as cinematically intriguing is the way Celiloğlu reins in this part of Samet after letting it fly off the handle, reeling it in and making it a newfound part of the character’s personality, as if each ferocious outburst had added a hint of color to his complexion.Ceylan’s interest lies not in crafting the kind of film where a teacher outright crosses several lines, but the kind that floats cautiously along those lines as Samet seems to blur them. As much as “About Dry Grasses” remains plot-driven in its first half — the length of an average feature film to begin with — it’s also a detailed portrait of the kind of person able to skillfully manipulate those around him, while maintaining a safe level of deniability. In that aforementioned first half, a roundabout accusation is delivered to Samet through third and fourth parties. He isn’t familiar with what he’s being accused of, but he fearfully suspects his pet student may be somehow involved, and he adjusts his behavior towards her accordingly, punishing her and playing the victim, thus providing a window into the kind of woe-is-me self-pity that a character of his fragile temperament might immediately turn to.However, Ceylan isn’t satisfied with containing Samet and his existence to this specific scenario. After all, the lives of predators and victims (and people in general) don’t stop once an accusation arises. From that point on, just as much of the film is about his and Kenan’s friendship with an English teacher at a nearby school, Nuray (Merve Dizdar), and the way Samet perceives their triangular dynamic. Whether or not Samet is a groomer, the tendencies he displays must surely manifest elsewhere, in different and more socially acceptable ways — what might that look like?Ceylan is a master of the lengthy, languid take, wherein the camera’s steady and suppressed energy — in wide or medium shots — allows for a skillful and often precise build to moments of passionate exchange. The length of his shots, going on for several minutes at a time, affords each character the chance to create a world unto themselves, an opportunity of which Samet undoubtedly avails.However, the worlds that clearly exist in the lives of Nuray, Sevim, Kenan, and so forth are worlds to which the camera does not have access. It sees hints of other people, but remains trapped by Samet’s purview, one that takes even Ceylan’s fully-realized aesthetic oscillations — few filmmakers are better at imbuing the frame with enormity and intensity by suddenly moving their camera, or cutting quickly from oblique wide shots to stunningly composed, head-on close ups — and turns them into stylistic capitulations, as if the film’s very fabric were warping around Samet’s ability to move through the world as he deems fit.Of course, Samet is but an extension of Ceylan (and of his wife and co-writer Ebru Ceylan, and their fellow writing partner Akın Aksu). Ceylan’s previous works have long featured small-town figures and artists moving to big cities — a reflection of his own story — but Samet is a former resident of Istanbul, and the frustrations that inform his uncaring actions are born at least in part from having had to move away from what he calls “civilization,” and to a place and people he loathes. Even the intimacy he’s able to forge with other people ends up wielded like a weapon, and so “About Dry Grasses” can’t help but feel like Ceylan asking what might become of him if he, and not some hypothetical person, were thrust into these circumstances. Like Ceylan, Samet’s keen eye for still photography is central to his outlook, and the movie takes frequent detours into photo-essay territory, depicting the way he captures the world around him. The narrative is so tethered to his perspective, despite its occasional hints of a wider physical and emotional world, that at one point, it all but loops back on itself in order to expose its own artifice — a tongue-in-cheek depiction of the way Samet cloaks and conceals himself around other people, even in moments that seem genuine and generous. The film positions even the creation of images as an act of narcissism — introspection in the form of scathing self-critique — but an act through which fears and frustrations can be easily found, and easily felt.To call a work such as this “self-indulgent” would be nothing if not a compliment, for it embodies the human tendencies of self-indulgence in a way few others have in recent memory — not the indulgence of wealth or luxurious opulence, but the indulgences that exist despite their absence, in towns like the one in which Samet reluctantly finds himself. It’s about the indulgences of power in minor and corrosive ways, enacted even by characters whose depth and richness spreads across the screen in vivid hues.Ceylan’s is the cinema of what’s seen, as well as the cinema of what one of the film’s own characters rightly calls “beyond the visible,” when discussing his thoughts on memory and religion. Your mileage may vary, but “About Dry Grasses” is among the most brilliantly off-putting works to be featured at Cannes in recent years, with so rotten a core that every hint of virtue or even normalcy in the camera’s peripheral vision becomes a tragedy unto itself, simply by way of being ignored.“About Dry Grasses” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.

        "title": "How Jason Momoa’s Outrageous ‘Fast X’ Character Became Equal Parts Python and Peacock",
        "content": "Fans of the “Fast and the Furious” movies learned long ago that they could rely on the franchise to keep raising the stakes and increasing the scale with each new entry, and “Fast X” is no exception. Yet even in a movie filled with awe-inspiring set pieces involving nuclear bombs dragged through the streets of Rome and cars driving down the surface of massive dams, perhaps the most exciting development is the addition of Dante, the flamboyant villain played by Jason Momoa. As demonstrative and hilarious as his adversary Dom (Vin Diesel) is restrained and taciturn, Dante exponentially increases the already high energy of every scene he’s in and brings a welcome sense of style to the proceedings.A huge part of Dante’s appeal is his look, which Momoa crafted carefully with his longtime hair and makeup artist Jennifer Stanfield. “Jason has very clear ideas of what he likes,” Stanfield told IndieWire. “He wanted Dante to be very showy, so he referenced peacocks quite a bit. His hair had to be as big as we could possibly make it.” A starting point for Momoa was the costumes created by “Fast and the Furious” veteran Sanja Milkovic Hays, who dressed the actor in a python jacket that gave the impression of Dante slipping in and out of an animal’s skin — something that underlined Momoa’s concept of the character as a man with a seductive outer layer concealing danger.To accentuate this duality, Momoa wore contact lenses to create a specific effect as the audience got a closer look at his “Fast X” character. “He wanted to have a sort of sharklike look,” Stanfield said. “The contact lenses cut all of the warmth from his natural eye color, just to give that extra sense of evil as you get close to him. Jason wanted the bright colors of the costumes and makeup to draw people in, but then when you get close you see that he’s got these dark, soulless eyes.” To that end, Hays dressed Momoa largely in whites and pastels, which Stanfield in turn had to match in keeping with Dante’s fashion-forward sensibility. “We matched his fingernail polish to his costumes,” Stanfield said. “And it wasn’t just one color, sometimes each nail had a different color or even two colors on the same nail. I don’t know how many bottles of nail polish I went through!”The attention to detail in the color palette went beyond the connection between costumes and hair and makeup — at one point Momoa’s fingernail polish matches the color of his motorcycle, and even the color of Dante’s car was dictated by the character’s fondness for pastels. “I don’t think the car was planned to be lavender at first,” Stanfield said. “It all stemmed from his lavender outfit. He loved that so much that he said, ‘I have to have a lavender car.'”It takes a lot to stand out in a film filled with souped-up vehicles, wall-to-wall action sequences and as many massive movie stars as a typical red carpet, but a peacocking Jason Momoa behind the wheel of a lavender car is tough to beat as one of the most memorable images in “Fast X.”",

        "content": "It’s a sad day for “Bounty Law” fans. Rick Dalton, the actor who rose to prominence for playing Jake Cahill on the popular Western series, died at the age of 90 today. If you believe Quentin Tarantino, that is.The official Twitter account for Tarantino and Roger Avary’s Video Archives Podcast announced the news that the fictional actor, who was played by Leonardo DiCaprio in “Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood” is no longer alive in the universe of Tarantino films.We are saddened by the news of the passing of actor Rick Dalton, best known for his roles in the hit TV series Bounty Law and The Fireman trilogy.\n\nRick passed away peacefully in his home in Hawaii and is survived by his wife Francesca.\n\nRIP Rick Dalton 1933-2023 pic.twitter.com/j51sNEh7AP“Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood” covered a transitional period in Dalton’s career, when he was no longer a viable movie star in America and had been reduced to doing regular TV guest spots as a “heavy” that the heroic main characters could defeat. He spent most of his time with his best friend and longtime stuntman Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), who loyally stuck by his side even after the stunt opportunities dried up. He eventually hit rock bottom and was forced to move to Rome for six months to make Spaghetti Westerns and spy movies — which, as Cliff pointed out, was not the “fate worse than death” that he seemed to think it was. With the help of his agent Marvin Schwarz, he was able to work with the likes of Sergio Corbucci and establish himself as a major Italian movie star in films such as “Kill Me Quick, Ringo, Said the Gringo” and “Operazione Dyn-O-Mite!” He met his wife Francesca on the trip, and the two of them eventually moved back to Los Angeles together.Upon returning, he memorably got into a fight with members of the Manson family when they inadvertently broke into his house while pursuing his neighbors, Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate. He eventually saved the day by busting out a flamethrower that he used as a prop on an old movie and torching several of them to death.Tarantino has always gone out of his way to share details of Dalton’s intricate backstory, so it’s not particularly surprising that he knew exactly when the character would die. He expanded on Dalton’s story in his novelization of the film, revealing that the Manson incident revived Dalton’s celebrity status. The character became a regular on “The Tonight Show” and began booking bigger acting jobs on shows like “Mission: Impossible” before retiring to Hawaii in 1988. Tarantino even closed his own meta storytelling loop by revealing that he himself met Dalton at the 1996 Hawaii International Film Festival.Dalton is survived by his wife, Francesca. There is no word on the status of Cliff Booth.",

        "title": "Ethan Hawke Has Never Been Offered an Animated Movie: ‘I Could Do That Guy’s Voice’",
        "content": "Ethan Hawke has been in Hollywood for close to 40 years but never has the Oscar nominee landed his dream role…in an animated film.The “Strange Way of Life” actor revealed during an Interview magazine discussion with his former “Good Lord Bird” co-star Daveed Diggs that he is envious of stars who lend their voice to animated features. Diggs voices Sebastian the crab in the live-action “Little Mermaid” film, now in theaters.“My whole life as an actor I’ve dreamed of getting some email saying, ‘You can audition for the voice in one of these,'” Hawke told Diggs. “I’ve never done [an animated movie]. Nobody’s ever come.”Hawke added, “I watch all these movies and I’m like, ‘Oh, I could do that guy’s voice.'”The “First Reformed” star voiced a character in one episode of “Robot Chicken” in 2007. Hawke also narrated novels and performed in Audible podcast series “Fishpriest” in which he played an undercover narcotics officer turned bounty hunter in 1990s Bronx.“As a performer, the power of the voice is an art form unto itself. And I love sound design,” Hawke told Audible in May 2022. “When you first go to acting school, one of the first classes they take you to is voice and speech, and about what can be accomplished. The really great theater directors I’ve worked with cast people based on their voices. It’s a strange thing when you don’t like the way something sounds, and that’s not on purpose.”Hawke continued, “The idea of trying to re-explore what an audio play could be was dynamic and interesting to me. I think it’s a great way for us to use our imaginations. One of the problems with movies sometimes is they do so much of the work for you, and they rob you of the experience of really engaging your own imagination. [Radio plays] ask more of you than a movie. But because of that, it has a possibility of giving you more too, because you are asked to engage, you have to participate. You have to hear that joint inhale, and then your brain has to go, ‘Oh yeah, I can picture that,’ and your brain pictures it, and you might make it better than some top-notch cinematographer would have. You’ll bring your own memories, your own feelings.”The “Training Day” actor added, “Some of the worst temper tantrums I’ve ever had in my life are when they screw up the sound on films that I’ve done, when they change your voice or they cut two takes together, or they think that this rasp in your voice is a mistake and they cut it out, or they do bad sound design so that the performance can’t be heard or felt. I don’t understand it exactly, but I know when they screw it up and it makes me so upset. People love to talk about how great Meryl Streep’s accent work is, but the reason why it’s so great is she manages to have an accent and use her own voice. Some people do accents and they just do imitations. And it might be a good imitation, but I can’t feel them anymore. So to that point, I’m a student of what the voice does.”",

        "title": "After Cannes, Hit International Titles Must Contend with Local Politics and Academy Rules",
        "content": "Cannes is the birthplace for any number of future Best International Feature Film Oscar nominees, like last year’s Grand Prize winner “Close,” or winners like 2021 Competition entry “Drive My Car.” This year’s possibilities include the UK’s rapturously received German-language from UK filmmaker Jonathan Glazer, “The Zone of Interest;” Argentina’s Un Certain Regard entry “The Delinquents,” a three-hour existential heist movie picked up by Mubi; or Japan’s “Monster,” the latest film from Hirokazu Kore-eda, whose “Shoplifters” scored both the Palme d’Or and an Oscar nomination. However, before they can be nominated they must be submitted — and that, as Academy members well know, is the rub.The demand for reform boils down to this: Too often the decision of Oscar submissions belongs to decision-makers instead of filmmakers, and that can lead to some… frustrating choices. Last year India did not submit “RRR” and Italy declined to select well-reviewed Cannes entry “The Eight Mountains,” which was directed on location in Italy by the Belgian team of Felix van Groeningen and Charlotte Vandermeersch. “If I could change [the Oscars], it’d be this idea to have the category be more open, so any movie could apply for it,” van Groeningen told IndieWire. “Then it would be a process of natural selection.”Countries choose their Oscar picks in different ways. Some appoint small committees; some have a national Academy. In Brazil, Iran, and Russia, the committee are dominated by their governments; even in a democratic country like France, the selection process is dominated by industry powermongers. Cannes director Thierry Fremaux was on the committee for years and was often accused of favoring Cannes titles.This year, among the myriad Academy rule changes was a new rule for Best International Feature Film that requires each country’s Oscar submission selection committee be comprised of 50 percent “artists and or craftspeople from the field of motion pictures.” This doesn’t exactly qualify as radical reform: Prior to its codification as a rule, a 50 percent “guideline” (one that was unavailable to public view) was in place for years. Still, to the extent that countries around the world care about the Oscars, most are likely to comply.Even so, the new rule does little to address how AMPAS should deal with exiled and banned filmmakers, or with otherwise orphaned films that have no home. International Feature Film executive committee co-chairs Danish Oscar-winner Susanne Bier (“In a Better World”) and MoMa’s chief curator of film, Rajendra Roy, who have been deeply researching the processes behind making international Oscar selections, have yet to figure out a solution to these issues. So they started with a smaller step.“The thing that was clear to both of us was that there was a real need for more transparency for submitting countries,” said Roy on the phone. “There’s obviously a need for transparency… there still seemed to be confusion amongst the countries about how to submit. There just wasn’t a lot of consistency, but the thing we needed to be true was that people who make movies, and all those in whatever form that takes, are part of at least 50 percent of that process.”Every year, questions to the Academy abound from selection committees about International Feature Film category awards rules, committee guidelines and criteria, and the submission process. When Bhutan tried to submit for the first time, they had no approved official selection committee. The country needed help from the Academy to establish a selection committee and submit a film. Ultimately, Bhutan earned a surprise nomination for Pawo Choyning Dorji’s “Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom.”Attempts to reform the Academy’s foreign-language selection process have included the 2006 change in which a submitted film no longer had to be in the language of its own home country. That allowed Denmark, for example, to submit the country’s Profile Pictures production “Holy Spider” last year; the film was shot in Persian in Jordan. After Palme d’Or winner “4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days” was passed over for a 2008 nomination, the Academy formed a foreign committee that weighs in on the final selection. That committee was abandoned in 2021, but the Academy expanded the shortlist to 15 and added online viewing to a wider slice of global voters.To manage international submissions, in April 2022 the Academy hired former Sundance programmer Dilcia Barrera as the Academy’s new senior VP of member relations, global outreach, and administration. She works closely with Meredith Shea, a former AMPAS membership and awards exec who returned to the Academy fold this April as chief membership, impact, and industry officer. “It was an important step for the Academy to find the right staff person to step into the role, someone to focus on international,” said Roy.While the Academy has long asked countries to submit selection committee memberships to scrutiny, the official rule plus an identifiable enforcer provides more heft.If Roy has his druthers, the next guideline-that-could-become-a-rule will ask the countries to impose term limits on their selection committees, much like the AMPAS board of governors’ three years. (The Academy suggests six-year cycles separated by two-year hiatuses.) Filmmakers have expressed frustration, Roy said, that there’s often no room for their inclusion.One step at a time. Clearly, the Academy has no plans to throw out the entry model of one film per country anytime soon. For now, Roy said, it’s a matter of finding “ways of making it work better.”",

        "title": "‘In Flames’ Review: This Pakistani Horror Film Shows How the Strings Attached to Gifts Can Strangle You",
        "content": "Editor’s Note: This review originally published during the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Game Theory Films will release “In Flames” on April 12, 2024.“No one gives something for nothing.”All of the evils that emerge over the course of “In Flames” — and there are quite a few of them — stem from that prescient warning that Mariam (Ramesha Nawal) relays to her mother. The 25-year-old medical student is alarmed by the resurfacing of her sleazy Uncle Nasir (Adnan Shah), who has conveniently offered to pay all of their family’s debts after a lifetime of neglecting her and her brother. The family’s financial struggles cause her concerns to fall on deaf ears, but a lot of agony could have been avoided if her mother had just learned the film’s key lesson: some gift horses should be looked in the mouth.Zarrar Kahn’s genre-bending horror movie — which has the well-deserved honor of being the first Pakistani film to premiere in the Directors’ Fortnight in over four decades — is a Kafkaesque saga of niceties gone awry. What begins as a story of a poor family relying on the kindness of their community quickly turns into a hellish tale of how the ground is always shifting underneath you when all of your benefactors have an angle. Inconvenience gives way to discomfort until there’s nothing left but barbarity.Fariha (Bakhtawar Mazhar) has been through a lot. The death of her abusive husband put her in the undesirable position of raising two young children alone in a tiny apartment in Karachi, Pakistan. While she was able to hold down a job as a schoolteacher, her country’s draconian restrictions on women forced her to rely on her own father for financial support. But when he dies, she’s left with a mountain of debt that he spent a lifetime accumulating. Her eldest daughter Mariam is preparing for the final exams that she expects will launch her medical career, but her younger son Bilal is still very much a dependent.So when Uncle Nasir offers to settle all of their father’s accounts with no strings attached, it’s hard to blame her for seeing him as a godsend. But her daughter — whose education and professional ambitions have equipped her with a more modern worldview — is instantly skeptical. She warns Fariha to avoid signing any legal documents without reading them, but her mother isn’t particularly interested in poking holes in the golden parachute. At a certain point, Mariam has no choice but to shrug her concerns off — she has bigger things to worry about.In addition to her studies, the aspiring doctor has allowed herself to cautiously enter a new romance with a boy from the library named Asad (Omar Javaid). While she’s initially hesitant about the distraction he poses, his carefree charms begin to erode her discipline until she’s gleefully ditching obligations to ride his motorcycle to the beach. Between the new relationship and the financial freedom she can see on the horizon, Mariam seems like she’s finally ready to live her life on her own terms.She gets about an hour to enjoy that euphoric feeling before Asad dies in a motorcycle crash on the way home from the beach. Mariam is immediately aware of how much danger the streets pose to a single woman at night, so she has no choice but to hitch a ride with the first cab driver she finds. The man refuses to accept payment for taking her home, creating yet another implied debt that Mariam never asked for.Mariam doesn’t have much time to feel sorry for herself when she gets home, because the family suddenly has much bigger problems. Uncle Nassir has predictably screwed them over and is now claiming that he legally owns their apartment and wants them out immediately. As Mariam and Fariha try to navigate the country’s Byzantine legal system to save their home, they begin receiving frequent visits from ghosts from their past. Mariam keeps hallucinating a zombie version of Asad who makes lewd gestures outside her bedroom window, and her dreams keep taking her back to childhood memories of her mother being abused. The horrors slowly become more and more menacing until the two women realize that they’ll never be able to build a life for themselves until they burn down their old traumas.Kahn’s masterful use of red herrings and subtext creates an environment where nobody ever quite knows where they stand. The film’s most nefarious actors are never outwardly aggressive, opting to use carrots rather than sticks to get what they want. Everyone is always eager to offer Mariam and Fariha a favor in moments of need, which allows them to return with their own irrefutable requests at the most inopportune times. The weaponization of kindness is so prevalent that genuine acts of altruism become indistinguishable from transactional traps.The film layers three separate sources of discomfort — the harsh realities of life as a woman in Pakistan, the universal human urge to be skeptical of unprompted favors and gifts, and the supernatural elements that literally haunt the characters — on top of each other. The result is a story where something feels off at virtually every moment, but you can never quite be sure where the horror is coming from until it’s too late. It’s a seedy ride through a bleak existence that would be entertaining enough to watch with popcorn if it didn’t depict a life that’s all too real for too many people.“In Flames” premiered in the Directors’ Fortnight at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.",

The “Good Fortune” script was completed prior to the WGA strike, which has led to the shelving of “Stranger Things,” “The Penguin,” “The Last of Us,” and more high-profile productions.“Good Fortune” is being billed as Ansari’s feature directorial debut after his “Being Mortal” production fell in limbo as of April 2022 amid actor Bill Murray’s sexual misconduct allegations on the set of the Searchlight Pictures film. Murray has claimed the investigation stemmed from a miscommunication. Seth Rogen is also attached to star in “Being Mortal,” in addition to “Good Fortune.”“Good Fortune” was announced in April 2023. While the plot remains under wraps, production was slated to start principal photography in Los Angeles in May, with Lionsgate aiming to launch sales at Cannes.Ansari also produces “Good Fortune” along with Anthony Katagas (“12 Years a Slave”) and “Master of None” co-creator and showrunner Alan Yang. “Good Fortune” is overseen by Brady Fujikawa and Jon Humphrey. Dan Freedman, Phil Strina, John Biondo, and Matt Leonetti also helped negotiate the deal for Lionsgate.",

        "title": "AI Becomes Him: How De-Aging Progressed from ‘Benjamin Button’ to ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’",
        "content": "De-aging has come a long way, from “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” to “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” in the last 15 years. While “Benjamin Button” won the VFX Oscar for its trailblazing reverse-aging of Brad Pitt, Harrison Ford’s Indy finale (which premiered this week at the Cannes Film Festival ahead of its June 30 theatrical opening) is already being talked up as an Oscar contender for its breakthrough AI-generated de-aging, making the actor look 35 years younger fighting Nazis in the 25-minute opening flashback.With David Fincher’s “Benjamin Button,” digital technology caught up with need, and its success spawned a wave of de-aging that fought off the Uncanny Valley with varying degrees of success. This included Patrick Stewart in “X-Men Origins: Wolverine,” Arnold Schwarzenegger in “Terminator Salvation,” Jeff Bridges in “Tron: Legacy,” Michael Douglas in “Ant-Man,” Kurt Russell in “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,” Samuel L. Jackson in “Captain Marvel,” Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher in “Rogue One: A Star War’s Story,” Sean Young in “Blade Runner 2049,” Will Smith in “Gemini Man,” and Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci in “The Irishman.”Then deepfake started taking off a few years ago, with computer-learning software combining photographs and footage of actors at younger ages to create CG composites of their faces. This AI revolution (an important factor in the current WGA strike) has rapidly evolved to the point of not only achieving high-resolution face replacement through a network of neural skinning but also accurate movement through a more advanced network of neural performance. This means that machine learning has become so sophisticated that after weeks or months of building these neural networks, it delivers rough 3D models in a matter of days.Which brings us to “Dial of Destiny.” What we know so far is that ILM’s AI system analyzed reels of footage of Ford from the first three “Indiana Jones” films (both used and unused) to get the look and performance right for the opening flashback in 1944, before jumping to 1969, where Indy combats a neo-Nazi revival led by Mads Mikkelsen.“We had hundreds of hours of footage of him in close-ups, in mediums, in wides, in every kind of lighting, night and day,” director James Mangold told Total Film. “I could shoot Harrison [with mo-cap dots on his face] on a Monday as, you know, a 79-year-old playing a 35-year-old, and I could see dailies by Wednesday with his head already replaced.”We also know that AI is ushering in a new wave of de-aging. This includes Robert Zemeckis’ upcoming “Here,” adapted from the graphic novel about people who inhabit a single room throughout several decades, which de-ages Tom Hanks and Robin Wright with innovative software from AI studio Metaphysic.As a prelude to our coverage of ILM’s “Dial of Destiny” de-aging, here’s a recap of how far we’ve come in the last 15 years.After years of R&D, Digital Domain cracked the code of aging Pitt’s face with different body actors. Utilizing the studio’s volumetric deformation rig, the animators used micro-expressions to manipulate individual movements. This could be driven by either keyframe animation or image analysis because they were built from Pitt’s own faces. Mova’s Contour multi-camera, high-resolution facial capture system was a key component in this part of the process. The trick was letting Pitt be Pitt. Some of the hurdles were making the animation believable, and tracking and creating a lighting and compositing system so that the heads could be dropped into Claudio Miranda’s cinematography.In addition, for the de-aging sequences between Pitt and Cate Blanchett, Lola FX (which introduced the process in “X-Men: The Last Stand” with an opening flashback featuring a de-aged Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan as Professor X and Magneto) refined its Photoshop-like 2D/3D technique involving skin smoothing and shape warping with improved animation, tracking, and compositing.DD raised its game for performance capturing Bridges as the younger Clu 2.0 avatar in Joseph Kosinki’s sequel. This included improving the workflow, management system, pipeline, and animation. But de-aging the 60-year-old actor 25 years was much harder than reverse-aging Pitt. Although the capturing process and facial animation improved, there was no getting around the problem of trying to recapture Bridges in his prime, even if he was driving the performance. His physiology was different and you couldn’t hide the fact that it was older Bridges uncomfortably fitting into his younger self. The result was artificial, but then so was Clu 2.0, who wasn’t human anyway.ILM’s controversial de-aging of the late Cushing (Grand Moff Tarkin) and Fisher (Princess Leia) in “Rogue One” without the participation of the actors proved problematic. The tech wasn’t there yet to create younger versions of the characters with only old footage and mo-capped doubles. But it was a useful exercise in testing ILM’s evolving facial capture system and animation rig. ILM tried the procedure again in 2019 with Mark Hamill and Fisher for “The Rise of Skywalker,” but the results still weren’t impressive.There was slight improvement, however, with the cameo of a de-aged Luke at the end of “The Mandalorian” Season 2. This featured the brief participation of Hamill, who was shot on set in alternating scenes with a double before stepping into a special lighting rig called “The Egg” for facial lighting adjustments. Lola handled the de-aging with a deepfake used for reference only. Better still was Luke’s appearance in “The Book of Boba Fett,” where deepfake played a much larger role.MPC was part of the Oscar-winning VFX team responsible for the impressive de-aging of Young. Body double Loren Peta played the young Rachael (in costume, makeup, and with dotted face) and performed on set for the two-minute sequence with Ford (reprising Deckard) and Jared Leto (as replicant manufacturer Wallace). She was directed by Denis Villeneuve with Young on set for reference. The facial capture of Peta and Young was done on a Saturday in Budapest, where the film was shot. Production stills and scenes from the original “Blade Runner” were used for reference to create an identical match.Then, about four weeks before the end of production, they decided to insert footage of Rachael from the original “Blade Runner” into the scene, which set the bar higher. MPC drilled into Young’s mannerisms even further. The director, though, envisioned a three-beat arc for this surprise reunion between Deckard and Rachael: confidence, longing, and rejection when she doesn’t measure up to Deckard’s expectation. But when the animated performance didn’t measure up to Roger Deakins’ beautiful Oscar-winning cinematography, the animators mimicked Young’s original performance until they nailed the emotion.It was a banner year for de-aging in 2019 with three films (“The Irishman,” “Gemini Man,” and “Captain Marvel”) and three distinct techniques on display. Lola, the industry leader as a result of its extensive work for Marvel, reached a milestone with de-aging Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. This marked the first time they didn’t use a digital double. Because the actor performed in two-thirds of the film, it would’ve been too time-consuming and too difficult to match performances for every shot. Fortunately, the actor aged well. Lola had to modify its methods to accommodate the number of shots, and used some makeup to pull back the skin on his neck, but relied on the actor’s performance with no grafting — just slimming and tightening and smoothing over.Weta Digital constructed its best digital human yet for Ang Lee’s high frame rate/3D action-adventure, as 50-year-old Will Smith fights 23-year-old Will Smith in a face-off between a hitman and his clone. Smith played the aging Henry as well as his clone, Junior, who appeared in more than half the movie, with the actor channeling his younger self.Weta created the CG Junior by studying the morphology of aging as it applied to the actor. They then made great strides in skin and eye work. The animators created new procedural software that simulates areas between the pores and along the natural fall lines for a more realistic look. They also modeled a dark retina for the eyes to reveal more depth, and provided an additional film surface that sits across the eye for greater fidelity. The result arguably achieved the first fully convincing digital human.For Martin Scorsese’s mob epic, ILM created a breakthrough light-based, markerless facial capture system to make Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci look decades younger as hitman Frank Sheeran, Teamsters leader Jimmy Hoffa, and Philly crime boss Russell Bufalin. That’s because the director and star demanded an unobtrusive system with a light capture footprint and no reshoots in a controlled environment. In addition, they only showed finished renders to Scorsese, so there were no key-frame animated enhancements.The camera system and companion software that ILM developed captured the actors’ facial performances on set and then translated those unaltered performances to full CG versions of their younger selves with its proprietary models. ILM’s special three-camera rig (termed “the three-headed monster” by cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto for its bulkiness) consisted of two witness cameras on either side of the director’s camera.However, despite the impressive Oscar-nominated VFX work, the de-aging couldn’t overcome the fact that it still looked like three old men with young faces. This created a disconnect between appearance and performance, which ILM apparently solved with their AI-generated tech on “Dial of Destiny.” But not before hiring YouTube deepfake expert Shamook after showing what he could do with de-aged Luke in “The Mandalorian” and “The Irishman.”",

        "title": "‘Master Gardener’ Writer-Director Paul Schrader Still Packs a Punch",
        "content": "With “Master Gardner,” writer-director Paul Schrader completes what has been dubbed his “Lonely Man” trilogy — but the man behind “American Gigolo” and “The Mosquito Coast” has returned to the same preoccupations and themes over his long career. The only thing that’s really changed is his approach to filmmaking.“The last three films I’ve made in about 20 days each,” Schrader told IndieWire’s Filmmaker Toolkit podcast. “I’m shooting more quote-unquote film — even though we don’t shoot film — I’m shooting more images and getting more images in the chip to, like we say, in the 20 days than I did in 40.”Part of that leanness is attributed to Schrader’s understanding of what is and isn’t needed, even before arriving on set. His scripts are now a tight 70-80 pages, while in the early ’80s they tended to hover around 115. “When you’re working on a tight budget, and you’re the writer as well as the director, you can start to smell a scene that’s gonna get cut,” Schrader said. “And if you can spot one coming in the writing stage, the rewriting, even in the prep, just cut it right then and there.”That approach is evident in “Master Gardner,” starring Joel Edgerton as a horticulturist working for Sigourney Weaver and harboring secrets, who is tasked with taking on her great-niece as an apprentice. It’s the final film in what Schrader has called an “accidental trilogy,” completing a cycle initiated by “First Reformed” and “The Card Counter” but in many ways an extension of Schrader’s work since he wrote “Taxi Driver.”“As you get older, the metaphors change, so that lonely, angry kid in the taxicab is now a former Proud Boy or a former torturer, you know?” Schrader said before referring to the number of “hot buttons on the console” in “Master Gardner,” all of which he joked would have been lost in the furor if he’d cast Kevin Spacey in the lead. “I said to the producer, ‘You know, if we really wanna get them not thinking about [the] May-December [romance] and not thinking about the white nationalist, let’s cast Kevin Spacey. Then they’ll really be fucked up. Their heads will be spinning so long they won’t stop.'”Not that concern over touchy subjects in his scripts is anything new; in his original “Rolling Thunder” script, William Devane’s Vietnam vet was much more explicitly racist until it was toned down. That film’s reputation has increased over the years and it might get renewed attention soon, according to Schrader. “Quentin [Tarantino] — this may have changed — but about a month ago he was making a film, had something to do with filmmaking in the ’70s. And part of this, he’s going to use clips from movies from the ’70s, but he’s also gonna remake movies from the ’70s. And he asked me, ‘Can I redo the ending of “Rollling Thunder?”’ And I said, ‘Yeah, go for it. I’d love to see you redo the ending of “Rolling Thunder.”’ Who knows whether he actually will or not. But it was something that was tickling his imagination in a very Tarantino-esque way.” Whether Tarantino called about using “Rolling Thunder” in his much-discussed 10th film “The Movie Critic” remains to be seen, but his alleged interest only proves the powerful hold Schrader’s singular cinematic vision still has — including, now, “Master Gardener.”",

        "title": "‘The Zone of Interest’ Review: Jonathan Glazer’s Holocaust Anti-Drama Is a Chilling Look at the Banality of Evil",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. A24 releases the film in select theaters on Friday, December 15.Holocaust cinema has so implicitly existed in the shadow of a single question that it would no longer seem worth asking if not for the fact that it’s never been answered: How do you depict an atrocity? The most urgent and indelible examples of the form offer equally simple yet perfectly contradictory responses. Documentaries like “Shoah” and Alain Resnais’ “Night and Fog” suggest that you don’t, while historical epics like “Schindler’s List” insist that you must. If the latter argues that seeing is believing, the former maintains that seeing wouldn’t help — that some things are too unfathomable for the human eye to comprehend from a distance, and can only hope to be understood by their absence. A tsunami might not seem much bigger than any other wave if you stare at it from a distant shore, but watching the ocean water as it gets sucked back into the sea reveals the full immensity of what’s coming. A narrative Holocaust drama that’s defined by its rigorous compartmentalization and steadfast refusal to show any hint of explicit violence, Jonathan Glazer’s profoundly chilling “The Zone of Interest” stands out for how formally the film splits the difference between the two opposite modes of its solemn genre — a genre that may now be impossible to consider without it. No Holocaust movie has ever been more committed to illustrating the banality of evil, and that’s because no Holocaust movie has ever been more hell-bent upon ignoring evil altogether. There is a literal concrete wall that separates Glazer’s characters from the horrors next door, and not once does his camera dare to peek over it for a better look. It doesn’t even express the faintest hint of that desire.“The Zone of Interest” opens with a long overture that forces the audience to sit in pure darkness for several minutes on end as the first pearls of Mica Levi’s elusive score clatter together over the soundtrack. The effect doesn’t create a distance between then and now so much as it elides one; when the first proper scene of the film begins, it feels like an act of unblinking. Our eyes were closed for a time and then opened again, but that’s all — nothing has been filtered through or clarified by the lens of history. The “authorless” quality of Glazer’s images (to borrow the word he uses in the film’s press notes) frees the characters within them from the emptiness of moral judgment. The evil on display is never the least bit in doubt, but its failure to recognize itself as such is only so able to take shape in the absence of its limiting obviousness. Rudolf Höss (Christian Friedel), his wife Hedwig (“Toni Erdmann” star Sandra Hüller, seen here in an equally fearless performance of a very different stripe), and their five young children enjoy an idyllic picnic on the bank of the river that runs along their house. The sky is blue and the birds are chirping — as Kurt Vonnegut would insist they continue to do, even in the wake of a massacre. When the family retires to their large stucco villa (which is surrounded by a veritable forest of lilacs and ladybirds, and a swimming pool that has its own slide), the kids surprise Rudolf with a canoe for his birthday. The Aryan fantasy of it all isn’t subtle, but its most ominous details are easy to overlook in a film that refuses to pay them any special attention. It may be a few minutes before you begin to notice the barbed wire that’s coiled atop the far wall of Hedwig’s garden, or the smoke stacks that stick out into the skyline just beyond it. It will be a few minutes longer before an errant line of dialogue confirms that the Höss family lives on the border of history’s most notorious concentration camp, because Rudolf is the commandant of Auschwitz. To call this a reveal would be overstating Glazer’s emphasis on that information. Rudolf and Hedwig have turned that house into the only true home their family has ever known — a self-contained Eden on the far edge of hell — and by the time the film begins, the muffled shouts and occasional spray of gunfire that carry over the wall are as easy to tune out as the clatter that comes out of any construction site. The house is pressure-sealed away from the camp as if Auschwitz were on the other side of an airplane window: right there but a million miles away. Turbulence is unavoidable, but the powers that be have engineered away the possibility of even the slightest crack. Everything in this film is strictly peripheral.Much less mindful of plot than the Martin Amis novel from which it’s been (very loosely) adapted, “The Zone of Interest” is a far cry from the kind of story we’ve been conditioned to expect from a premise like this. A desperate Jew never escapes into the Höss family house in order to impress their humanity upon Hedwig or her kids. Nobody has a sudden change of heart, or even experiences anything that might hope to provoke one. When Rudolf is reassigned to an office in Berlin for irrelevant bureaucratic reasons — the closest thing this movie has to a conventional narrative incident — Hedwig throws a shit fit because she doesn’t want to abandon the perfect home she’s built for her precious Nazi children (whose inherited obliviousness might spark your fleeting sympathies). The brief scene where she chews out a maid over a puddle of water on the floor is the movie’s only real flirtation with on-screen violence.It’s been 10 years since the release of Glazer’s previous feature “Under the Skin,” and “The Zone of Interest” continues that (comparatively hyper-commercial) movie’s forensic obsession with the faultlines of our empathy in a world where it so often falls into the cracks. One is predatory and seductive, the other is placid and ambient. In “Under the Skin,” Scarlett Johansson’s monstrousness is challenged by the gradual emergence of her humanity. In “The Zone of Interest,” Rudolf and Hedwig’s humanity is challenged by the gradual emergence of their monstrousness. In “Under the Skin,” Glazer’s alien protagonist comes to recognize itself in others. In “The Zone of Interest,” his Aryan family explicitly denies themselves that chance. That being said, the director’s gaze is even more alien here than ever before. In an evolution of the hidden camera tricks he once used to lure real men into Johansson’s van, Glazer shot “The Zone of Interest” with 10 fixed cameras that were placed within the house where roughly 75 percent of the movie takes place, relying on focus-pullers to operate them via remote control. Chronologically overlapping scenes would be shot in different rooms at the same time, from the same distance, and with the same natural or diegetic light — regardless of their dramatic emphasis. The approach results in a paradoxical effect: The movie feels guided by a human spirit, but absent of a human touch (a disconnect that proves uniquely compelling, and further embarrasses the limitations of AI). The process instills a flattening evenness into a film where the lack of drama becomes deeply sickening unto itself. Watching Rudolf walk the halls of his house or listen to Hedwig talk about spas from their separate beds isn’t so queasy because the camera doesn’t judge them, but rather because it’s literally incapable of doing so. It sees these characters the same way they see themselves, which is to say both clearly and not at all. Ironically, it’s because of Glazer’s monk-like discipline that “The Zone of Interest” becomes most striking for its few occasional flourishes. In what feels like his version of Spielberg’s girl in the red coat, Glazer uses thermal imaging to watch a local child steal into the night and leave food for the Jews who work the fields of Auschwitz. Later, after a coughing fit that evokes memories of Anwar Congo in “The Act of Killing,” Glazer suddenly introduces an even more dramatic break from the film’s established style — one that returns us to the dialectic between depicting an atrocity and tracing the chalk outline of one.Do we have to choose, or is it possible that one method can be used to instigate the other? “The Zone of Interest” insists that all of history’s most abominable moments have been permitted by people who didn’t have to see them, and while the film’s ultimate staying power has yet to be determined, its vision of normality is — as Hannah Arendt once described that phenomenon — “more terrifying than all the atrocities put together.”  “The Zone of Interest” premiered in Competition at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. A24 will release it in theaters in the U.S.",

        "content": "“Sicario” almost had the same location as “Spring Breakers.”Denis Villeneuve‘s 2015 crime drama centered on Mexican drug cartels was almost filmed in Fort Lauderdale, according to cinematographer Roger Deakins. The Oscar winner recalled the filmmakers having to convince producers that it was worth shooting in Mexico City in lieu of Juarez even due to the high cost of insurance.“We had to convince some producers to go to Mexico City because they didn’t want us to go there for insurance,” Deakins said during a panel discussion moderated by Annette Insdorf at the 92nd Street Y.Deakins’ wife and collaborator James Deakins added, “They wanted Fort Lauderdale.”Deakins continued, “I was actually in a production meeting and I said, ‘Has anybody read the script?’ So anyway, they let us go to Mexico City for a few days. I have to say, the cops in Mexico City were fantastic. We found some of the locations in the morning before we were going to shoot. There’s a scene outside the prison and Denis and I were riding around saying, ‘This prison is fantastic, can we shoot here?’ And it wasn’t until 10 o’clock in the morning when we actually got permission and managed to do two shots so that’s what we got but it was really worth it.”“Sicario,” written by “Yellowstone” creator Taylor Sheridan and stars Emily Blunt as an FBI special agent who joins two CIA officers, played by Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro, to take down the leader of a cartel. The film was Oscar-nominated for Best Cinematography and spurred sequel “Sicario: Day of the Soldado,” helmed by Stefano Sollima. A third film, titled “Sicario: Capos,” is reportedly in development.Brolin gave an update on the possible trilogy installment in April 2023, saying, “‘Sicario 3,’ we’ve been trying to get that right and get that going, but why hasn’t it happened? How long can you wait? A tough movie to get made even though the two made money, and people are asking about it all the time.”",

        "title": "‘How to Have Sex’ Review: When Spring Break Goes Very Bad",
        "content": "Less an instructional film than a sloppy-drunk after school special about a girls trip gone wrong, Molly Manning Walker’s “How to Have Sex” folds a nuanced look at the pressures and permissiveness of teenage friendships inside a frustratingly didactic story about the vagaries of consent. Needless to say, that’s not the movie Walker’s three 16-year-old heroines were hoping to be in when they arrived on the Greek island of Malia for the kind of boot-and-rally bacchanalia that British kids have turned into a rite of passage. They signed up for “Spring Breakers,” only to find themselves stranded in something closer to an episode of “Skins.” It’s not their fault. Best friends Tara, Em, and Skye have no way of knowing they’ve walked into a trap. They can’t hear the muted soundscape that Walker creates for them as they arrive on their first beach; they can’t see that cinematographer Nicolas Canniccioni is shooting them with a detached remove that portends social horror even more clearly than it promises sexual hedonism (it should be noted that first-time director Walker is a gifted DP herself, having recently lensed the Sundance highlight “Scrapper”). “Best! Holiday! Ever!” the girls chant at each other during the cab ride from the airport, oblivious to the dangers of deciding that in advance. They’ve also pre-determined that Tara — the trio’s last remaining virgin — will “get laid” by the time they go home, which proves to be another fraught case of putting the cart before the horse (it’s telling that these ultra-modern zoomers suddenly talk like the boys from “American Pie” whenever the subject turns to sex). Tara seems on board with the plan, and it’s not as if it’ll be hard to find a willing partner for a feisty blonde with high cheekbones and a low-cut neon top. After all, the pool at the girls’ hotel is shaped like a giant penis, and the stench of Axe body spray rises off the surface of the water like the mist over a lake at dawn. Half the teens in London have gone on holiday while awaiting the results of the GCSE exams that will determine the course of their adult lives, and you probably couldn’t throw a bottle of Smirnoff Ice without hitting some horned up meathead who would be happy to assist Tara while deciding on his next unfortunate neck tattoo. Alas, there’s no guarantee that any of Tara’s potential suitors know how to have sex any better than she does. Odds are they don’t even care — not when so many of these kids have been socialized to think of sex as a consecration of their own self-worth. “How to Have Sex” is at its best during its bass-heavy first half, when the thrust of Walker’s attention is focused on the nuances of Tara’s friendship with Skye and Em. As played by the excellent Mia McKenna Bruce, Tara is an unusually nuanced lead for such a morally straightforward movie. Street smart but academically challenged, Tara is brash and bull-headed in a way that disguises her relative innocence — as well as her private fear that the GCSE results will put her on a very different path than her besties. The pressure Tara feels to join the club and have sex is even more intense now that she feels like even the smallest fissure between she and her friends might fracture them apart forever, and it doesn’t help that Tara — like so many of the people she meets in Malia — seems privately convinced that everyone else is having more fun than she is.Maybe if she has another bathtub-sized blue drink everything will fall into place. Maybe if she finally gets laid she’ll be able to postpone her actual loss of innocence: The crushing realization that her life may not live up to the dreams she once had for it. The other two members of the clique are either too cynical or not cynical enough. Em (Enva Lewis) is a disappointingly underwritten sweetheart who’s too busy snogging her lesbian crush to notice that Tara is going through it, while Skye (Lara Peake) is an insecure bully whose appetite for deep-fried cigarettes is only matched by her need to undercut Tara at every opportunity. She’s the kind of girl who only seems interested in fucking the guys her friends like, so when Tara hits it off with the bleach-blond Mancurian who’s staying in the next room over, it’s only a matter of time before Skye casually tells him that Tara has never had sex before. His name is Badger, he’s played by Shaun Thomas, and he basically looks like what might happen if Ben Platt made 300 bad decisions in a row. Nevertheless, Badger’s good-hearted nature is blindingly obvious from the moment he appears on screen; likewise, all the booze in the world can’t hide the fact that his best mate Paddy (Barry Keoghan look-alike Samuel Bottomley) is an absolute “nightmare of a guy.” On their own, these characters are thuddingly one-dimensional for a movie so attuned to the gray areas of sexual assault, and they soon come to epitomize how the movie around them fails to support Tara’s struggle with the drama it deserves. But there’s something painful and true about Badger’s attachment to Paddy in spite of everything, just as it makes sense that Tara would still fear growing apart from someone as spiteful as Skye: At that age, friends aren’t people you like so much as the entire context of your social existence, and losing them can feel tantamount to losing a part of yourself. A semi-effective reminder that consent isn’t necessarily the end of the conversation, Walker’s film is far more powerful as a portrait of the things that people allow of themselves (and their friends) in the interest of self-preservation. Even during the clumsiest moments of its overwrought third act, “How to Have Sex” never loses sight of what these characters are willing to overlook, or why. And after alternating between several different modes of cringe cinema for most of its first 90 minutes (is it possible to get alcohol poisoning second-hand?), Walker’s debut ends on a soberingly painful note that makes the whole thing seem like more than the sum of its parts, as Tara, at long last, sees herself with a clarity that she’ll be able to keep forever — a valuable souvenir rescued from a holiday that she’ll never be able to forget. “How to Have Sex” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. MUBI will release it in the United States later this year.",

        "title": "Kathleen Kennedy and James Mangold Stand with the WGA at ‘Indiana Jones’ Cannes Press Conference",
        "content": "The press conference for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” was largely an obsequious affair on Saturday, with one journalist telling Harrison Ford “You’re still hot” and asking about his workout routine, and another wearing an “Indiana Jones” t-shirt telling the actor, “Thank you for existing.”When IndieWire got the microphone, we chose instead to address producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall to get their take on the WGA strike, noting that a movie like “Indiana Jones” wouldn’t be able to go into production right now. “I would like to see the whole situation resolved by truly being in an environment where people can talk about what are some really complicated issues right now that are affecting the entire industry,” Kennedy said. “But when it comes to acknowledging the importance of writing, I think everybody up here demonstrates that you can’t do any of this without great writing. So all of us who make movies, who create anything on television, I am in full support — I know most people are in full support — of the writers getting what they deserve.”Kennedy also hinted at the conversation surrounding AI technology that’s central to current negotiations. “I think what’s the meta issue here is how is that being impacted by an industry that’s in the midst of change, both technologically and just the basic aspects of how we work,” she said. “That’s going to take time and I think that’s what everybody’s getting ready for — to take the time that’s necessary to try to ensure that everybody can articulate what those feelings are and try to arrive at a resolution around alignment.”Director James Mangold also weighed in. “Of course, we’re not writing now,” he said. “Writers are often, because they’re first in the process, they’re first to be forgotten. I think that is true in so many parts of our life in their struggle to get what’s fair for everyone.”Ford, meanwhile, fielded a few meaningful questions about his decision to move on from the franchise at the age of 80. “Is it not evident?” he asked. “I need to sit down and rest a little bit. But I love to work and I love this character and I love what it brought to my life.”He also addressed the de-aging technology used in the film to make him look like the earlier incarnation of the character. “This iteration of technology has evolved to the point where it seems to me very realistic, and I know that it is my face. It’s not Photoshop magic. That’s what I looked like 35 years ago because Lucasfilm has every frame of film that we’ve made together over all of these years. This process of scientific mining of this library was put to good use. It’s just a trick unless it’s supported by story and it sticks out like a sore thumb if it’s not real.”",

        "title": "Bob Iger Has Watched ‘Dial of Destiny’ Five Times — and Says More Indy Franchise Extensions Are Possible",
        "content": "At the Cannes world premiere for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” Disney CEO Bob Iger watched the film for the fifth time. Before the Lumière theater screening, 80-year-old Harrison Ford received an honorary Palme d’Or from the festival and received the loudest applause of the night. However, in his introduction to the tribute before the movie, Cannes artistic director Fremaux singled out Iger for applause of his own. “The CEO, or whatever,” Fremaux said, stopping himself. “The legendary Bob Iger!”Fremaux’s awkward wording may reflect Iger’s unusual path to this moment. One year ago, when the big American studio chief at Cannes was newly minted WarnerMedia Discovery head David Zaslav in attendance for “Elvis,” Iger was a retired Disney executive whose next move was unclear.In November, he made a surprise return to the role with the sudden outing of successor Bob Chapek, whose disinterest in talent relations rubbed Hollywood the wrong way. By contrast, Iger spent years building the opposite reputation, and his Cannes presence seemed to reflect as much. At the “Indiana Jones” afterparty Thursday night, he told IndieWire that the studio could consider further extensions of the “Indiana Jones” franchise, even if the fifth edition allows Ford’s portrayal a graceful exit.“The last movie was here 15 years ago,” he said, referring to Steven Spielberg’s “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” which premiered at Cannes in 2008. “So we’ll see.”Disney’s presence at Cannes goes beyond “Indiana Jones,” which opens theatrically June 28. The festival also selected Pixar’s “Elemental” for its closing-night slot, marking the first time that a Pixar movie has premiered at Cannes since “Inside Out” in 2015. Specialty division Searchlight is also on the ground with several executives scouting for acquisitions in the lineup and the market.Disney will see 7,000 layoffs in 2023 and when we asked Iger about the future of Searchlight, he declined comment. (Specifically, he said, “You’re asking a lot of questions” and then walked away.)On Disney’s second-quarter earnings call, Iger said Hulu would receive a tile on Disney+, which suggests that Searchlight’s adult-audience dramas will have a sturdy home within the studio’s streaming future.As for “Indiana Jones,” the movie was a hot ticket, with many journalists fighting for spots until the last minute and industry execs sneaking away from other festival responsibilities for a blockbuster indulgence. Among the figures spotted milling about the party were TIFF CEO Cameron Bailey, Academy president Janet Yang, Netflix film executive Adam Del Deo, and director Steve McQueen.Beyond Cannes, the movie’s commercial prospects are unclear. It’s unlikely to enjoy the same history-making success that found last year’s Cannes premiere “Top Gun: Maverick” grossing over $1 billion, but the launch follows a similar template. In 2022, Tom Cruise was honored with a tribute ahead of his high-profile premiere; this time, it was Ford’s turn, and the star appeared visibly moved after his work was surveyed in an extended montage of clips before the movie.In a special Cannes twist, the highlight reel opened with the actor’s unique connection to French cinema, with Ford appearing in Agnes Varda’s 1995 documentary “The World of Jacques Demy,” recalling how he went to a Los Angeles sex shop with Demy in hopes of landing a role in the director’s “Model Shop.” That was in the mid-‘60s, and Ford instead went on to become one of America’s most iconic leading men, careening through the ‘70s in standouts like “American Graffiti” before cementing his stature as Han Solo in 1977’s “Star Wars.” By the time he picked up a fedora for Spielberg with “Raiders of the Lost Ark” in 1981, he was one of Hollywood’s most bankable stars.Spielberg and George Lucas maintained tight control of the franchise for decades, but for this would-be final entry the director and producer handed the reins to James Mangold. A blockbuster director in his own right thanks to “Wolverine,” Mangold’s even-handed approach may not please critics but it works overtime to deliver a nostalgic tribute to the character. It’s likely to resonate with fans in much the same way that Disney resurrected “Star Wars” fandom with “The Force Awakens” in 2015. The final entry tracks Indy post-retirement as he trails his goddaughter (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) on a dangerous path to track down an ancient artifact from the Archimedes era. The movie marks Waller-Bridge’s first major role since her hit show “Fleabag” ended its two-season run in 2019, but it’s mostly focused on payoff for “Indiana Jones” fans who found the whole “nuking the fridge” swings of the last entry too off-putting.That sequel grossed $790.7 million on a $185 million budget; “Dial of Destiny” cost a reported $300 million, which means the pressure is greater this time around. Nevertheless, Mangold — who first came to Cannes for the Directors Fortnight premiere of his debut “Heavy” in 1995 — told IndieWire that he was gratified with the results.“This was the least stressful movie I’ve done,” he said, adding that he pushed for the studio to take the Cannes route. “We wanted this.”He was still livid about rumors of reshoots that cropped up last December. “That’s the thing about all this Twitterverse bullshit,” he said. “This movie was done six months ago.” (However, he added, he was color-timing it until earlier this week.) Asked about his current Twitter habits, Mangold said, “I’m trying to do it less.”While the filmmaker has a writing credit on the movie, he said he didn’t foresee any issue promoting it at the festival or beyond due to the WGA strike. “I’m finished with the writing aspect of it,” he said.Whatever happens next, Mangold and Ford certainly looked content with their first taste of public response. At the end of the screening, Mangold teared up as Fremaux handed him the mic.“This film was made by friends,” he said, flanked by Iger, Ford, and other cast members. “It’s probably hard for you to believe that a movie this big can be made by friends, but it was. It was made out of love, it was made out of devotion to what came before it, and it was made with tremendous trust from both people on both sides of me that let us play and let us make something strange and hopefully you felt was wonderful that you could enjoy, and let us carry on the legacy of these great movies that preceded us.” He stopped himself and looked at Ford. “Not in your case, certainly,” Mangold said.Ford has been feted at festivals many times over the years (he received a lifetime achievement award from the Locarno Film Festival in 2011), but the scale of the Cannes tribute seemed to elicit genuine emotion from the actor when he took the stage.“They say when you’re about to die, you see your life flash before your eyes, and I just saw a great part of my life flash before my eyes,” he said, referring to the montage. He told the audience. After singling out wife Calista Flockhart in the audience and telling her that he loved her, he turned back to the room. “I love you, too,” he said. “Thank you for giving my life purpose.”",

        "title": "Josh Hamilton Applauds HBO for Spearheading Indie ‘Reality’ Without an ‘Algorithm’ for Viewership",
        "content": "Independent films remain up against the reality of algorithm-focused filmmaking.“Reality” star Josh Hamilton applauded writer-director Tina Satter for staying committed to telling the true story of NSA whistleblower Reality Winner onscreen. Sydney Sweeney stars as Reality in the HBO film centered on the events of June 3, 2017, during which the former NSA specialist was interrogated by FBI agents in her own home. Satter used the real transcript from the encounter as the script for the play “Is This a Room,” which was later turned into the HBO film out May 29 and starring Sweeney, Hamilton, and Marchánt Davis.“Tina Satter was just a downtown New York theater artist who came across this transcript and thought, ‘Oh, I can do something with this’ and presented it in a really particular way that really makes a statement and creates art. She didn’t have millions of dollars,” Hamilton, who plays an FBI agent, told IndieWire during the film’s red carpet premiere in New York this week. “I think that’s inspiring for any young artist who wants to make something about what they see going on in the world and might feel overwhelmed with how to get it done. And she just did it. That’s usually how indies get to be made.”Hamilton added, “There’s not millions of dollars going into developing and trying to figure out what people want and the algorithm of how to get the most viewers. The fact that it’s here now on HBO is amazing but that certainly was not the game plan.”The “Eighth Grade” star continued, “There’s certain practical things about shooting indies […] because you have so little time and so little money, there’s no sitting around. You’re just there to work. It kind of keeps everyone focused and their energy up. I like to stay in the zone. It feels inspiring, especially for [‘Reality’] particularly.”Writer-director Satter added to IndieWire that Reality Winner herself was the inspiration behind the film, calling the unnamed source a “singular, interesting person” who changed the course of history.“We are in a particular moment in American history,” Satter said. “The action she took really centers her.”During the Q&A panel following the film’s premiere at MoMA, lead actress Sweeney admitted that she was not “familiar” with the story behind the whistleblower.“I was completely blown away by the fact that it was a real transcript,” Sweeney said. “You can’t write dialogue like this. Once I realized this was the real conversation, I knew I had to dig even deeper and figure out what it was.”",

        "title": "‘Asphalt City’ Review: Sean Penn Is a Jaded Paramedic in Miserably Bleak Drama",
        "content": "Editor’s Note: This review originally published during the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, when “Asphalt City” was titled “Black Flies.” Vertical Entertainment and Roadside Attractions will release “Asphalt City” in U.S. theaters on March 29, 2024.Forget banging pots and pans outside of your window at 7 p.m. every night, Jean-Stéphane Sauvaire’s “Black Flies” is here to give New York City’s paramedics the tribute they deserve. And this isn’t the kind of kumbaya, we’re all in this together, let’s honor the real heroes celebration that helped civilians feel like they were doing their part during the worst days of the pandemic. No, this is a hardcore, dead behind the eyes, I’ll see you in Hell salute to the medical technicians who risk their humanity to save other people’s lives; it’s a movie that wants to make “Bringing Out the Dead” feel like “Barb and Star Go to Vista del Mar.” We’re talking Sean Penn as a grizzled first responder who’s losing his faith, and Tye Sheridan as the pure-hearted rookie partner who gets so deep in the shit that he starts choking his nameless girlfriend during sex. We’re talking Michael Pitt in full “I’m walkin’ here!” mode as an EMT who likes to play god as soon as he gets a patient inside of his ambulance, and Mike Tyson — perfectly convincing in the few moments he’s on screen! — as the captain who’s in charge of holding this operation together. We’re talking abused dogs, eight seconds of sunlight, and a half-drowned corpse so horribly decomposed that you’ll turn to your date and whisper “those are the black flies” only to realize that they walked out 20 minutes earlier. As might be expected from the France-born, Bushwick-based director who’s made his name on well-crafted misery spirals like 2017’s “A Prayer Before Dawn,” Sauvaire’s “Black Flies” is such an unrelentingly bleak look inside the busted gut of the American healthcare system that its posturing honesty soon curdles into something that’s hard to believe. Paramedics might welcome a film that shines a harsh light into the darkest recesses of their work — a film that isn’t afraid to explore the toll that it takes, the pittance that it pays, or the thanklessness that it offers them at the end of even the most brutal shift — but this clumsy marathon of plotless miseries is so grueling and one-note that it seems determined to numb us more than the job itself ever could. “Black Flies” is based on Shannon Burke’s 2008 novel of the same name, and I will do that book the kindness of assuming that Ryan King and Ben Mac Brown’s screenplay has sanded away many of its subtleties. Sauvaire’s movie begins with fresh-faced rookie Ollie Cross (Sheridan) waking up from a bad dream in the back of an ambulance and launching directly into a living nightmare somewhere in Brownsville or East New York. If the character’s last name doesn’t sufficiently convey his street-level Jesus complex, maybe it would help to know that he wears a jacket emblazoned with huge golden angel wings whenever he’s off-duty (to match the painting of a fallen angel that he keeps framed in the rundown Chinatown room he’s renting in order to save cash for med school). That Cross is ready to bear the world’s sick and dying on his shoulders does little to endear him to his new colleagues; nor does the fact that he’s hoping to work his miracles in a white coat somewhere far away from the mean streets of Brooklyn as soon as he passes the MCAT. That makes Ollie a natural foil for his partner Gene “Rut” Rutkokvsky (Penn), who’s been stuck in the job since before 9/11. Rut has either seen it all or stopped looking for what’s left, but despite the crustiness he’s developed over the course of a career that’s cost him more marriages than his most recent ex-wife can count (shout out to Katherine Waterston’s one-scene cameo), he warms to his guileless new partner after Ollie laughs at Rut’s favorite pedophile joke — something to remember the next time you’re trying to break the ice with a paramedic who’s rushing you to the hospital. Penn may be playing a pencil-thin archetype, but the early stretches of “Black Flies” serve as a potent reminder of his gifts as a performer. His performance nimbly walks the fine line between hardened and heartless, and the movie works best whenever it wonders if Rut will be able to save himself more successfully than he does any of the people he and Cross are called upon to help every night. It’s hardly a spoiler to say that our heroes don’t have a very high success rate, as many of the most vulnerable New Yorkers would sooner die than call for medical care they know they can’t afford. Indeed, Sauvaire’s characters spend most of the movie shuttling corpses to Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, or clearing unhoused people out of places where their presence is unwanted. Occasionally they do something that would seem to qualify as a win (e.g. helping an abused woman whose husband claims she fell down the stairs), but Rut can’t seem to resolve those situations without royally fucking things up on his way out the door. It’s not that he’s bad at his job so much as he’s starting to question the good it’s doing. Cross soon comes to know the feeling, as we infer from the cleansing, frequent sex he has with a woman whose name he never bothers to ask (Raquel Nave). These scenes are presented in an obliquely beautiful meshwork of bare tits and hard thrusting, as gifted cinematographer David Ungaro shoots them in the gauzy and fractured handheld style you might expect from a fly-on-the-wall film that mostly focuses on women as vessels for male trauma.Despite the obviousness of its narrative trajectory, “Black Flies” is less interested in telling a conventional story than it is in tracing the slow descent from doing the lord’s work to becoming the devil’s envoy (Pitt’s metal-head paramedic illustrates the worst-case scenario, though his performance is just cracked enough to create some interesting textures). What little plot the movie has to offer only kicks in after Rut and Cross are presented with the opportunity to help a woman — played by captivating “Catch the Fair One” star Kali Ries — deliver her baby. That obviously goes wrong in more ways than you would ever want to imagine, as Rut gets stuck at the crossroads between saving people and sparing them the trouble. There’s no denying that America’s obscene disregard for the health and safety of its citizens might lead a first responder to believe that they’re on the front lines of an unwinnable fight, but indelicate fiction has a way of making life’s most unbearable truths seem like the stuff of fantasy. After watching this movie swirl down the drain for 90 minutes, the sight of Sean Penn stepping into a decrepit bathroom while holding the fate of a premature, HIV-positive baby in his cragged hands can’t help but feel suffocatingly overwrought; instead of sobering you to attention, the scene only exposes how artificially Sauvaire’s film has blocked out anything that might pull its characters back from the brink. It’s a choice made in the service of a climactic scene that predictably floods Rut in the light at the end of the tunnel, as “Black Flies” reverses two hours of “you can’t save everyone” in a single swoop by restoring the power of saving anyone at the last minute. Both arguments would have been strengthened by a film that alternated between them rather than using one as a cudgel to beat the other within an inch of its life. But “Black Flies” is too enraptured by the violence it finds in the margins of New York City to meaningfully interrogate the mental stress of healing it; too focused on the constant buzz of sirens and death to rescue anything more nuanced from those layers of white noise.“Black Flies” premiered in Competition at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.",

        "title": "‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ Review: Time Is of the Essence in a Sequel That Gets Old Fast",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Disney releases the film in theaters on Friday, June 30.It goes without saying that James Mangold is no Steven Spielberg, just as it would be wildly unfair to hold any Hollywood director to that standard. On the contrary, there’s something kind of admirable about the fact that Mangold found the chutzpah to close the book on the Bearded One’s signature franchise. What he didn’t find was a compelling reason to re-open that book in the first place.Not only is “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” an almost complete waste of time, it’s also a belabored reminder that some relics are better left where and when they belong. If only any previous entries in this series had taken great pains to point that out. Back to Mangold for a moment: It’s important to note that the failure of his latest movie has much less to do with his talents as a filmmaker than it does with the time at which he’s been asked to apply them. Mangold is as worthy an heir to Spielberg’s crown as anyone working at the studio level today, and the most electric setpieces in “The Dial of Destiny” — all of which are crammed into the opening 45 minutes — display the same charismatic flair and competence behind the camera that helped the vastly underrated likes of “Knight + Day” to punch so high above its weight class. No, the biggest (or at least most evident) difference between Spielberg and Mangold is that one of them would never have allowed himself to make anything this stale, and one of them probably wasn’t given any other choice. Of course, that’s partially Spielberg’s fault. Or yours. Arriving at a major inflection point in movie fan economics, “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” immediately became synonymous with the sacrilegious treatment of beloved Hollywood franchises. That 2008 fiasco made its fair share of Mutt Williams-sized mistakes, but the reflexive outcry over “nuking the fridge” overshadowed a deliriously well-directed thrill ride that dared to reconcile the contradictory impulses that had defined Indiana Jones from the start: family and adventure. In a clumsy preview of what “The Last Jedi” would do so masterfully a few years later, “Crystal Skull” had the courage to inflict meaningful change upon an iconic character, and the blowback was so intense that the most successful filmmaker in Hollywood history was too scared to ever pick up the fedora again. And why should he? That movie left its hero with the happiness that he’d never admitted he’d always wanted. “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” rips it away from him and gives him virtually nothing of value in return. An empty slog of a movie that only exists to smooth over any of the stray fan complaints that have splintered the franchise’s audience over the last 15 years, “The Dial of Destiny” is a globe-trotting adventure movie so safe that even its 80-year-old hero never seems to be in any significant danger (a more accurate “Star Wars” comp would be “The Force Awakens,” but that legacy sequel had the luxury of promising something new, whereas this one just devotes itself to untying perfect knots into loose ends).In hindsight, the worst part is that Mangold’s lengthy prologue dares to promise something more, as “The Dial of Destiny” starts with a de-aged Indy stealing a certain artifact from the Nazis at the tail end of World War II. The tech is still a little wonky here and there — appropriate for a franchise that privileges the finite powers of science over the vagaries of magic — but there’s no denying how much fun it is to watch a young Harrison Ford punch a brand-new array of Nazis, and even fight some of them on top of a speeding train alongside fellow archeologist Basil Shaw (Toby Jones). Mangold fills this entire sequence with delicious little gracenotes that help overcome some dark and dodgy CGI; a bit involving a very heavy bomb is worthy of any movie this franchise has ever produced.The artifact in question is Archimedes’ Dial, a mathematical tool believed capable of opening fissures in time. Nazi scientist Jürger Voller — a too-obvious Mads Mikkelsen, playing a Wernher von Braun type who’s easily the most boring villain Indy has ever had to face — certainly believes in the device’s power, and when the story picks up in 1969, he’s still desperate to find the missing piece that might allow the jumpstart to fulfill its mysterious purpose. Indy, meanwhile, has no such motivation. His marriage to Marion Ravenwood in shambles and his son out of the picture (feel free to breathe a sigh of relief), Indy is trudging towards retirement as a professor at Hunter College, and the “get off my lawn” vibes have never been stronger. Nor has his relevance ever been in greater doubt; his students used to blink love notes at him with their eyelids, and now they sleep through class. The good news is that there’s a perky, British-accented brunette in the back of the room who seems fully engaged with the material: Basil’s daughter, and Indy’s goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who brings a brilliantly rakish energy to the role, even if the script is never anywhere near as funny as she is). One minute they’re catching up over a few shots, and the next they’re speeding away from Voller’s coterie of forgettable henchmen (Boyd Holbrook, Shaunette Renée Wilson, some really really big guy whose name I don’t know) on a worldwide race for the ultimate McGuffin. It’s a race that will take the cast from Tangier to Sicily (among much stranger places) as the lopsided script labors to cross off all the necessary obligations. There’s a fantastic chase between a motorcycle and a horse, a random kid who adds even less to the plot than usual now that Indy is a father figure twice over, and a whole lot of Nazis being punched in the face. And dropped out of airplanes. And smashed into train tunnels. Some things never change, but at least this film’s easy nostalgia has some meta-textual purpose behind it, as “The Dial of Destiny” is deeply keyed into a simple idea that explains both its plot and its pitfalls: You can’t change the past, but you might be able to revisit it for a while. That means familiar beats and some fan-servicey cameos. It also means a paralyzing fear to make any choices that might retroactively change something about the franchise or challenge what its iconic hero means to people (it should go without saying that Ford is still Indy through and through, though the tearful speech he gave before the film’s Cannes premiere was far more emotive and moving than anything he’s asked to do in the film itself). Aside from a wild — and wildly inert — climax that might leave purists praying for the days of Irina Spalko and her disembodied alien heads, there’s nothing here that might surprise anyone. And that’s true in both macro and micro dimensions, to a degree that proves increasingly deadening every time Voller shows up at some location a few minutes after our heroes. “My god,” Indy gasps at one point. “We’re witnessing history.” But nobody involved in this movie ever dares to make any of their own.At the end of the day, “The Dial of Destiny” isn’t about adding new layers to Indy’s legend so much as it’s about polishing off the ones it already had. Like the relic at the center of this movie — which the self-interested Helena is constantly trying to sell to the highest bidder — the real issue here is about restoring the full value of a cinematic icon before he rides off into the sunset for good. You can feel how desperately Mangold, Ford — and even executive producers Spielberg and George Lucas, the latter of whom would no doubt smile at the silliness of the film’s grand finale — desperately want Indy to go out on top in the public imagination, and “The Dial of Destiny” needlessly unearths ancient history in order to make that happen.“Yesterday belongs to us,” someone says at one point, and when it comes to Indiana Jones, yesterday always will. The problem is that it already did, and today feels like a complete waste of time.“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Disney will release it in theaters on Friday, June 30.",

        "title": "Ethan Hawke Thought ‘Nobody Would Be Interested’ in the ‘Before’ Trilogy",
        "content": "Ethan Hawke thought the sun had set on the “Before” trilogy before it even hit theaters.In a discussion with Daveed Diggs for Interview magazine, Hawke admitted that he “didn’t even know” if audiences would care about his trilogy of “Before” films, which began in 1995 with “Before Sunrise.”“It’s not like I don’t want compliments and prizes and money and fire engines. I want everything, but I know how to listen to the river, how to listen to my own voice,” Hawke said. “I remember when I was doing those movies with Richard Linklater, for example, the ‘Before’ trilogy or ‘Boyhood,’ I didn’t even know if they would come out. One part of my brain thought, ‘Oh, people are going to love this.’ And another part of me thought, ‘Nobody’s going to be interested in this.’ I didn’t care. I knew that I was interested in it, and I can hear that voice.”Hawke added, “But every time in my life I try to sell out, when I’m like, ‘Oh, that’ll be a hit,’ every time I try to do that I fall on my ass. Totally wrong every time.”The beloved Richard Linklater film “Before Sunrise” later spurred sequels “Before Sunset” and “Before Midnight,” with a fourth film teased as part of an “After” series in 2020. The revolutionary years-long filmmaking tactic for “Boyhood” is set to be replicated for Linklater’s “Merrily We Roll Along” adaptation starring Paul Mescal and Beanie Feldstein.Hawke noted that, like Linklater, he follows other aspirational figures like Bob Dylan and Spike Lee when standing his ground.“I always feel like Bob Dylan’s being true to himself and millions of people happen to care,” Hawke said. “Spike Lee seems to always be working for himself and some of the movies hit big and some of them don’t, but you can tell they all kind of mean the same. It’s coming from the same creative force.”Hawke previously shared that Linklater assured him audiences would “care” about “Before Sunrise” as the human connection at the center of the largely-improvised film co-starring Julie Delpy grounded the story.“‘I don’t want you to worry too much about the script. I’m inviting you to be a filmmaker with me,'” Hawke recalled Linklater telling him. “‘My whole life I’ve gone to the movies and there’s espionage and shootouts and helicopters, all this action. Everything that I see is all this drama, [so much so] that you would think my life, our lives, have no drama. That’s not the way I feel. My life feels very exciting to me and I’ve never been involved in a chase or a gun shootout. My life is exciting to me. And what’s the most exciting thing that’s ever happened to me? Connecting with another human being…If we can put that on screen I think people will care.'”Hawke summed up in 2020, “Really what he is saying is that we are enough. It’s a hard thing for us, as people, to comprehend that. We are interesting. We are valuable. You are special from the moment you are born. At its essence, the movie is saying people witnessing each other has a huge power. Some times I leave ‘Harry Potter’ or ‘Avatar’ and I feel blue because I don’t have superpowers or magic. But I think Rick’s movies make you realize your life is magic.”",

        "title": "How Joel Kim Booster ‘Got Away with Murder’ Bringing ‘Fire Island’ to Life",
        "content": "Editor’s Note: This interview took place prior to the beginning of the Writers Guild of America strike on May 2.Welcome to It’s a Hit! In this series, IndieWire speaks to creators and showrunners behind a few of our favorite television programs about the moment they realized their show was breaking big.  As he geared up for the premiere of “Fire Island” on Hulu, writer and star Joel Kim Booster was braced for a deluge of #discourse.He was familiar with the critical audience feedback for well-intentioned queer media of yesteryear (like “Looking,” a show that Booster enjoyed at the but which has been sharply analyzed since it ended in 2015), and fully prepared for “Fire Island” to engender the same polarizing response.“Listen, I think I got away with murder a little bit in terms of the discourse around this movie,” Booster told IndieWire. “Gay men are especially critical of a media that depicts us because we are so starved for it. There’s not a lot of shows or movies that are about us, and so when we do get one, we sort of examine it very closely and try and find all the ways that it does and does not represent us and represent our specific experience.”While “Fire Island” did not wholly escape outlandish critiques (one note prompted Alison Bechdel to chime in and adjust her eponymous testing metric), the “Pride and Prejudice” adaptation centering gay Asian men received rave reviews. IndieWire’s Jude Dry called it “A guaranteed instant classic” that’s “gorgeously intersectional, subtly political, and a damn good time.” On May 13, the film won a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film (tied with “Anything’s Possible”), with Booster accepting the award for his screenwriting feature debut.“AI does not have the trauma, the joy, or the lived experience to create any of these stories that we are honoring tonight,” Booster said in his speech, underscoring his support for the Writers Guild of America strike. “AI certainly could not have written the line ‘If you take an edible with half of an Adderall it’s a bit like molly.’ You gotta live that life.”This interview has been edited for length and clarity.IndieWire: When you were developing and pitching Fire Island originally, what were some of the edits or feedback you got? People in Hollywood love to have opinions about why something doesn’t work, and a lot of the time they’re wrong — especially when it comes to a minority story.Joel Kim Booster: There [were a] lot of notes throughout the project, honestly, that asked me to explain a little bit more some of the jokes and some of the references throughout the movie. Specifically, I think I made a tactical error and including voiceover narration, because that gave the studio a lot of opportunity to tell me “Well just explain it in the narration” or “Explain this reference or this joke,” and I was really adamant about making sure that it didn’t feel like a movie that felt like it was for straight people.I think people are really sensitive to that when they watch movies about other people’s experiences. I know I feel that way when I watch shows like — “Insecure,” for example… I didn’t understand every reference in every joke, but I felt the authenticity through that and it was a more enjoyable watching experience because of it. I really wanted to replicate that kind of experience in my movie.Were there particular things that you remember maybe fighting for or a note you pushed back on?A lot of the drugs stuff was very much noted heavily. They definitely wanted to pull back on some of it and I lost some of those battles, and they also wanted more descriptions of what everything was and how it worked. The George W. Bush line [which Booster as Noah says out loud after thinking “Mission accomplished” in his voiceover] is a joke I’m convinced that only about 15 percent of the audience enjoyed or liked, and is one of my favorites because it is the experience for me of being on ketamine. The studio definitely didn’t quite understand it nearly as much and I’m not even sure it tested super well when we watched it with test audiences, but for me, that was an experience that I had that I wanted to mimic in the movie. I’ll be frank: there’s more narration in the movie than I originally planned on there being because of the need to compromise on the amount of explaining that needed to happen.I guess as a comedian you’ve dealt with this sometimes: Do you want everybody in the room laughing a little bit, or one person who just like snorts through their nose?Yeah, that’s my big thing. I’m much more interested in writing something specific — hyper specific, and the little left of center — that maybe hits fewer people than something super broad. There’s definitely broad comedy in the movie, there’s pratfalls, there’s all sorts of goofy shit that happens — but for me, it’s those little moments that sort of pass people by, that happen quite quickly that you have to be really keyed into the movie to really catch and grab and take hold of. Those are the moments that are way more rewarding to me as a writer and as a creator.I read that this was originally developed as a series for Quibi.When I wrote it as a series, quote, unquote, for Quibi, it was always written as a movie that just happened to be split up into 10 parts. When Quibi folded and Searchlight bought the script, I didn’t actually make that many changes to it from its Quibi version to the Searchlight version. I basically just took out the chapter breaks and smoothed out the structure a little bit, but by and large, the movie stayed pretty much the same from Quibi to Searchlight.I would have thought it would go the other way. So even in the Quibi stages, were you maybe wishing it were just a feature?Here’s the thing: Quibi was not my first choice of a home for this, but it was also the only place that was interested in a movie like this at the time. I was grateful that this company was interested in developing it with me, and the big draw with Quibi was [that] after two years, all the rights refer back to you — so I could get it back and recut it as a movie and sell it elsewhere. That was always sort of the goal.Was there a moment during production when you or maybe your director (Andrew Ahn), were kind of looking around and we’re like, “Damn, we have something special?“This was such a special [experience] for me because I got to do it with so many of my close friends and people who eventually became very close friends. We were a very tight knit group and so there were lots of moments, especially when we got to the island to actually shoot. We only shot on Fire Island for about the last two weeks of production, and those moments — I mean, like, dancing on the dock at the end of the movie, when we were able to shoot those scenes — it wasn’t acting. We were just really able to celebrate while we were doing [it] and… we were able to bring that energy to that scene. The first moment we were rehearsing the “Sometimes” karaoke scene, and Matt (Rogers) and Tomás (Matos) did not tell us that they had come up with choreography to do as as they were singing back up for Bowen (Yang), and so that was a complete surprise to us. I remember seeing it for the first time and just being like, “This is absurd and ridiculous and so funny — and if it works, then it will be one of the most iconic scenes in the movie.” And if it doesn’t, then the entire movie doesn’t work, because that’s the sort of vibe of the entire movie is this kind of level of ridiculousness mixed with earnestness. If we can pull this off then the movie will be success, otherwise we’re fucked.In April 2022, you tweeted that the discourse around “Fire Island” would kill you. Can you tell me more about that?I really wanted to make a movie that was about my experience without trying to represent everyone’s experience in the community. For me, the discourse was frustrating when it was discourse around “Well, this doesn’t represent me because XYZ,” when that was never really the goal.I tweeted that preemptively as sort of a joke. That did not happen to me or my movie, and the jury’s still out — maybe it will. Maybe in five years time people will revisit it and who knows how it will age. But I was really, really happy with the response from the gay community writ-large of my movie, and I was appreciative of it. In terms of knowing when it was a hit, a huge moment for me was going to Fire Island after the premiere. I was nervous; I was nervous to be in that environment with a bunch of gay men who loved Fire Island as much as I do — the place — and figuring out what their reaction to this movie would be. Going there — it was a little bit like being Mickey Mouse and at Disneyland for a week and having people feel comfortable enough to come up to me and tell me that they loved the movie, especially gay men who are notoriously not super effusive when it comes to other gay men’s work, I think. It really did feel like “Oh, wow, like we did it. We made something really great that people enjoy.”To paraphrase a famous musical: How do you measure a hit?That’s really tough. I’m not privy to the streaming numbers. Hulu does not share that information with me. I know that people watched it, I know that they’re very happy with the performance of it, so by those metrics I guess you could call it a hit. But for me, the hit aspect of it is still not something that I’ve completely come to terms. It’s really hard for me to even say — I would never say it to someone else, like “Oh, my movie was a hit.” I guess it’s moments like these are really the validation that comes with that. That’s a really tough question, and it’s not one that I feel qualified to answer.“Fire Island” is now streaming on Hulu.",

        "title": "Francis Ford Coppola Addresses Rumors of ‘Chaos’ on ‘Megalopolis’ Set: ‘The Source Was No Source’",
        "content": "Francis Ford Coppola is assuring audiences that “Megalopolis” was mega-fun to film, despite rumors of “chaos” on set.The Oscar winner revealed in an interview with Deadline alongside Kevin Costner that he can understand the parallel between rumors surrounding the notorious production of “Apocalypse Now” and now, almost a half-century later, “Megalopolis.” The epic film, which Coppola has described as a futuristic “love story,” has a staggering reported $120 million-plus price tag that Coppola financed himself.Production wrapped in March 2023 amid reports of creative unrest on the project, which stars Adam Driver, Shia LaBeouf, Forest Whitaker, Aubrey Plaza, Giancarlo Esposito, Laurence Fishburne, Jon Voight, Jason Schwartzman, and Dustin Hoffman.“Well, ‘Apocalypse Now’ was out there being edited for months and months and months. And because it had been made in the Philippines, it was sort of mysterious,” Coppola said. “[With ‘Megalopolis’] it was much the same thing. A rumor starts out; there was a report about chaos. But the source was no source.”Coppola continued, “From my point of view, I was on schedule, which, on a big, difficult movie, is hard to do. I love my actors, and there is not one of them I would change. The movie has a style that went beyond my expectations. That’s sincerely how I feel. The most important thing is the life the film might have when eventually it cuts together and blossoms.”He added, “On ‘Godfather II,’ that happened three weeks before a devastating preview. And ‘Peggy Sue Got Married’ had a terrible preview, then two weeks later, it came together. Movies can change their chemistry…But I am grateful to be in the position to be able to make a film that haunts me and that I feel will be wonderful, that will shed light on the subject of what the future might be like and what human beings are really like. I am as happy as I could be.”A report in January 2023 confirmed that visual effects production supervisor Mark Russell, production designer Beth Mickle, and supervising art director David Scott had left “Megalopolis,” with the VFX team parting ways in December 2022. A source told IndieWire that creative differences between Coppola and select crew members led to their respective departures.The film is about an architect who tries to rebuild New York as a utopia following an apocalyptic disaster.The creative team switch-up prompted a statement from the Art Directors Guild that it would be looking into the situation to “ensure proper staffing and scheduling.” New production designer Bradley Rubin of “The Mandalorian” and “A Star Is Born” fame was later brought on board.“Megalopolis” actor Adam Driver previously praised Coppola for being a “courageous” filmmaker who was “pushing” the film to be “as inventive as it could be.”“‘Megalopolis’ is one of the most exciting things that I’ve ever been a part of, with Francis [Ford Coppola] in particular,” Driver said. “It’s one of the best shooting experiences I’ve had. And the things that he’s made, there’s no frame of reference for it. It’s so unique and inventive and hopefully accessible by everyone. That it’s not so elusive that it’s for a certain audience, it’s for everyone. And he is everything that you hope he will be.”The “Marriage Story” actor formerly told IndieWire in a statement that while there were on-set departures from members of the creative team, production went smoothly despite conflicting reports.“All good here! Not sure what set you’re talking about! I don’t recognize that one! I’ve been on sets that were chaotic and this one is far from it,” Driver said. “The environment that’s being created by Francis, is one of focus and inspiration. As of now, we’re on schedule, making our days, and honestly, it’s been one of the best shooting experiences I’ve had. Our crew is fast and inventive, our costume department is on point, the actors are incredible and willing, and Francis is one of the most insightful and caring people to work with. I’m very proud to be making this movie with him, and them, and though I haven’t interviewed everyone, I can confidently say that that’s the general attitude on set.”",

        "title": "Visconti Icon Helmut Berger Dies: ‘The Damned’ and ‘Ludwig’ Actor Was 78",
        "content": "Helmut Berger, the Austrian actor and regular Luchino Visconti collaborator who become one of the most recognizable faces of European arthouse cinema in the 1960s, has died at the age of 78. The news was announced by the actor’s agent, who wrote that he died “peacefully but nevertheless unexpectedly” on his management company’s website.Born in Austria in 1944, Berger moved to Rome and began pursuing an acting career after expressing disinterest in following his parents into the hospitality industry. He initially found work as an extra before meeting Visconti in 1964. The “Rocco and His Brothers” director gave Berger a small part in his 1967 film “The Witches,” an omnibus film also directed by the likes of Vittorio De Sica and Pier Paolo Pasolini. Berger and Visconti began a professional and romantic relationship that would go on to shape the European cinema landscape of the subsequent decade.Berger’s most significant roles came in two of Visconti’s next projects: “The Damned” and “Ludwig.” In 1969’s “The Damned,” Berger played an unhinged fictional heir to a steel empire in Nazi Germany who was willing to bend his morals and do business with Hitler in order to fulfill his lusts for money and power (among other things). Three years later, “Ludwig” saw him portraying the infamous “swan king,” Ludwig II of Bavaria, in a film that explored the late monarch’s obsession with extravagance and the opulent lifestyle that eventually saw him declared insane. Both films saw him portraying powerful men with ambiguous sexualities, which helped establish Berger as one of his era’s most notable sex symbols.He re-teamed with Visconti on the 1974 film “Conversation Piece,” which starred Burt Lancaster as an aging professor who develops a close relationship with a younger man (Berger). Many interpreted the project as an allegory for the close relationship that Visconti and Berger developed over their decade of working together. It was Visconti’s penultimate film before his 1976 death and the final project that the two men would work together on.Berger continued to act until his retirement in 2019, memorably playing the titular role in Massimo Dallamano’s Oscar Wilde adaptation “Dorian Gray” and Frederick Keinszig in Francis Ford Coppola’s “The Godfather Part III.”",

        "title": "Roger Deakins Was ‘Frustrated’ Filming ‘Dinky’ Train for Iconic ‘Assassination of Jesse James’ Robbery Scene",
        "content": "Roger Deakins wasn’t onboard with how “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford” train sequence was turning out.The Oscar-winning cinematographer reflected on the iconic scene from the 2007 film starring Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck, namely calling out how “frustrated” he was over the “dinky” train used for historical purposes on set. The sequence in question involves Jesse James (Pitt) staging an elaborate robbery of a train during the first act of the Andrew Dominik film.“I’ve got to say, Andrew and I got kind of frustrated because we couldn’t really find a train line that we liked and we couldn’t find a period train to the scale that Andrew wanted,” Deakins said during a panel discussion at the 92nd Street Y. “We ended up shooting in Edmonton [in Alberta, Canada] on a museum line and luckily it goes through this little wooded area, but the train was really dinky. Andrew was absolutely frustrated at it.”Deakins admitted that the shot design for the film itself “evolved” after the storyboarding process once locations were being scouted.“A lot of things you do, you kind of make do with what you have,” Deakins said. “Part of the challenge was to make that train feel like a massive creature coming out of the darkness. The darkness hides a lot.”He added, “I would never say I was happy with it afterwards. I was always kind of unhappy with it because it wasn’t as big as we wanted.”The “1917” cinematographer noted that filmmaking is all about “compromise” and that sometimes he can’t even watch one of his films until “five years later” if it happens to be playing on TV.Yet for “The Assassination of Jesse James,” there was more than just the language of cinema that had to be translated between him and director Dominik.“You talk about somebody, a director, that’s so passionate and has something in his mind. To be quite honest, the hard thing with Andrew is trying to find what that was in his mind and do something in terms of what he was after,” Deakins said. “It’s so much about the poetry of the images and the sound.”Deakins previously campaigned for the extended cut of “Jesse James” to be released. Director Dominik confirmed in April 2022 that there is a “better version” of the film that is about 15 minutes longer than the theatrical cut.IndieWire recently named “The Assassination of Jesse James” the best cinematography of the 21st century, tied alongside cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki’s vision for Terence Malik film “The Tree of Life.” Both films star Brad Pitt. IndieWire’s Jim Hemphill wrote of “The Assassination of Jesse James” that Deakins commissioned custom-built lenses to illicit the feeling of portrait photographs from the era. “The combination of these lenses with Deakins’ elegant shooting through doorways, windows, and other frames within frames gives ‘Jesse James’ an involving sense of voyeurism,” Hemphill penned.",

        "title": "‘The Delinquents’ Review: Two Men Try to Steal Freedom in a Delightfully Existential Three-Hour Heist Movie",
        "content": "Arguably the first slow cinema heist movie, Rodrigo Moreno’s dreamy and discursive “The Delinquents” might kick off with one of the most low-key bank robberies anyone has ever attempted, but it’s hard to overstate how thrilling it feels once the thief finally tells us about what he stole. Morán (Daniel Eliás) is a middle-aged employee at a musty Buenos Aires bank that seems to have gotten stuck in the 1970s — a fitting touch for a workplace that functions as a repository for lost time. People start there when they’re young, only to wake up in the same place some 55 years later and realize that the job they performed to help pay for their life has actually become their life somewhere along the way. When the sun rises on Morán’s apartment in the morning, his colorless uniform is already laid out on the chair next to his bed as if it were his body, and he were merely its ghost. Maybe that explains why he’s all but invisible to his colleagues at the bank, who don’t pay Morán even the slightest bit of attention as he stacks a few dozen bricks of American cash out of the vault and into his backpack. Later that night, while having some fast food with his co-worker Román (Esteban Bigliardi), Morán will explain that he stole precisely $650,000, which is exactly twice as much money as he would earn before retirement if he worked every day for the next quarter of a century. He plans on turning himself in, but not before offering Román an even split of the money if his colleague agrees to hide the money for the duration of his prison stint.It’s just basic math: For the same payout, Morán could either spend three years in jail, or 25 years at the bank. He doesn’t want to be rich, he just wants to be free. Free from capitalism, free from its lopsided farce of a work-life balance, and free from the strictures of conventional thinking, which don’t just affect our schedules but also how we see the world itself. That might seem a foolish goal in a film less creatively unbound than the one Moreno has made here, but this playful three-hour reverie is so happily unmoored from the expectations of everyday storytelling that it’s tempting to think Morán might not be tilting at windmills after all.  Short by the standards of some recent Argentinian cinema, but still breezy and unhurried in a way that invites your mind to wander around without being leashed to the usual obligations of plot, “The Delinquents” is less interested in the details (or dramatic consequences) of Morán’s theft than it is in how the very idea behind it begins to remap Román’s entire worldview. The gym bag full of money that he stuffs into his bedroom closet doesn’t provoke his greed so much as his imagination. The cops never really cotton on to what happened, and neither of Moreno’s lead characters are made to feel like the walls are closing in on them. On the contrary, “The Delinquents” cleverly inverts the average heist movie by lifting the veil off its characters’ eyes and expanding their concept of what’s possible — gradually at first, and then with such delirious force that Morán and Ramón threaten to come unglued from reality. That their names are anagrams for each other reflects the film’s lightly cosmic interest in the mysteries of the universe; that it also sets up a laugh-out loud Marvel joke reflects the film’s warm-dry sense of humor. While “The Delinquents” was pointedly made to provoke active viewing and push back against the algorithmic storytelling that has choked the life out of modern cinema, its airiness and emergent sense of romance make it a delightful place to get lost for a while. When we’re first introduced to Morán, he’s determined to escape the rat race in which the first thing people ask each other is invariably some variation on “what do you do for work?,” as if that were the only meaningful way of assessing someone’s value. So much as “The Delinquents” can be strictly defined as a film about anything, it’s a film about the search for a better question. Answers are off the table here, all the way through the movie’s wide, wide, wide open ending, but that frame of reference expands a bit further with every passing scene. The thing is that work was never a particularly meaningful index for identity in the first place. Ramón had been an employee at the bank for years, spending more time with his colleagues than he does with his family, and yet he and his colleagues have developed almost zero loyalty to each other. Morán doesn’t pick him to be his accomplice because they’re friends, but simply because he was the most convenient choice (a decision owed to some funny business involving a neck brace). The fact that Ramón has to support the world’s thirstiest teenage son — you’ll see what I mean — doesn’t factor into it, just as the fact that Ramón looks kinda like Ben Mendelsohn and maintains a remarkably active sex life for a long-married man has nothing to do with his eventual decision to leave his worker-bee life behind. Ramón will come to leave the rest of the world behind with it, as the bank teller appears to slip into another plane of existence after Morán tasks him with burying some of the money in the Cordoba hills. It’s there, towards the end of a journey so long that it stretches from one part of Moreno’s film to another, that he falls in with a group of free spirits who reveal the true breadth of what this life has to offer. It’s a testament to the disarming effect of Moreno’s narrative rhythms — to the enchanted charm of his zooms, and the ability of Astor Piazzolla’s oboe symphonies to spirit you away along with them — that Ramón’s chance encounter with a few strangers by a watering hole has the same mind-altering power of Morpheus introducing Neo to the Matrix. It doesn’t hurt that one of the women he meets there takes a liking to him, nor that the day-long romance that develops between them is shot with the magic of a lifelong memory. The spark that Ramón feels around Norma (Margarita Molfino) lingers in his mind like an open flame, one that he struggles to extinguish once he returns to his marriage in Buenos Aires. It’s here, in the even more languid and abstract second half of Moreno’s film, that “The Delinquents” begins to dwell upon the true cost of freedom. It does so without a hint of moral panic or the threat of becoming a cautionary tale, as Moreno relies on ruminative split-screens and an elastic sense of time in order to take stock of what it means to embrace a life without backstops or boundaries. Morán and Ramón aren’t punished for their choices, per se, but there are consequences to blowing wherever the wind takes you, and it does require each of these men to surrender the control that had made them feel at home in their former lives, at least to one degree or another. As it goes with any good existential crisis, their newfound awareness of life’s meaninglessness will have to be its own reward. “Where is freedom?,” a song asks over the closing credits. Morán and Ramón are tasked with finding it for themselves, and Moreno isn’t willing to offer them any hints, even when the promise of freedom is all these characters have left. Their search is naturally one without any fixed destination, but watching them ride off into the sunset, the palpable sense of limitless possibility seems like victory enough. “Wasn’t film dead?,” someone asks the director who Ramón happens to meet on his trip around Cordoba. “Maybe it didn’t completely die,” they reply. “The Delinquents” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "content": "Adam McKay is unveiling his follow-up podcast to 2021’s “Death at the Wing,” this time focusing on 1950s Hollywood deaths.The Oscar nominee and his company Hyperobject Industries and Sony Music Entertainment will release “Death on the Lot” on June 1, centered on the deaths of James Dean, Hattie McDaniel, John Garfield, and more Hollywood figures. The eight-episode podcast is hosted by McKay and features interviews with Ron Howard, Lee Grant, James Cromwell, and even relatives of some of the episode subjects.“All during the making of ‘Death at the Wing,’ we kept saying the only other comparison we can think of is Hollywood after World War II,” McKay told Variety. “Then we thought, ‘Well, let’s do a season about that, and see what we can uncover.’ And if possible, it was even richer and deeper, and more to the core of the American story than we anticipated.”McKay continued, “You’re able to walk into the project, and make the project, with questions still unanswered. With these podcasts, the questions are the central theme of the show — and it’s really fun, because you’re constantly making discoveries. It’s just a very living and breathing process, all the way to the very end, when you record that last couple of sentences.”“Death on the Lot” is written by Brian Steele and Hadley Meares, Clare Slaughter, and Harry Nelson at Hyperobject, and edited by Jody Avirgan.McKay noted that interviews were key for the podcast episodes.“That diversity of voices, it’s essential to this kind of storytelling, because it’s incredibly interdisciplinary,” the “Don’t Look Up” director said. “You’re not ever just looking at things through an economic lens, a sociological lens, an entertainment history lens — the lens is always shifting. So it really creates this need for an incredibly broad perspective. That collection of voices is the center, the core, of the show. It’s the living questions — and then going to this incredible array of people to get those answers.”On the film front, McKay is gearing up for his “next big one” for Netflix, “Average Height, Average Build,” which stars Robert Pattinson, Amy Adams, Robert Downey Jr., Forest Whitaker, and Danielle Deadwyler. The political satire is confirmed to center on a serial killer who hires a lobbyist to change the laws around murder.",

        "title": "‘Youth (Spring) Review: Wang Bing Shows Working-Class China Through Austere Eyes",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Icarus Films releases the film at NYC’s Metrograph on Friday, November 10.The opening panel of an eventual triptych, “Youth (Spring)” feels jam-packed and incomplete. A formally austere direct-cinema tour through Middle Kingdom sweatshops, director Wang Bing’s immersive, 3.5-hour opus heralds a welcome return of the documentary genre to the Palme d’Or race, and a more than promising opening salvo to a final 10-hour film whose ultimate form remains tantalizingly unknown (presumably, “Summer” will follow). As a standalone feature, the dense and repetitive slice-of-life offers notes on a theme, lamenting stifled promise while considering the ways such youthful vigor can withstand, overcome or wholly be crushed by the grinding gears of capitalism with Chinese characteristics.         But for an open-ended coda, “Youth (Spring)” opens in a dingy alley in the industrial hub of Zhili City and stays there all the way through, devoting uninterrupted attention to the cramped and cruddy workshops that fill a street all too ironically called Happiness Road. After spending five years quietly observing the area’s various businesses, Wang demarcates each discrete space with supertitles that land like grim punchlines given the complete absence of appreciable difference. That monotony in interior design takes on more sinister implications given the workers’ ostensible “freedom” — nearly all of them economic migrants from the nearby Anhui province, the various youths flock to Happiness Road to work as free agents, “free” to change workshops at will, and are paid for items produced instead of a fixed wage.    Though bleak, this panel is not just a garden of earthly despairs. As in previous films, Wang’s impassive handheld camera waits for life to reveal itself, and for light to shine through the cracks in these concrete tombs. Like a Brueghel or a Bosch, “Youth (Spring)” is less an individual portrait than a bustling portrayal of types — lovesick fools and weary old souls, agitators and wallflowers, peacocks and young parents-to-be, all united and made equal by the same shared and endless labor and the same cramped living quarters. And all of them — but for two outliers — united by age.Moving between the workshop floors and dormitories (and, in one shot, following two young workers from one to the other, making clear their pinched proximity) and focusing almost exclusively on figures in their late teens and early twenties, “Youth (Spring)” feels like the world’s grimmest college movie. In a certain light, that’s exactly the case. The grungy sweatshops are, for so many of these workers, a first home away from home, the first taste of adult life. (“At school, we were never allowed to smoke,” says one delighted baby-face in between puffs. “Here, no one cares — so long as you can pay!”) Of course, with privacy at a premium, and free time bought with a sacrifice in economic productivity, the rows along Happiness Road are not the most opportune social hives, but then, the co-ed dorms are always full of singles, and life, as always, finds a way.  Constructed as a series of snapshots and vignettes, “Youth (Spring)” introduces pregnancies that cause joy and consternation, with Wang’s sole middle-aged subjects the parents of two workshop employees pushing for an abortion. If we never learn the denouement of that particular melodrama, we find its narrative stakes echoed in subsequent episodes, just as we do with the conversation about wages and collective bargaining. Though never polemical, Wang’s perspective is also not apolitical; the filmmaker just lets the squalor do the talking for him. Unlike the observational style of Frederick Wiseman, Wang has less interest in systems. The sundry youths that cross before his camera are not intersecting components in a larger mechanism, but overlapping ripples in a frigid body of water.Over an unhurried runtime, the film moves from workshop to workshop that all look the same, from worker to worker that all have their quirks, and from tonal registers that connect to one another in the aggregate. An hour-long sequence might toggle from flirtation to possibility to outrage to romance to weariness, with all these various shades of life scored by the constant whir of sewing machines and the sighs of human exertion.If that’s all “Youth (Spring)” had to offer, well, dayenu. Only Wang ever so subtly opens his aperture just past the three-hour mark by finally turning his camera on a workshop owner and before following the man home. We first see the owner as his employees do — in fact, we see him browbeating said employees (contractors, technically) into accepting a pay cut. Barely a decade older than those under his wing, the man points toward a way up in life, if not exactly a way off Happiness Road. With a family and economic strain of his own, Tian Weng also suggests a wider narrative scope and greater thematic ambitions, a point only furthered by a closing sequence that fully leaves Zhili City behind.Wang’s message is clear, and his promise of new seasons to explore and new panels to uncover ends with the kind of cliffhanger you don’t often see in austere arthouse documentaries. But it also leaves you with the stark realization that at, three-and-a-half hours, “Youth (Spring)” is only one-third of the picture.“Youth (Spring)” premiered in competition at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.",

        "title": "‘Fairyland’ to Open Frameline LGBTQ+ Film Festival with Appearance from Sofia Coppola",
        "content": "Frameline has announced the full program for the 47th annual San Francisco International LGBTQ+ Film Festival (Frameline47). Running June 14 through 24, with a streaming encore to follow from June 24 through July 2, Frameline47 returns with nearly 90 film screenings, including 12 world, 16 North American, and 9 U.S. premieres.Frameline will host 47 screenings at the historic Castro Theatre and other venues throughout the Bay Area. This announcement comes on the heels of Frameline’s recent unveiling of three marquee presentations: the Opening Night film, Andrew Durham’s Sundance favorite “Fairyland,” which will feature an in-person appearance from producer Sofia Coppola; the Oakland Centerpiece, Hannah Pearl Utt’s “Cora Bora,” featuring “Hacks” scene-stealer Megan Stalter; and the Pride Kickoff film, Jordan Danger’s “God Save the Queens,” featuring RuPaul drag icon Alaska, who will perform during the afterparty at Oasis.This year’s iteration is set to be Northern California’s largest film festival in 2023, according to Frameline.In terms of the lineup, Stephen Kijak’s documentary “Rock Hudson: All That Heaven Allowed“ looks toward the past, painting an intimate portrait of the Golden Age Hollywood icon, whose death from AIDS in 1985 forced a shift in the public perception of the epidemic. Meanwhile, D. Smith’s Sundance-winning documentary “Kokomo City” centers on four Black transgender sex workers and represents boundary-pushing efforts in cinema being led by Trans creatives. (One of the film’s subjects, Koko Da Doll, died earlier this year in a shooting in Atlanta.)In addition to examining queer and trans histories, Frameline47’s program spotlights the legacy and impact of LGBTQ+ cinema.“The pairing of ‘Chasing Amy,’ Kevin Smith’s 1997 cult classic, with Sav Rodgers’ directorial debut, ‘Chasing Chasing Amy,’ is a perfect encapsulation of not only this year’s festival, but of what it means to be a queer filmmaker,” says director of programming Allegra Madsen. “How do filmmakers — and all of us — deal with our problematic cultural past when it was both so formative and so damaging? For queer people, there isn’t always a roadmap to follow. We’re charting our own paths, and the Frameline47 films explore this, no matter the genre.”Other films include the queer teen sex comedy “Bottoms” from Emma Seligman (“Shiva Baby”) and starring Rachel Sennott and Ayo Edebiri; Sebastián Silva’s quasi-detective story and Sundance hit “Rotting in the Sun,” starring Jordan Firstman; Babatunde Apalowo’s award-winning “All the Colours of the World Are Between Black and White”; Zeno Graton’s “The Lost Boys”; “The Celluloid Closet” directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman’s “Taylor Mac’s A 24-Decade History of Popular Music”; and “It’s Only Life After All,” Alexandria Bombach’s acclaimed documentary about iconic queer folk duo the Indigo Girls.In addition to the Castro Theatre, Frameline47 venues include the Roxie (Frameline’s oldest venue partner), CinemaSF’s Balboa Theater, 4-Star Theater, and Vogue Theater — which will host festival tie-in screenings of classic queer films during Neighborhood Nights — and The New Parkway Theater in Oakland. The festival’s return to the East Bay boasts 10 Oakland screenings, including Frameline’s first-ever Oakland Opening Night and Centerpiece films.Frameline’s flagship festival runs June 14 through 24 in San Francisco and Oakland, and will be available virtually for audiences within the US.

        "title": "‘Le Retour’ Review: Great Performances Anchor Catherine Corsini’s Messy, Controversial Drama",
        "content": "Catherine Corsini‘s new film “Le Retour,” or “Homecoming,” opens with a moment of grief. A mother (Aïssatou Diallo Sagna) is nervously traveling with her two young daughters when she gets a phone call. Something terrible has happened and she begins to weep. Though that interaction hangs over the rest of the action, which then jumps ahead 15 years, we don’t find out exactly the circumstances of that pivotal call until well into the running time of this disjointed film. By the time we do, the impact of what has occurred is less traumatic than it is confusing, a product of thin characterization and messy storytelling. At the same time, Corsini has tapped incredible actors for this sun-drenched saga of familial bonds in Corsica, which is best when it’s relying on their dynamics and worst when it’s going for big revelations. The woman in those first frames is Khédidja, a nanny, who has been invited to the French island in the Mediterranean by a wealthy family to care for their young children on holiday. Her two daughters have come along for the summer: 18-year-old Jessica (Suzy Bemba), studious and distant, and 15-year-old Farah (Esther Gohourou), who, feeling underappreciated, thrives on chaos. The trip is fraught: The girls were born in Corsica, but have no memories of the place, aside from the knowledge that their father died there. Khédidja withholds information about their past, which Jessica and Farah resent. The family mystery plays out in tandem with the tale Corsini wants to craft of emotional and sexual discovery for the teens. Jessica falls for the carefree Gaia (Lomane de Dietrich), the older half-sister of the charges her mother is watching. Gaia, a rich girl with few worries, can be both loving and patronizing. Farah, meanwhile, develops a hostile flirtation with a boy on the beach (Harold Orsini), who she first meets when calling him out for his racist behavior towards a group of kids playing with a soccer ball.While there is joy to be found in the depiction of the spark of attraction and first love, the screenplay, co-written with Naïla Guiguet, stumbles in portraying the racial dynamics of these relationships — both Farah and Jessica are awfully forgiving of the microaggressions their romancers display.“Le Retour” arrives in competition after a raft of controversies that initially led to the film being scrapped from the lineup before it was returned about ten days later. The delay was specifically related to the fact that a sexual scene involving the then-15-year-old Gohourou and Orsini was not cleared with France’s Commission des Enfants du Spectacle, though there were also reports of alleged harassment on set by both Corsini and other crew members.In response, Corsini and her producer Élisabeth Perez said that there was an administrative error relating to the scene in question, and denied any harassment. “We want to emphasize that no complaint has been filed against Catherine Corsini, or against the film’s production,” they said in an open letter published by Variety. The scene in question featuring Gohourou, who also starred in the controversial “Cuties,” does not appear in the final product. It’s hard to imagine what purpose it would have served.Meanwhile, Gohourou, who has defended Corsini, delivers a standout performance here alongside Bemba, and the film thrives in the awkward spaces between sisters who could not be more different. Bemba plays Jessica with a wide-eyed reserve, while Gohourou is filled with hilarious fire making even the clunkiest dialogue work. When they are separated, each pursuing their own personal investigations, you can feel the energy of the material lag. That said, de Dietrich is often alluring and funny as Gaia, a smart-ass party girl who talks back to her condescending father Denis Podalydès, himself doing good work in blowhard mode.The actress who gets the short shrift is Diallo Sagna, the star of Corsini’s “The Divide.” The script deliberately obscures the source of some of Khédidja’s guilt and sorrow, but that unfortunately means the character remains elusive and Diallo Sagna has to play emotions that don’t make sense. Ultimately, Corsini seems less interested in what Khédidja is experiencing than what her daughters are, but that thin characterization has a ripple effect on the rest of the film. Corsini clearly has both affection and disdain for Corsica, which she paints as a place of beauty and rejection. Her camera relishes in capturing how the oppressive sun beams bouncing off the rustic structures and the crystalline qualities of the water against bare skin. Still, she recognizes an ugliness in this vacation town — the casual racism of the residents and the hedonism of the parties. There is juice in these contradictions, but Corsini struggles to tackle all of that and in turn give her protagonists fully rounded journeys. The result is a movie that registers as slight by its end, despite the talent found within its confines. What is nonetheless evident, however, is that Bemba and Gohourou are worth watching as they go forward in their careers. “Le Retour” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "title": "Michel Gondry Drove Everyone Insane and Then Made a Movie About It",
        "content": "Ten years ago, Michel Gondy was directing “Mood Indigo,” his freewheeling and fanciful adaptation of the 1947 French novel “L’Écume des Jours” starring Audrey Tatou. And then he got lost. “My brain was working in a different way,” he said over Zoom in a recent interview. “Each idea I had, no matter how important or small it was, became about life and death. Every little thing became super important. I felt like I was reaching ultimate creativity.” He now looks back on the whole experience as a result of his delusional state. The movie ran long and over budget, angering Gondry’s investors. He escaped to the French countryside with his post-production team to finish the project on his own terms. The movie ran over two hours and got mixed reviews; a shorter version was released in the U.S. by Drafthouse Films several months later.That saga provides the template for “The Book of Solutions,” which premieres at the Cannes market this week in search of U.S. distribution. A direct response to his “Mood Indigo” experience, Gondry’s first feature in seven years is a comparatively small-scale endeavor. The French production stars Pierre Niney as Gondry surrogate Marc, who steals his movie from a studio when executives try to take it away from him and brings his team to his secluded aunt’s house to finish it. With his ambition growing in several eccentric directions — an animated interlude, a car that doubles an editing bay — Marc frustrates everyone within his orbit, including his usually devout editor (Blanche Gardin). As a personal meta-movie, “The Book of Solutions” is a reminder of Gondry’s capricious storytelling proclivities and a sincere mea culpa for the toll they take on his collaborators. “I had this megalomaniac feeling of being a part of history,” Gondry said, recalling one tangent recreated in the movie in which his character abandons production to make a documentary about an ant. “It was difficult for everyone else because they could not understand why I was triggered by little things, but I could find universes inside them.” Gondry did in fact retreat to the aunt’s home in the rural Cevanne (subject of his 2009 documentary, “The Thorn in the Heart”), where she still lived in their childhood home, and he insisted on completing “Mood Indigo” on his own terms. The movie, which starred Romain Duris as a wealthy loner who falls for an ailing young woman played by Tatou, marked his first narrative feature after the misbegotten studio effort “The Green Hornet.” That compromised experience sent him hurtling into another extreme of unhindered creativity. “It’s something else to fail when you tried your own rather than to fail when it was not your own idea,” he said. “It’s much more painful. I wanted at least to do it my way.” Luc Bossi, who produced “Mood Indigo” and co-wrote it with Gondry, acknowledged that the filmmaker felt challenged by the production but not to the extremes depicted in the film. “Michel did go under stress because of the intensity of his feeling responsibility towards one of the most beloved books in French culture, and the level of scrutiny given to its release locally because of the book’s popularity,” he said.Bossi said he approved of Gondry’s desire to isolate himself during post-production. “At the time, I believe Michel also had in mind to create an artistic community there,” Bossi said. “They worked there for a while, and I suppose that’s the inspiration for the new film because it was certainly unusual and lively. Michel did create many things during this time, including posters for the marketing of the film and a small book with creation advice.” That tome became one of several narrative devices in his new movie, which finds Marc enmeshed in a series of outlandish creative indulgences, including one prolonged bit in which he coaches an entire symphony to improvise the score by following his ballet-like movements. During the “Mood Indigo” post-production, Gondry did that as well. “It gave me the sensation of driving a Formula 1 car, this feeling of creating something from nothing in a completely different way,” he said. “It was a sensation I’d never had before.”Marc’s energetic approach to resolving his movie leads him to create the titular guide to his project, a meticulous assemblage of drawings and charts that befuddle everyone else. As he demands participation in his whimsical plan, he’s forced to apologize more than once (and, in one case, apologize for his bad apology). That really happened, too. “The problem is that, after a while, you feel that your apologies have no meaning,” he said. “I talked to my editor from that time. I asked her what her main feeling was towards me, and she said she was worried even though we had the most intense arguments. They were good people and they cared about me beyond what was happening at the moment.”Gondry has explored the complexities of DIY filmmaking endeavors before with 2008’s “Be Kind Rewind,” but “Book of Solutions” operates on a much smaller scale. Between “Indigo” and “Solutions,” Gondry was the main director on Showtime’s Jim Carrey comedy “Kidding” before it was canceled after two seasons. Gondy said he was gratified by the opportunity to reunite with his “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” star (“he doesn’t need the traditional bullshit you sometimes go through with actors”), but his first serious TV undertaking left him uncertain about the medium. “The main problem with the series is the writer who’s also the showrunner,” Gondry said. “Sometimes, I was frustrated because the showrunner would ask me to make sure every single sentence is shot.” Since his “Eternal Sunshine” days, Gondry has taken a more organic approach by shooting all his actors simultaneously and allowing them to improvise in between scripted lines. “The actors don’t know if you’re shooting them or the other person, so they have no choice, they have to be all the way into their character,” he said. “I had a lot of material I developed and I couldn’t necessarily use it all. That’s why I thought I was better doing films.”Gondry is currently developing a musical based on the life and music of Pharrell Williams, though he said it could end up delayed by the writers strike. “It’s a pretty big budget, but it’s still something personal,” he said. While he’s made last few features in France, Gondry has a complicated relationship with the country. He agreed to participate as a member of the Oscar submission committee for France last year and found the experience unsatisfying. “I did it because I didn’t want to upset anyone, but it’s not my thing,” he said. The committee selected Alice Diop’s courtroom drama “Saint Omer,” but Gondry said his own preference was the suburban youth drama “The Worst Ones” and he found himself alone on that front.“It felt like they were choosing films that could win and not because they were the best films,” he said. “I think that’s a mistake. You have to pick the ones you love. They picked the one they picked because they said it checks all the boxes.” (“Saint Omer” was shortlisted, but ultimately did not land an Oscar nomination.) Gondry is more committed to creating a support system for newer filmmakers. Ahead of his Cannes premiere, he spoke to me from Dusseldorf, where his production company was participating in a traveling program for emerging directors to write short films with pre-made sets. He said he was happy to create an environment for newcomers, but reticent to offer much feedback.“The business is not great now, but young directors have a tendency to be quite picky and envision their future too far ahead,” he said. “I encourage as much as I can, I try to be positive, but I have to be very careful. Sometimes people can be really offended.”",

        "title": "Beyond Johnny Depp: Inside the First 48 Hours of a Frenzied Cannes Film Festival",
        "content": "This year’s Cannes Film Festival started with scandal, as Johnny Depp walked the red carpet for opening night selection “Jeanne du Barry” even as he remains persona non grata in the U.S.As Anne Thompson reported earlier this week:Clearly, Maïwenn cast Depp in a supporting character role. But the pony-tailed star turned up on time for the Cannes red carpet, signed autographs for excited fans, spoke French to interviewers, and posed for an eager phalanx of photographers. Reviews so far are solid if unexceptional. (Our critic described it as “perfectly serviceable,” with Depp as a minor note who “affords the French production an additional bit of luster.”) … In America, Depp inspires different feelings. At Tuesday’s Competition Jury press conference, jury member Brie Larson may as well have been speaking for Hollywood when she was asked about Depp in “Jeanne du Barry.” “We’ll see if I see it,” she said. “And I don’t know how I’ll feel about it if I do.”While Depp continued to hog the spotlight the next day thanks to a baffling press conference appearance, the festival itself kept rolling along. Several competition titles screened within the first 48 hours, including the French drama “Homecoming” from Catherine Corsini and the latest broken family saga from Japan’s Hirokazu Kore-eda, “Monster.” Meanwhile, buzz about the potential Palme d’Or frontrunners has already started for several films yet to screen, from Jonathan Glazer’s “The Zone of Interest” to Justine Triet’s “Anatomy of a Fall.”In this week’s episode of Screen Talk, Eric Kohn and Anne Thompson talk through several of these updates and what to expect in the days ahead.Screen Talk listeners attending Cannes are invited to attend a special live episode of Screen Talk recorded at the American Pavilion this Tuesday, May 23 at 2:30 p.m. Note: You must have an American Pavilion credential to access this event.

        "title": "Christopher Abbott and Margaret Qualley’s ‘Sanctuary’ Chemistry Was Years in the Making",
        "content": "“Dominatrix rom-com” doesn’t sound like the most obvious (or light!) sub-genre, but for “Sanctuary” stars Margaret Qualley and Christopher Abbott, the critically acclaimed romance marks one of the most fun projects to date in their respective careers. Even better: Qualley, after stealing scenes in Oscar-winning “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” and Abbott, whose breakout performance in “Girls” made him an immediate indie darling, have been trying to work together for years.“I was so excited to work with Margaret, finally,” Abbott told IndieWire during a recent interview. “There were a few jobs we had almost done together, but I’m glad this is the one that we got to do, because we had so much to do together.”“Sanctuary” stars Abbott as hotel heir Hal, who tries to end his psychosexual relationship with dominatrix Rebecca (Qualley) after inheriting his late father’s empire. However, Rebecca has other ideas about getting a piece of what she’s truly owed for fluffing Hal’s confidence, in more ways than one. Best described as a modern reimagining of “Pretty Woman,” “Sanctuary” is directed by Zachary Wigon (“The Heart Machine”) from a script by “Homecoming” co-creator and playwright Micah Bloomberg.“I do like the idea of it being some kind of odd take on a rom-com,” Qualley told IndieWire. “I interpret the movie as being kind of silly and fun and ultimately a love story.”Co-star Abbott agreed, adding, “I think it very much is in the rom-com territory, just a slightly different take on it, as opposed to like a thriller or a drama with elements of rom-coms. I think it lives more in a rom-com territory with elements of other genres sprinkled in.”Qualley credited director Wigon and Bloomberg’s precise visions for the tightly wound film that has more twists and turns than audiences will ever expect.“Pretty much nothing was improvised. The script very much reads like a play,” she said. “Both of us, for our preparation, just learned the thing front to back so we could just have fun on the day. Also, because we were shooting the whole thing in 18 days with a one-day weekend, we wanted to make the thing as easy as possible while we were actually shooting it. Zach completely shot-listed the entire thing beforehand, so it wasn’t shot like typical things are shot. We didn’t have coverage. We didn’t have close, medium, wide, this angle, that angle. Everything we shot was basically the edit. We would come in and do three to five, six takes of every set up but that set up was the entire scene. It was all pre-blocked and it was just written very precisely.”The “Fosse/Verdon” actress continued, “It was like a very stable job, actually, which was comforting in a sense. It’s very rare to have the same call time and wrap time every day for an entire movie.”Qualley gushed over co-star Abbott’s dedication to the role of Hal, arguably the straight man to Qualley’s unhinged Rebecca.“I feel like Chris did all the work for me,” the Emmy nominee said. “He’s really one of the best actors today. My job was so easy, because basically all I had to do was watch him and listen to him and I learned my lines really well and I would just say them according to how he said his last one. He’s just so fabulous and it made the whole thing really enjoyable for me because I never knew what he was going to do, and I think that weaves into not knowing exactly where the relationships stand as far as being fantastical or grounded in reality.”Abbott shrugged off the compliment, crediting both Qualley and screenwriter Bloomberg in turn.“I think that for Margaret and I, I just think the dynamics and what happens is written,” he said. “For me and Margaret, our job was about being open with each other and just playing and just trying different things and experimenting and then just giving Zach options.”Abbott added that “Sanctuary” came on the heels of the pandemic and unlocked another chapter in his own career.“At that point, I hadn’t worked in a little while and there was something really nice about showing up [to set],” Abbott said. “The movie is obviously in one location and it was a built set. Nothing was being determined by light outside. It was just sort of a marathon. We shot it in a short amount of time but we would show up at the same time every morning, be done the same time every evening.”Amid the ongoing Writers Guild of America strike, the pair’s emphasis on the importance of screenplays is being cast in a new light. For “Sanctuary,” the intricacies within Hal’s own scripts he pens for employee-slash-lover Rebecca offers a now-meta take on the relationship between screenwriters and actors.“This is a wildly collaborative art form compared to other art forms. There’s no movie without a script, without something to shoot,” Abbott said. “We rely on many different people to do their jobs. Micah Bloomberg, who wrote this script, is a great writer, a great playwright. I think he injected some of his playwriting abilities into this film script, and that was our map completely of what to do. I think the comraderie between actors and writers is very important and real.”Qualley added, “Completely. Nothing but absolute support. My job isn’t possible without writers. I very much depend on them.”Qualley and Abbott’s onscreen camaraderie is set to continue, thanks to Yorgos Lanthimos’ upcoming “Poor Things.” The female Frankenstein-esque horror film also stars Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Ramy Youssef, with both Abbott and Qualley appearing.“We didn’t really have much to do, or really anything to do together in ‘Poor Things,'” Abbott said. “We were in Budapest at the same time.” Qualley added, “‘Poor Things,’ I’m like in for two seconds. I haven’t seen it, but I’m excited to see everything Chris does in that movie. We haven’t actually gotten to work together since then.”And the duo are more than ready for another follow-up feature to deepen their own creative partnership. “I want more,” Qualley said. “I’m constantly looking for something for us to do together, because it was one of the most fun experiences for me. I just think he is the best. If you want to pitch a movie for us to do together, that’s a really good idea.”Neon will release “Sanctuary” in theaters on Friday, May 19.",

        "title": "No Prep, No Second-Guessing: ‘Fast X’ Director Louis Leterrier Jumped Straight Into the Fast Lane",
        "content": "When “The Fast and the Furious” regular Justin Lin stepped out of the director’s chair on “Fast X” just days into production, action veteran Louis Leterrier (“The Transporter,” “Clash of the Titans”) was given the keys to one of Hollywood’s biggest and most beloved franchises. On the one hand, it was a call he had been waiting for, as he had been a fan of the series ever since he and Jason Statham saw the original “Fast and the Furious” while shooting “The Transporter.” On the other, he was stepping into the most massive production of his career with no prep time to oversee another director’s crew. “Normally, being a film director is like being a conductor in charge of a 100-piece orchestra,” Leterrier told IndieWire’s Filmmaker Toolkit podcast. “This was like doing it with Metallica next to me playing at the same time, and Daft Punk playing nearby, and everybody had to play together and make it seem organic.”For Leterrier, the concern was delivering the satisfactions audiences expect from the franchise without leaving his own voice behind. “I didn’t want to break the stuff that was working,” he said. “I just wanted to take the opportunities I saw to enhance a couple of things here and there and put a new spin on them, while also bringing my own original ideas and everything the actors gave me.” Luckily, Leterrier found that Lin’s crew was more than open to trying new things. “I walked into the Rolls Royce of film crews,” he said, adding that he knew the cooperation of this crew would be essential toward realizing his vision for “Fast X.” “I’m not a sculptor or a painter, I’m a director. So I surround myself with a crew and a cast and a post-production team and a studio. And if all of us are making the same movie, it’s a smooth process.”Although Leterrier initially feared that a new crew and limited prep would be a challenge, he realized that there were unexpected advantages. Given the speed with which he had to work, “I was not second-guessing my instincts,” he said. It helped that Leterrier felt he had the complete trust of not only the cast and crew but the studio. “The studio gave me complete freedom. I never felt that ever in my career. When you do these giant movies, there’s always somebody breathing down your neck — ‘It’s too expensive, you’re not fast enough, are you sure about this shot?’ This time there was none of that.” According to Leterrier, the trick to gaining collaborators’ trust is simple: “You gain people’s trust by listening to them. When people feel really heard, and what you say back to them is not just a monologue about what you think, a relationship is forged.”Leterrier had to quickly forge that kind of relationship with every member of the film’s massive cast, from series regulars like Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez to newcomers Brie Larson and Jason Momoa. Even with Statham, who saw the original “Fast” with Leterrier over 20 years ago, a new kind of partnership had to evolve. “Jason Statham in ‘The Transporter’ is different from Jason Statham in ‘Fast X,'” Letterier said. “So even when I know the actors, this is different. You have different conversations with people on different movies, and you can’t just come in with your own thing and say, ‘OK, now it’s me and off we go.’ You have to ask, ‘What was your experience [on the other movies]? What do you want from this one?’ And I had to do all that with no prep or rehearsal.”Ultimately, Leterrier found that everyone was game and enthusiastic, and hopes that the pleasure everyone took in their jobs on set is evident on screen. “We all pitched in and had a blast, and I think you can see when everyone making a movie had a blast shooting it,” he said. “It’s big in scope, but the emotions are real, and I’m so, so proud and so happy.”",

        "title": "‘Theater Camp’ Trailer: Molly Gordon Directs Ben Platt in Ode to Musical Theater Summer Camps",
        "content": "There’s nothing that sings summer like (theater) camp.Molly Gordon‘s directorial debut “Theater Camp,” which she co-helmed with Nick Lieberman, draws upon the beloved chaos of theater camp days lore. The film debuted at 2023 Sundance and boasts an impressive ensemble cast including Amy Sedaris and “The Bear” breakout Ayo Edebiri, with Tony winner Ben Platt co-writing the script and starring in a lead role opposite Gordon.The official synopsis for “Theater Camp” reads: Tony Award winner Ben Platt and Molly Gordon star in the original comedy as Amos and Rebecca-Diane, lifelong best friends and drama instructors at a rundown camp in upstate New York. When clueless tech-bro Troy (Jimmy Tatro) arrives to run the property (into the ground), Amos, Rebecca-Diane, and production manager Glenn (Noah Galvin) band together with the staff and students, staging a masterpiece to keep their beloved summer camp afloat.Noah Galvin, Patti Harrison, Nathan Lee Graham, Owen Thiele, Alan Kim, Alexander Bello, Bailee Bonick, Kyndra Sanchez, Donovan Colan, Vivienne Sachs, Quinn Titcomb, and Caroline Aaron also star.Producers include Gordon, Platt, Lieberman, Will Ferrell, Erik Feig, Samie Kim Falvey, Julia Hammer, Ryan Heller, Maria Zuckerman, and Jessica Elbaum.IndieWire’s Kate Erbland called the film “a crowdpleaser for the misfit in all of us,” with the cast echoing the autobiographical sentimentality of the comedy.“This is definitely a love letter to that sort of experience, and the intensity of those three weeks in the summer where nothing matters except for who are your friends and what is that world and that time, and maybe the adults who wanna stay in that world, forever,” director and co-writer Lieberman told IndieWire during the Sundance Studio. “And it is a love letter, but there’s also you know, especially in the world of the theater, we have some jokes to be made about the way that the theater world operates.”Co-writer/director Gordon added, “We dedicated the movie to all of our drama teachers, even though we’re making fun of them, because when they’re telling you to do crazy things, it is this first moment of feeling seen. I was never that good in school, and when I was in my acting classes, anything was possible and there was no wrong answer. That first moment where you can really own your intelligence, even if they’re asking you to crawl as a lion or whatever.”“Theater Camp” premieres July 14 in theaters from Searchlight.

        "content": "The star-studded “Killers of the Flower Moon” is finally rising onscreen.Leonardo DiCaprio leads Martin Scorsese‘s latest film, and the auteur’s self-proclaimed first Western, in the Apple Original film. “Killers of the Flower Moon” stars DiCaprio as Ernest Burkhart, who allegedly murdered his wife Mollie’s (Lily Gladstone) Osage Nation family members in order to inherit their access to oil. Jesse Plemons plays an FBI agent in the early stages of the law enforcement agency.Robert De Niro, Brendan Fraser, Tantoo Cardinal, Cara Jade Myers, JaNae Collins, and Jillian Dion also star in the ensemble film, which debuted at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.The official synopsis reads: At the turn of the 20th century, oil brought a fortune to the Osage Nation, who became some of the richest people in the world overnight. The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder. Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Gladstone), “Killers of the Flower Moon” is an epic western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal.The film is based on David Grann’s non-fiction book about the series of murders in Osage County, Oklahoma during the 1920s after oil was discovered on Osage Nation Indigenous land. The newly-formed FBI investigated the cases at the time.Eric Roth and Scorsese adapted the book for the screenplay. Writer-director Scorsese also produces alongside Dan Friedkin, Bradley Thomas, and Daniel Lupi. DiCaprio executive produces along with Rick Yorn, Adam Sommer, Marianne Bower, Lisa Frechette, John Atwood, Shea Kammer, and Niels Juul. Hailing from Apple Studios, the film is produced alongside Imperative Entertainment, Sikelia Productions, and Appian Way. “Killers of the Flower Moon” marks DiCaprio and De Niro’s first feature film together with longtime collaborator Scorsese.“I found that, because of the subject matter in many of the films, there seemed to be a comfort level [with Bob and I], not easy by the way at all, but a comfort level in knowing we could get to a place,” Scorsese said working with De Niro. “‘Casino; really solidified it for me. That was the ultimate, in terms of that type of picture for him and me.”“Killers of the Flower Moon” premieres in limited release on Friday, October 6 and will open wide on Friday, October 20 via Paramount Pictures before streaming globally on Apple TV+.

        "title": "‘Nimona’ Teaser: Riz Ahmed and Chloë Grace Moretz Lead Netflix’s Long-Awaited Queer Animated Film",
        "content": "Chloë Grace Moretz and Riz Ahmed are finally debuting their respective graphic novel counterparts in Netflix‘s “Nimona.”The long-awaited big screen adaptation of ND Stevenson’s bestselling queer 2015 graphic novel finally comes to Netflix this summer. “Nimona” was previously scrapped by Walt Disney Co. after the company allegedly took issue with the now-defunct Blue Sky Studios’ inclusion of a same-sex kiss. Blue Sky Studios executives claimed that “Nimona” was “75 percent” completed before Disney allegedly had “pushback” on the LGBTQ+ themes central to the story.Netflix acquired the film in April 2022 and partnered with Annapurna Pictures to bring it to the streamer. “Nimona” started production again early last year with DNEG Animation.Per the official synopsis of the new Netflix film, when Ballister Boldheart (Ahmed), a knight in a futuristic medieval world, is framed for a crime he didn’t commit, the only one who can help him prove his innocence is Nimona (Moretz), a mischievous teen with a taste for mayhem — who also happens to be a shapeshifting creature Ballister has been trained to destroy. But with the entire kingdom out to get him, Nimona’s the best (or technically the only) sidekick Ballister can hope for. And as the lines between heroes, villains, and monsters start to blur, the two of them set out to wreak serious havoc — for Ballister to clear his name once and for all, and for Nimona to…just wreak serious havoc.   Eugene Lee Yang, Frances Conroy, Lorraine Toussaint, Beck Bennett, Indya Moore, RuPaul Charles, Julio Torres, and Sarah Sherman round out the cast.Nick Bruno and Troy Quane co-directed the animated feature from a script by Robert L. Baird and Lloyd Taylor. Karen Ryan, Julie Zackary, and Roy Lee serve as producers, with Megan Ellison, Robert L. Baird, Andrew Millstein, and John Powers Middleton as executive producers. Author Stevenson is a co-producer.Author Stevenson celebrated Netflix distributing the film, tweeting, “‘Nimona’’s always been a spunky little story that just wouldn’t stop. She’s a fighter…but she’s also got some really awesome people fighting for her. I am excited out of my mind to announce that THE NIMONA MOVIE IS ALIVE…coming at you in 2023 from Annapurna and Netflix.”“Nimona” premieres this summer on Netflix. Check out the teaser below.",

        "title": "‘White Men Can’t Jump’ Review: This Contemporary Remake Shoots (and Doesn’t Score)",
        "content": "When Grammy-winning music video director Calmatic (born Charles Kidd II) made the jump to moviemaking, the music-loving Los Angeles native opted for familiar if smart territory: an updated remake of beloved 1990 teen classic “House Party.” The result was a Warner Bros. release that, though originally slated for HBO Max only, charmed enough studio brass to earn a theatrical release in January. It was a fitting first film for those new to the Calmatic universe, riffing on a dated hit with a contemporary sensibility, updated music cues (and even some classics), super-fun set pieces, and talented young actors.For his second film, released less than four months later, Calmatic sticks with that already familiar formula. This time around, it’s an updated remake of a beloved 1992 sports comedy classic, “White Men Can’t Jump,” which again offers (and, yes, this is just a copy-paste from above) a contemporary sensibility, updated music cues (and even some classics), super-fun set pieces, and talented young actors. And, just like “House Party,” as fresh as certain elements of Calmatic’s latest are, there’s a distinct lack of energy and cohesion on the screen. In an industry gone mad with remakes, sequels, and requels, the budding filmmaker’s ability to put a new spin on old movies is welcome, but it’s certainly no slam dunk.Much like his “House Party,” Calmatic doesn’t go for a straight, play-by-play remake here (an invigorating choice), instead opting to take the bare bones of Ron Shelton’s Woody Harrelson- and Wesley Snipes-starring hit comedy and refashioning it for contemporary times. The script, written by Kenya Barris and Paul Hall, still keeps the rough outlines of the Shelton film and its central characters — rapper Jack Harlow (in his first leading role) is the underestimated white dude, while Sinqua Walls (“Nanny,” “The 15:17 to Paris”) is his much more obviously talented and Black soon-to-be partner. Both are LA-based comedies where street hustling and 2-on-2 hoops tournaments can lead to fame and fortune (or at least a well-deserved paycheck).But that’s about as much material as the films share, as Barris and Hall’s bloated script spends far too much time building in off-the-court motivations to explain why (and how) these two seemingly mismatched ballers end up hustling games together. In short: they need money. We get it! We’ve all been there! Instead of accepting that at face value, Calmatic’s film is overly interested in digging into what makes these guys tick, even though they’re also both clearly drawn types.Kamal (Walls) is a former high school hotshot, and the film even opens with a young Mal and his dad (the late Lance Reddick) on TV talking about his skills, training, and big plans. Mal’s dad is his rock and biggest supporter — Reddick’s Benji initially scans as something of a LaVar Ball stand-in, but there’s much more going on here — and their fraught relationship and the impact it had on young Mal’s budding career is his driving force throughout the film. (Need more reminders of that? The film supplies an endless parade of quick, constant flashbacks to help keep their father-son story top of mind.)Kamal is “washed” by the time Jeremy (Harlow) arrives at his local gym during a pickup game. Jeremy is beyond crunchy — here’s a dude who shows up toting homemade juice cleanses, sporting a “Self Care Club” hoodie, and banging on about the power of meditation — but he’s also got his own demons, namely a pair of busted ACLs and a barely concealed pain pill problem. For both Kamal and Jeremy, basketball is the driving force of their lives, even if it’s also complicated nearly everything else they’ve got going on (like fracturing romantic relationships; “A Thousand and One” breakout star Teyana Taylor gets a small role as Mal’s wife Imani, and she absolutely shines).They’re far more fun characters — and Harlow and Walls are far more interesting actors — when they finally team up to hustle local games in order to shore up their partnership and raise enough cash to enter a local 2-on-2 tournament that boasts a massive purse. While Calamatic’s film takes its own road there, the same predictable beats from Shelton’s original are firmly in place. Same story, different path. (This, funnily enough, is not its own knock on the film or the genre it’s part of, the sports comedy with a heart of gold can, and should be, some of the most rousing popular entertainment Hollywood can offer.)But this isn’t particularly rousing. More frustrating is that the pieces are there: Calmatic’s flair (only really hitting its stride in the film’s final act, when the basketball action really ramps up), Harlow and Walls’ unexpected chemistry, and a story that genuinely seems interested in the well-being of its characters. It’s funny in fits and starts (Kamal’s wacky cousins, played by Vince Staples and Myles Bullock, are consistently amusing), clever enough about the way we talk about race among friends, and comforting in its predictability. But that overwrought, overwritten script and leaden pacing throughout its first two acts weighs everything down. This thing should be light on its feet, fleet and fast and fun. Instead, it drags down the court, taking plenty of shots, but never quite sinking any of them.“White Men Can’t Jump” starts streaming on Hulu on Friday, May 19.",

        "title": "‘The Sweet East’ Review: Sean Price Williams’ Directorial Debut Stars Talia Ryder as a Teen in Five Cults",
        "content": "A post-ironic picaresque born from a take-no-prisoners attitude so oppressive that it soon becomes its own kind of jail, Sean Price Williams’ “The Sweet East” amounts to something more than just a series of semi-connected trolls. But this sniveling little satire of modern American thought is never funnier or more sure of itself than when it makes you feel like an asshole for taking it too seriously. Consider the film’s opening few minutes, which appear to tee up a lo-fi but legibly familiar sex comedy set on a high school trip to Washington, D.C., until things, uh, take a turn. We first meet Lillian (“Never Rarely Sometimes Always” breakout Talia Ryder, perfectly nonplussed) as she lies in a hotel bed next to a blond mouth-breather who plays with his used condom like it’s a party balloon and brags about how he’s going to be a star. Later, after reuniting with the rest of her grade, Lillian and her classmates run amok down the hallway, fuck around on the bus, and pose in front of the Capitol Building for a shot that ignores the architecture of American democracy to instead lavish attention on their asses instead. Williams is an acclaimed cinematographer whose free-range, scuzz-core aesthetic has become synonymous with several of the most bitter and/or feral independent films of the last 15 years (e.g., “Frownland,” “Heaven Knows What,” anything directed by “The Sweet East” producer Alex Ross Perry), but if you didn’t know any better, you could almost be fooled into thinking that his directorial debut might owe more to Richard Linklater than the Safdie brothers. But then, as the opening credits roll over Lillian singing a lovely Paul Grimstad original to her own reflection in the bathroom mirror of a D.C. bar and restaurant, well… there’s really no other way to put this: Pizzagate happens. More specifically, a gun-toting conspiracy theorist played by MTV-era icon Andy Milonakis storms in and demands to be shown the pedophile ring that’s being run out of the basement. In real life, it’s the stuff of modern American myth, but in the bizarro world of “The Sweet East,” every liberal punchline is taken at face value, and every morsel of progressive logic is treated like a joke. Not only is there actually a pedophile ring underneath the restaurant, but the glitter-punk freegan activist who helps Lillian flee the scene observes that it “seemed so much bigger when I was a kid.” Having forgotten her iPhone in the bathroom, our heroine leaves her life behind along with it, surrendering herself to the pre-digital rhythms of a road comedy in which each sequence and subculture is almost completely disconnected from the others, but all are equally embarrassing. The Eastern seaboard is the only thing this shit-eating movie allows itself to love unironically, and Lillian bounces around it like a wayward Lolita or the disaffected angel of death. Allusions abound, but “EO” feels like a particularly apt — if entirely accidental — point of reference for this film’s episodic structure; just imagine if the donkey were the only character who wasn’t destined for the slaughterhouse. Textured with Williams’ usual grain and kept alive by his keen eye for detail, “The Sweet East” essentially sees America as a series of concentric cults. Lillian is like a teenage Virgil leading us on a tour through some kind of stupid new hell where anyone who believes in anything does so with an all-defining religiosity that demands to be mocked. What little generosity of spirit the film has to spare is saved for its most odious characters, like the crypto-fascist college professor played by Simon Rex (incredible, hilarious). He invites Lillian to stay with him after they cross paths at a Nazi rally, and this self-tortured Humbert Humbert soon becomes the most endearing character in the movie despite his swastika bedspread and penchant for muttering Edgar Allan Poe as a come-on. Aside from the raging anti-Semitism, he seems like a pretty decent guy! Lillian doesn’t seem to have much of a moral compass, but identifying that strongly with anything bigger than yourself — good, evil, or anywhere in between — is so cringe that she has to move on the first chance she gets. It helps that everyone she meets believes in her at first sight. Everyone sees her as the perfect screen on which to project their own narrow view of the world. That’s true of the self-obsessed filmmakers who “discover” Lillian on the street (they’re played by Ayo Edebiri and Jeremy O. Harris, both very funny as hyper-talkative artists who assume that everyone sees the genius of their inane period piece). It’s true of the hunky movie star who turns her into the paparazzi’s latest cause célèbre (Jacob Elordi), and it’s true of the set PA Mohammed (Rish Shah), who’s convinced that he alone can “save” her. For her part, Lillian is happy to adopt a different identity at the start of each chapter; the ferocious bite of Ryder’s shark-like performance is further deepened by the sharpness of her cheekbones, which are so high and angular that each new persona looks good on Lillian even as they slide off her face like an oversized mask. She always was something, she never is something, and the movie around her seems unsure if that’s sustainable. On the one hand, Lillian is the only character who avoids the embarrassment that naturally attends sincerity, and there’s a palpable degree of wish fulfillment baked into a character who so convincingly doesn’t give a shit (even though everyone is obsessed with her). To paraphrase one of the people she encounters, Lillian is Teflon enough to defy a digital culture that force-feeds her a series of unworthy choices, and she emerges from every encounter unscathed… whereas other characters are liable to get their heads blown off. In a film that adopts a “South Park”-like approach to making fun of everyone, Lillian is never the butt of the joke. On the other hand, there are a few fleeting moments in which “The Sweet East” confronts its heroine with something approaching self-awareness. Her wanton use of the word “retarded” — a slur that the Dimes Square crowd embarrassingly tried to reclaim as an expression of their freedom from liberal moralizing — feels at first like an unfortunate side effect of a movie that allegedly features appearances from Peter Vack and Betsey Brown (their names appear in the credits, but I never clocked them on screen). Later, however, someone coolly confronts Lillian about that habit, leaving her at a total loss for words. When another character snipes that they “don’t like being told things about myself,” it almost sounds like the movie is admitting to a posture of its own — that it’s recognizing that lack of belief as a belief system unto itself. It would be easier to buy any of that if “The Sweet East” didn’t begin to scramble as soon as it felt itself in the crosshairs, but the anarchic energy of its first half gives way to diminishing returns down the home stretch; the big swings become more labored, and the small eye-pokes become duller at much the same pace (it’s hard to top the weird DJ dick monsters who pop up about halfway through). “EVERYTHING WILL HAPPEN,” a semi-accurate title card screams at the very end of the film, but precious little of it will matter. Williams’ film knows that, and owns it, and shoves it in your face until the very last frame, as if letting it go would be akin to surrendering the high ground of its own superiority. That’s the one thing “The Sweet East” can’t really afford to do. This is a fun — and sometimes very funny — movie that is virtually impossible to make fun of in return, and at the end of the day, that might be the only metric of success that matters to it. “The Sweet East” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "title": "Tom Cruise ‘Appreciates the Ridiculousness’ of His Public Persona, Says Simon Pegg",
        "content": "Tom Cruise may have been applauded for saving Hollywood amid the pandemic, but the “Mission: Impossible” actor is staying grounded, according to his “Dead Reckoning” co-star Simon Pegg.“My relationship with him is just very simple and amiable,” Pegg said during BBC Radio 4’s “Desert Island Discs” (via People magazine) of working with Cruise for almost two decades. “It’s always been a very easy relationship. I think you realize, when you meet the person rather than the thicket of mythology that’s built up around them, it’s a different experience.”Pegg added of Cruise, “I mean, he loves [the fame] and really relishes it — it’s all he knows. It energizes him and spurs him on. He kind of appreciates the ridiculousness of it sometimes.”The “Shaun of the Dead” actor previously joked that Cruise “maintains his authority by never being to blame for anything” and is well-liked on set.“I’ll pull him up on stuff and I can be frank with him,” Pegg said. “But he’s still Tom Cruise. When you’re on set, he’s the boss.”Pegg continued, “People have these opinions about him, which are based entirely on gossip, and he doesn’t really do anything to combat that. When I hear people speculating about his weird religion and making assumptions about who he is as a person, I say, ‘You know he risks his life for his audience?'”Pegg applauded Cruise’s dedication to a lack of stunt doubles, saying, “There’s a frisson you get when there’s authenticity: the idea that this guy is actually jumping off a cliff on a motorbike and deploying the parachute 100 feet from the ground? It puts the willies up you.”Cruise infamously performs his own stunts, including piloting military planes for “Top Gun: Maverick” and defying death (and gravity) atop a motorcycle for the upcoming “Dead Reckoning” film. The upcoming installment also “wrecks” a 70-ton train, per the vision of director Christopher McQuarrie.“At the start of this movie, I said to Tom, ‘What do you want to do?’” McQuarrie shared. “He said, ‘I want to drive a motorcycle off of a cliff. What do you want to do?’ And I said, ‘I want to wreck a train.’ We’re enormous fans of Buster Keaton, John Frankenheimer, David Lean, all of these filmmakers who at one time or another had a fabulous train wreck. I thought, ‘I’ve earned that, I want to wreck one too.’ I think the energy that went into developing it, designing that, building it, and then making a sequence that justified its existence was probably the biggest challenge of my entire life.”",

        "content": "Sydney Sweeney is in her letting-loose era.The “Euphoria” and “White Lotus” Emmy nominee told IndieWire that upcoming rom-com “Anyone but You” unlocked a new level of comedy in her career. Sweeney marks her first foray into the romantic comedy genre alongside “Top Gun: Maverick” breakout and “Set It Up” leading man Glen Powell for the rated-R comedy, co-starring Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Alexandra Shipp, Michelle Hurd, Darren Barnett, Hadley Robinson, Bryan Brown, and Gata.“I feel like I learned from everybody. I worked with Dermot, Rachel, [director] Will Gluck. Everybody on set were just comedy legends,” Sweeney said while on the red carpet for HBO’s New York screening of her upcoming “Reality.” “I feel like we just laughed every day.”She added, “That’s what I learned, which was to have fun and be crazy and let loose and not be self-conscious about anything.”“Anyone but You” is helmed by Will Gluck (“Easy A,” “Friends with Benefits”) from a script co-written by Ilana Wolpert. The film is billed as a modern retelling of William Shakespeare’s “Much Ado About Nothing,” with Sweeney and Powell starring as two college arch-nemeses who reunite years after graduation for a destination wedding and pretend to be a couple for their own personal reasons. Sweeney is executive producing for her Fifty-Fifty banner.Sweeney will soon be seen in HBO Films’ true crime drama “Reality,” centered on ex-Air Force member and NSA translator Reality Winner who was imprisoned for the unauthorized release of government information to the media — leading to FBI director James Comey being fired for the investigation into how Russian interference affected the 2016 election.“I actually wasn’t familiar with ‘Reality’s’ story,” Sweeney said of received director Tina Satter’s script, which uses dialogue from Reality Winner’s real interrogation by the FBI. “I was completely blown away by the fact that it was a real transcript. You can’t write dialogue like this. Once I realized this was the real conversation, I knew I had to dig even deeper and figure out what it was.”Sweeney called the performance “claustrophobic,” adding, “You have your space being invaded and as the minutes go on, the walls just feel like they’re shrinking in and her world is fully closing in on her. I can’t imagine watching and reliving that moment. She definitely supports the film and her mom and sister have watched it with us but it would be hard to watch it back in real time.”",

        "title": "Why Martin Scorsese Gave ‘Schindler’s List’ to Steven Spielberg After ‘Last Temptation of Christ’ Backlash",
        "content": "Martin Scorsese is opening up about why he chose not to direct “Schindler’s List.”The Oscar winner revealed in a wide-ranging interview with Deadline that he ultimately decided to hand “Schindler’s List” over to Steven Spielberg after the reception to his own controversial 1988 film “The Last Temptation of Christ.” The film depicted the life of Jesus Christ — including temptations toward lust — in ways that sparked outrage from some Christians.“For ‘Schindler’s List,’ I hired Steve Zaillian, and Steve and I worked on the script. I was about to direct it. But I had reservations at a certain point,” Scorsese said. “Don’t forget, this is 1990, I’d say. I did ‘The Last Temptation of Christ’ in 1988. The whole point of that movie was to start a dialogue about something which is still important to me, which is the nature — the true nature — of love, which could be God, could be Jesus. I’m not being culturally ambivalent here, it’s what’s in us. Is God in us? I really am that way; I can’t help it. I like to explore that. I wanted a dialogue on that. But I didn’t know about all that yet.”He continued, “So, I did ‘Last Temptation,’ I did it a certain way, and ‘Schindler’s List’ was scuttled by its reception. I did the best I could. I went around the world. Any arguments, I took ’em on. I may have been wrong, but I’m not sure you can be wrong with dogma. But we could argue it.”Scorsese was concerned that his own Christianity would impact the reception of Holocaust drama “Schindler’s List” if he directed it.“In the case of ‘Schindler’s List,’ the trauma I had gone through was such that I felt to tackle that subject matter…I knew there were Jewish people upset that the writer of ‘The Diary of Anne Frank’ was gentile,” the “Killers of the Flower Moon” auteur said. “I heard that there were people who complained about Schindler, that he used the inmates to make money off them. I said, ‘Wait a minute.’ I could, well, not defend him, but argue who he was. I think he was an amazing man, but I didn’t know if I was equipped for it at that time. I didn’t have the knowledge.”Enter: Spielberg.“I remember Steve Spielberg, over the years, mentioning it to me all the time. He held up the book when we [were] on a plane going to Cannes, and he said, ‘This is my dark movie and I’m going to make it.’ That was back in 1975,” Scorsese recalled. “And I said, ‘Well, I have “The Last Temptation of Christ,” and I’m going to make that.'”Scorsese continued, “I used the phrase at the time, ‘I’m not Jewish.’ What I meant was, it’s the old story that the journey had to be taken by a Jewish person through that world, and I think Steven also learned that. He came from, where is ‘The Fablelmans’ set, Phoenix? He told me there were only 200 Jews in Phoenix. I couldn’t believe it. Because I come from the Lower East Side, and grew up with the Jewish community. I wasn’t being altruistic, but it just made sense to me that he was the person who really should go through this. I was concerned that I wouldn’t be able to do justice to the situation.”Scorsese also pointed out that his own career status might have ultimately hurt the 1993 period piece film directed by Spielberg, which went on to win seven Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay.“I guarantee you, if I did it, it would not have been the hit that it became,” Scorsese said. “It may have been good, that I can tell you. I had some ideas. Most of it’s there. I had a different ending. I admired the film greatly. But I know that my films just don’t go there. They don’t go to the Academy.”Scorsese won his first directing Oscar in 2007 for “The Departed” after 13 nominations, including for “The Last Temptation of Christ.”“You’ll say, ‘But you’ve got so many nominations!’ Yeah, that’s true. But when Paul Schrader and I were not nominated for Best Screenplay and for directing ‘Taxi Driver,’ that set the tone,” Scorsese said. “I realized, ‘Just shut up and do the films.'”",

        "title": "‘Monster’ Review: Hirokazu Kore-eda Riffs on ‘Rashomon’ in a Poignant Melodrama About Rushing to Judgment",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Well Go USA releases the film in theaters on Wednesday, November 22.Scary as it sounds, “monster” can be such a strangely comforting word. Not only does classifying someone as inhuman absolve us from acknowledging the most difficult aspects of our shared humanity, it also reaffirms the smallness and simplicity of an infinitely complex universe that continues to expand no matter how much we might want to wrap our arms around it. “Monster” is a period at the end of a sentence; it’s the permission we give ourselves to demonize whatever we don’t understand.And, for all of those reasons, it’s also a very unexpected title for a new feature by the great Hirokazu Kore-eda, whose achingly humanistic stories of families lost and found (e.g. “Shoplifters,” “Still Walking,” “After the Storm”) have never had any use for such a stiflingly judgmental term. And yet, in the wake of a pandemic that exacerbated so many of society’s worst impulses, Kore-eda felt compelled to make a film that dismantles it completely. A dense and looping melodrama that spirals towards its core idea with the centrifugal force of a Christopher Nolan movie, “Monster” is one of those movies that — from its title on down — invites the audience’s worst assumptions of its characters so that it can show us our blind spots when the story eventually circles back to fill in the blanks.Paul Haggis’ “Crash” may be an unkind comparison for a film that just as frequently evokes the likes of Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s “Cure,” but it’s not an altogether unfair one, as some of the more contrived moments in Yuji Sakamoto’s script betray a didacticism that has seldom appeared in Kore-eda’s previous work. At the same time, however, this knotted yarn about misunderstood kids at the mercy of a reactionary adult world also contains moments of heart-piercing sensitivity so honest and true that even the most dedicated Kore-eda fans might not realize that he didn’t write it himself.“Monster” is the only movie that Kore-eda has made in his native Japan since winning the Palme d’Or for “Shopkeepers” in 2018 (“The Truth” was set in France, and last year’s “Broker” in South Korea), but his decision to direct someone else’s script for the first time since 1995’s “Maboroshi” suggests a filmmaker who’s still eager to push himself out of his comfort zone. So does the film’s opening chapter, which summons a different (and far more disturbing) shade of darkness than he previously invoked in the likes of “Distance” or “The Third Murder.” “Monster” begins with a deliberate fire at a hostess bar in a lakeside Japanese town, and the identity of the arsonist responsible becomes the biggest of several mysteries in a movie whose narrative is sustained by the inertia of unanswered questions. Our first suspect: A sullen and shaggy-haired fifth-grader named Minato (Soya Kurokawa, another in Kore-eda’s seemingly infinite supply of immaculate child actors), whose widowed single mother Saori (“Shoplifters” stunner Sakura Ando) is already concerned by her son’s recent behavior. Minato’s newfound demands for privacy are par for the course at that age, and Saori has no reason to believe that her son is assembling molotov cocktails behind his locked bedroom door, but Ando searches her co-star’s face with the agitated discomfort of a parent realizing that they don’t know everything about their kid’s life anymore. As Minato begins to complain about bullying, repeat cryptic things he heard at school, and suggest that he was physically assaulted by a teacher named Mr. Hori (Eita Nagayama), Saori’s anxiety inflates to existential proportions. By the time Minato pulls a Lady Bird and barrel rolls out of his mom’s moving car, “Monster” is halfway towards becoming a full-blown horror movie about a mother’s fear of losing her son to forces beyond her control, and Kore-eda — expertly inverting his usual empathies — mines a wicked degree of everyday terror from the sequence in which Saori goes to Minato’s school for a meeting with the principal. It’s here that Kore-eda first begins to expand on the definition of his film’s title, broadening it to accommodate all manner of the unknown.Considering the weight that Sakamoto’s script will later put on the word “alien” in a very different context, the “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” vibe of Saori’s parent-educator sit-down feels eerily deliberate. Hori himself, smiling and haphazard, acts like he’s never interacted with a human before, and the fact that he teaches all of his classes in a tracksuit doesn’t exactly do anything to ease Saori’s concern. Everyone at the school reacts to her complaint as if Hori just hit her kid in the face by accident (“We’ll learn from our mistake” is a common refrain), and the feeling that she’s entered some kind of bizarro world only grows more pronounced with the first of the film’s many unreliable reveals: Her precious Minato isn’t being bullied, he’s the one doing the bullying. We’re told that Eri (Hinata Hiiragi), a cheerfully androgynous classmate prone to wearing frilly jumpers, is actually the victim in all this.  It’s around then that “Monster” doubles back around to the start in order to depict the same period of time from Hori’s perspective, a trick that will be repeated in several different ways as it comes to define the film’s figure-eight structure. The shift from one POV to another is never absolute — “Monster” isn’t as neatly divided among its characters as something like “Rashomon,” nor does it have the same interest in challenging the objective fact of its events — but each cycle through this story complicates what we know by giving us more information, as the creeping dread of Saori’s chapter gives way to a more ambiguous kind of social unease. It’s an approach informed by the gaps in our understanding of each other, and one that both mimics and triggers the human tendency to bridge those gaps in bad faith whenever that might be the easiest way to make sense of the unknown. Needless to say, Mr. Hori may not be as cruel as Saori assumed. In fact, there’s something frustratingly predictable about the way that many of this film’s most odious characters are redeemed by additional context, as the opposite almost never proves true. The one major exception to that rule involves the story’s most heinous rumor, which pans out in a way poignant enough to deserve its own movie (thus making its awkward integration into this one that much more of a sore spot), but all of these bombshells turn out to be in the service of the film’s most obvious and tender reveal. That truth is hinted at throughout, but its final confirmation is powerful enough to recategorize the entire movie around it as it finds Kore-eda pushing himself even deeper into territory he’s never really explored before.“Monster” clearly has a lot on its mind, and its jumbled chronology isn’t always well-suited to make room for everything this film is trying to do. The script’s destabilizing structure has a tendency to soften the impact of otherwise piercing moments — as is often the case with stories that don’t let you in on what they’re really about until their dying minutes — and some of the sacrifices it makes while scraping closer to the “monstrousness” feel too severe to justify the structural conceit. Ando’s performance peaks with a bone-shivering display of muted parental horror at the end of the film’s initial time loop, and her frequent absences from the remainder of the film are so pronounced that it seems like Kore-eda has forgotten something along the way. But “Monster” also takes advantage of its strange chronology in some powerfully unexpected ways. A stray shoe acquires an extra layer of heartsick meaning every time someone tries it on, while the sound of an errant trombone blast from the school music room echoes with rich new resonance after we learn who it came from. The universe always keeps expanding, one character explains, and time will reverse itself once the whole thing finally snaps. Perhaps then, Kore-eda suggests, the “wrongness” that people use to explain the things we don’t fully comprehend — in each other and themselves — will be reversed as well, and even the misunderstood characters at the heart of this unusual film will be reborn into the people they always were.“Monster” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.",

        "content": "Tom Hanks‘ take on artificial intelligence hasn’t aged a day.The Oscar winner, who credits Robert Zemeckis‘ groundbreaking animated film “The Polar Express” with pioneering deepfake technology in film, weighed in on the current A.I. debate during “The Adam Buxton Podcast.”Hanks is confirmed to co-star opposite Robin Wright, Paul Bettany, and “Yellowstone” breakout Kelly Reilly in Zemeckis’ comic book adaptation “Here,” set across a series of years. The upcoming film will use Metaphysic AI technology to include deepfakes.“This has always been lingering,” Hanks said. “The first time we did a movie that had a huge amount of our own data locked in a computer — literally what we looked like — was a movie called ‘The Polar Express.’ We saw this coming. We saw that there was going to be this ability in order to take zeros and ones inside a computer and turn it into a face and a character. Now, that has only grown a billion-fold since then, and we see it everywhere.”Hanks added of the impact of A.I. on Hollywood, “I can tell you that there [are] discussions going on in all of the guilds, all of the agencies, and all of the legal firms in order to come up with the legal ramifications of my face and my voice — and everybody else’s — being our intellectual property.”Yet the technology could mean that actors’ careers could last forever onscreen.“What is a bona fide possibility right now, if I wanted to, I could get together and pitch a series of seven movies that would star me in them in which I would be 32 years old from now until kingdom come,” Hanks said. “Anybody can now recreate themselves at any age they are, by way of A.I. or deep fake technology…I could be hit by a bus tomorrow and that’s it, but my performances can go on and on and on. Outside of the understanding that it’s been done by A.I. or deep fake, there’ll be nothing to tell you that it’s not me and me alone, and it’s going to have some degree of lifelike quality.”The “Forrest Gump” actor noted of audiences, “Without a doubt, people will be able to tell, but the question is, will they care? There are some people that won’t care, that won’t make that delineation.”“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” features a de-aged Harrison Ford, with the actor revealing that it was essentially a deepfake of his own face placed over his current acting body. Marvel mega-producer Joe Russo speculated that entirely A.I.-generated films are “two years” away from being mainstream. The issue of A.I. potentially taking over writing roles has also been part of the ongoing WGA strike.",

        "title": "‘Strange Way of Life’ Review: Pedro Almodóvar’s Gay Western Short Leaves You Wanting More",
        "content": "It’s no secret that Pedro Almodóvar flirted with the idea of directing “Brokeback Mountain” in the early 2000s, the flamboyant Spanish auteur understandably convinced that Annie Proulx’s gay cowboy drama could make for an ideal English-language debut. He eventually moved on from the project (as he recently explained to IndieWire), believing that his interpretation of the material would be more carnal and unashamed than Hollywood was then prepared to accept. Almost 20 years later, Almodóvar is still trying to break through the language barrier and make an “American” feature of some kind, but the 30-minute “Strange Way of Life” — his second English-language short — finds him desperately trying to make up for lost time. Tantalizing to watch despite boasting all the staying power of a stray tumbleweed, this chatty little Western reflects on the repressiveness of its genre while mining a rich vein of conflict from the mutual acrimony shared by its two lead characters, who once dreamed of a life together, only to let that dream slip through their fingers because they lacked the ability to imagine it made flesh. There was no model for them to follow — no signpost toward that particular corner of the American frontier.Now, thanks to some deep-pocketed friends at YSL (whose Anthony Vaccarello designed the film’s costumes), the fleeting but expectedly florid “Strange Way of Life” allows Almodóvar to offer his cowboys the opportunity that Jack Twist and Ennis del Mar never had — and to enjoy the opportunity they never got to give the filmmaker in return. It won’t come easy, even if “Strange Way of Life” opens with a literal model (Manu Rios) luring its estranged characters back together with a song. Both men in this film are mighty bitter about the one that got away — perhaps not unlike Almodóvar, himself — and both keep their long-frustrated desire locked tight in a holster of ulterior motives. When they reunite in the fittingly named desert outpost of Bitter Creek (actually the Spanish town of Almeria, where Sergio Leone shot the iconic spaghetti Westerns that Almodóvar does his best to ignore), it turns out that both men have itchier trigger fingers than they might want to admit. A seemingly carefree rancher played by a smiling Pedro Pascal (who serves a movie star-worthy about-face from his tortured work in “The Last of Us”), Silva makes a beeline for the cold-blooded local sheriff the moment he arrives in Bitter Creek (a gruff and grumbly Ethan Hawke embodies the lawman with enough jaded aplomb to make you wish this movie gave him a lot more runway). The two men initially seem like a mismatched pair, but it’s only a few short minutes before they’re slurping down hot soup and tearing off each other’s chaps. Almodóvar leaves most of the sex to our imaginations — what happens in the bedroom above the sheriff’s office stays in the bedroom above the sheriff’s office — but Hawke and Pascal still manage to squeeze more heat and tenderness into a single fade-to-black than “The Power of the Dog” allowed for in its entirety. Besides, at this point, it might be a little prosaic for a transgressive queer trailblazer of Almodóvar’s stature to get off on the sight of two Hollywood stars enjoying a same-sex romp, even in Western drag.Of course, Almodóvar doesn’t tailor himself for the Western so much as he forces the Western to tailor itself for him. All the genre tropes that squeeze their way into “Strange Way of Life,” from milky white skylines to Mexican standoffs, serve the tempestuous and typically Almodóvar-ian emotions that burn inside its characters. Lest you forget it, Alberto Iglesias’ score is always there to remind you, its see-sawing strings evoking Hitchcock instead of Ford. Almodóvar has said that he built this short around the loaded conversation that Silva and Jake share the morning after their make-up romp — that he was compelled by the idea of allowing two queer cowboys to articulate the same emotions that Ennis del Mar had to choke down his throat. Even without fuller context, it’s palpably cathartic to watch Hawke and Pascal share their characters’ hearts with all the freedom promised by the Wild West. It’s the most thrilling display of any kind in a film that feels somewhat muted for something with so little time on its hands, and would even if not for its double nature as a glorified YSL commercial. (The costumes are exquisite, none more so than the emerald green jacket Silva borrows from James Stewart’s character in “Bend of the River,” which looks so great that the horse he’s riding seems to dance across the desert sand.) The colors are brilliant and the emotions pitched to match, but anyone hoping to see Almodóvar’s take on a shootout or a full saloon may have to settle for a flashback in which Hawke and Pascal’s impossibly beautiful stand-ins shoot bullet holes into barrels of wine and then slather each other’s bodies with the spillage. It’s the kind of scene that only Almodóvar would bring to the Western, and also the kind of scene that “Strange Way of Life” offers in all too short supply. Even knowing that the film is only 30 minutes long with credits, its ending still feels unexpectedly abrupt, as Almodóvar leaves us at the precise moment he’s been seeing in his head for the last 20 years. Like everything else about this project, it’s a bit of a cock-tease, but now that it finally exists, there’s no telling what might happen next.  “Strange Way of Life” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Sony Pictures Classics will release it in theaters later this year.",

        "title": "Anna Nicole to Pamela: Two Netflix Documentaries Try to Find New Context for the Blonde Bombshell as Cultural Icon",
        "content": "Now that Britney is free and Pamela Anderson did Broadway, it’s time for Anna Nicole Smith’s day in court — and not the bankruptcy kind. Six years after MeToo dragged all the musty old skeletons out of every industry’s closet, we seem to have finally arrived at the end of respectability politics for women. Gone are the days when a media outlet can report what a victim was wearing or if they were drinking. In interviews surrounding her successful sexual abuse lawsuit against Donald Trump, the writer E. Jean Carroll felt perfectly comfortable saying she once thought Trump was handsome. And a victim’s sexual history is no longer fair game — certainly not since Stormy Daniels may be the key to a potential Trump felony conviction. As a secondary consequence of MeToo, there has been a major shift in the way we speak, write, and think about women’s bodies, looks, and sexuality. Along with this growing awareness comes a retroactive reframing of the misogynistic narratives around certain women — particularly women who embraced and cashed in on their sex appeal. A slew of recent film and television projects have revisited the archetypical blonde bombshell, a revered figure who with one wrong move can fall into the less respected category of the blonde bimbo. While the 2022 Marilyn Monroe biopic “Blonde” leaned too heavily (and voyeuristically) into the victim narrative, two Netflix documentaries have tried to salvage her spiritual heiresses from the wreckage of a cruel and misogynistic media. Released a few months apart on Netflix, “Pamela, a Love Story” and “Anna Nicole Smith: You Don’t Know Me” take two approaches as different as their subtitles. As Anderson is still living, “Pamela” is fully authorized and made with her participation. While that can pose some challenges for a documentary’s journalistic credentials, in the case of “Pamela” and filmmaker Ryan White, it led to a more respectful and insightful film. The starlet’s journey from Playboy model to “Baywatch” actress is a typical Hollywood success story, until a leaked sex tape unfairly ruins it all. What for most was a trashy tabloid story was for Anderson either an unforgivable betrayal by the man she loved, or a criminal invasion of privacy. What’s more, she never saw a dime of the profits from the infamous tape. Throughout “Pamela,” Anderson is open and vulnerable, sweet with her sons and mother, and insightful about the path her life has taken. She feels vindicated and rejuvenated by a successful run on Broadway as Roxie Hart in “Chicago,” giving the film a triumphant note to end on. With her story fully in her hands, she guides the ship well, and the film feels more like a love letter to herself than an ode to romantic partnership. Smith, unfortunately, is not alive to speak for herself. Though her story is similar in some ways to Anderson’s, it’s complicated by drug addiction and a relentless desire for fame. Both women came from humble beginnings. Both were Playboy centerfolds, first appearing in the magazine just a few years apart. But Smith was much more calculating in her ambitions, telling friends at the strip club that she was going to be a famous model. (Anderson, in contrast, was discovered on a jumbotron.) When Smith met billionaire J. Howard Marshall, she undoubtedly saw her ticket out of rural Texas. The subjects in the film, including her former lawyer, maintain that she and Marshall truly loved each other. In phone audio and home videos shown in the film, they do seem to share genuine affection and care for each other. His death in 1995 resulted in a long and protracted inheritance case that eventually led to the Supreme Court. After she died in 2007, the case carried on, but her estate has never been awarded anything. It’s easy to get caught up in the salacious details of her life, and the film is not immune to this temptation. Directed by Ursula Macfarlane, the film takes a dry and basic approach to the subject matter, though it’s largely sympathetic to Smith as a tragic figure. Macfarlane lays out the timeline of Smith’s struggle with addiction, her big breaks (“The Hudsucker Proxy”), her downfalls (slurring her words at the 2004 Billboard Awards) and her comeback (Slim-Fast). The last act is when things really start to unravel, as Macfarlane introduces more and more subjects to narrate the events leading up to her death and the death of her son, both from overdoses. An interview with her former friend Melissa ‘Missy’ Byrum reveals that they were lovers, a previously unknown revelation that floats by without commentary. At no point does anyone point out the larger cultural forces working against Smith, including the nasty portrayals in the media or the way her sexuality was used against her. The most insightful remarks are about the dark side of fame, and those come from the paparazzi who followed her religiously in the ‘90s. The fact that these men were considered close enough to Smith to be interviewed for the film speaks volumes in itself. The mistakes of the past can only be corrected if they’re fully interrogated. Clearly, there is an appetite for nostalgic stories about pop culture, but they must go beyond mere regurgitation with a few flashy reveals. The film touches lightly on “The Anna Nicole Show,” a short-lived reality show that made fun of Smith more than it rehabilitated her image. “You Don’t Know Me” is in danger of falling into the same category, only repackaged for today’s shrewder audiences. There’s value and interest in reframing women’s stories, but it has to be done right.",

        "title": "‘The Creator’ Trailer: John David Washington Saves the World from A.I.",
        "content": "What happens when the world implodes at the hands of artificial intelligence?Gareth Edwards‘ “The Creator” stars John David Washington as the last hope for mankind after A.I. detonates a nuclear warhead on Los Angeles. Per the official synopsis, amidst a future war between the human race and the forces of artificial intelligence, Joshua (Washington), a hardened ex-special forces agent grieving the disappearance of his wife (Gemma Chan), is recruited to hunt down and kill the Creator, the elusive architect of advanced A.I. who has developed a mysterious weapon with the power to end the war…and mankind itself. Joshua and his team of elite operatives journey across enemy lines, into the dark heart of AI-occupied territory, only to discover the world-ending weapon he’s been instructed to destroy is an A.I. in the form of a young child (Madeleine Yuna Voyles).“Execute her, or we will go extinct,” the teaser trailer, set to Aerosmith’s “Dream On,” warns.The film is directed by Edwards (“Rogue One,” “Godzilla”), who co-wrote the script with Chris Weitz. The cast is rounded out by Allison Janney, Ken Watanabe, and Sturgill Simpson.This is Washington’s latest big-budget action role since 2020 Christopher Nolan epic “Tenet.” Washington also starred in Netflix political thriller “Beckett” and recently appeared in David O. Russell’s “Amsterdam.” He is set to also lead the film adaptation of Broadway play “The Piano Lesson” alongside Samuel L. Jackson. Washington’s brother Malcolm Washington is directing the August Wilson production for the big screen, which also stars Ray Fisher and Danielle Deadwyler.“The Creator” additionally comes on the heels of Oscar winner Janney’s action-hero debut in Netflix’s “Lou.” Janney teased that she learned how to “be a badass” for that stunt-heavy role, something that she no doubt emulates with “The Creator.”“The Creator” is produced by writer-director Edwards, Kiri Hart, Jim Spencer, and Arnon Milchan. The executive producers are Yariv Milchan, Michael Schaefer, Natalie Lehmann, Nick Meyer, and Zev Foreman. The film hails from 20th Century Studios, New Regency, and Entertainment One.“The Creator” premieres September 29 in theaters from 20th Century Studios. Check out the trailer below.",

        "title": "‘Fast X’ Review: Massive ‘Fast & Furious’ Endgame Explodes Into View with an Outrageous New Villain",
        "content": "Justin Lin may no longer be in the driver’s seat of the “Fast & Furious” franchise, but his blockbuster fingerprints are all over “Fast X.” The tenth — and most outrageous installment yet — in the ongoing fast-moving franchise delivers on its promise of high-octane thrills while very clearly setting-up a finale to the massive series, entering every living player from its past into the race. Though Lin’s abrupt departure put the fate of the franchise in jeopardy, French director Louis Leterrier has a solid command of explosive and heart-pumping action scenes to take it for spin.Relying on homages to past stunts (like Diesel’s Dom Toretto driving out of a moving plane) and surprise appearances by long lost characters, the movie lays the groundwork for a possibly three-part finale (as Diesel has indicated). Whether it has any new tricks up its sleeve still remains to be seen, though it’s unclear if that matters to its many diehard fans.Following the mantra of go ginormous or go home, “Fast X” rallies its many disparate characters against a shared enemy. (Never mind that some of the more forgettable ones would have been better left alone.) Operating on the adage that “the enemy of my enemy is my friend,” this installment brings previous rivals together to stop a demonic psychopath who will stop at nothing to teach Dom the painful lesson that he can’t save everyone.It must be gospel in Hollywood that every leading man reveres and studies Heath Ledger’s Oscar-winning Joker performance, proven out by Jason Momoa’s outrageously flamboyant take on the aggrieved villain Dante. Often laughing maniacally at his own evil genius, Dante drives a purple car, and sports silk pants and purple nails, because: “It tones down the masculinity, which we all need these days.” This winking nod at shifting norms might be less complicated to enjoy if it wasn’t said while giving pedicures to a group of corpses. Instead, Universal is engaging in the oldest trick in the book, using flamboyance (read: queerness) to signal psychopathic supervillain. Pitted against the raging paternalism of Dom Toretto’s singular guiding purpose to protect his family at all costs, the moral edict is crystal clear.Resurrecting the genetically engineered prior baddie from her own lair, the real action begins when Charlize Theron’s Cipher appears on Dom’s doorstep to warn of an evil like the world has never seen. “I always kinda thought it was me,” she admits, perhaps to the audience. “So that was kinda disappointing.” She arrives at Dom’s family abode bleeding and injured from an ambush, in which she singlehandedly fought off about fifty dudes with nothing but her fists. Waltzing giddily into her headquarters, Dante turned her security against her in an instant by kidnapping all of their children. With Dom’s son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) in play, it’s clear who Dante’s eventual target is (and where the action is headed).Now 12 years old and able to sustain his own B-plot, Brian gets his own mini road movie while on the lam with Uncle Jakob (John Cena). Introduced as the tepid villain of “F9,” Dom’s long lost brother fits much more easily into the family as the good guy he was always meant to be. Tasked with keeping Brian safe, he and the kid set out on a charming little side adventure that offers a sweet diversion from the flashier antics. Cue adorable hijinks surrounding the nostalgic magic of mix tapes and lessons in swearing.The same can’t be said for the other members of the extended family, though they certainly start things off with a bang. Running point on an operation in his namesake city Rome (a confusing choice), Roman (Tyrese Gibson) heads up the dream team of longtime favorites Tej (Ludacris), Han (Sun Kang), and recently introduced hacktivist Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel). But the for-hire job ends up being a trap set by Dante in order to lure Dom to come to their rescue. When a truck of what they think is computer chips ends up carrying a massive bomb, suddenly a simple heist turns into a world-saving mission.Dom and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez, smooth as ever on her signature motorcycle) arrive just in time to avert literal fall of Rome, starting the movie off with an epic Italian chase scene that looks like the “Bourne” films on steroids. Though they manage to avert catastrophe by a hair — and with no casualties! — Dante’s plan to implicate them in a terrorist attack on Rome works, and Dom and his family are suddenly personae non grata at the CIA. Once Roman and crew go into hiding in London, their meager action languishes under the pressure of being the comic relief, as well as having to run into old friends (Jason Statham’s Shaw) and new (Pete Davidson?!).With their old CIA contact Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) mysteriously in the wind, Dom and the family find themselves the target of unsympathetic new boss Aimes (Alan Ritchson). Luckily, Dom is saved by a rogue agent determined to fulfill her father’s legacy, a cheerful but competent Brie Larson as his new CIA ally Tess. Defying her shifty new meathead of a superior Aimes, Tess tracks down Letty in a remote black-ops site, reuniting her with her old pal Cipher for an epic escape and survival plan.With Dante’s fixation on proving to Dom that family isn’t forever, motivated by his back story, it’s only natural that the climactic battle end in an epic chase for Brian’s survival. Dom has to make some sacrifices along the way, but not before yet again landing a race car from a moving plane, and driving full speed down the side of a Hoover-sized dam. The action delivers, but the film‘s third act suffers from an excess of set-ups, cameos, and minor deaths played up as major losses. After all, they have (at least) two more to go.Universal Pictures will release “Fast X” in theaters on Friday, May 19.",

        "title": "Michaela Watkins Is the Character Actress You May Not Recognize but Definitely Adore",
        "content": "You know Michaela Watkins, right? She was on “Saturday Night Live” and was the star of “Casual” and “Enlightened.” You’ve heard her voice work on “Big Mouth” and “Robot Chicken,” and she was in indie gems like “In a World,” “Sword of Trust,” and “Thanks for Sharing.” You know her from somewhere.“I get to work all the time, and nobody really knows who I am,” she recently told IndieWire. And, as Watkins makes clear, that’s no complaint. She’s got a great acting career, one that started quite late by Hollywood standards. A former member of improv troupe The Groundlings, she spent a decade bumping around in single-episode, minor-role stints before spending a year as an “SNL” featured player in 2008.From there, she spent a season on “The New Adventures of Old Christine,” starring opposite another former SNL star, Julia Louis-Dreyfus — who’s now her co-star in Nicole Holofcener’s “You Hurt My Feelings,” which premiered at Sundance this past January. The A24 title follows Beth (Louis-Dreyfus) after she discovers that her husband Don (Tobias Menzies) secretly hates her newest novel. She turns to her sister Sarah (Watkins) for support, but she’s navigating bumps in her own marriage to Mark (Arian Moayed) stemming from their own professional issues.Ahead, Watkins tells IndieWire the hard truth about casting, willing work into existence, why you should treat everyone as a peer and how, in her spare time, she plans to work toward eradicating white supremacy.The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.IndieWire: How often, just in your daily life, do you run into people who are like, “What do I know you from?”Michaela Watkins: Yeah, it’s weird. Do I just have a really bland face? Because people will say, “Oh, where do I know you from?” And at the time, maybe it was “Casual.” And they’re just like, “Oh, who’d you play on it?” And I’m like, “The person, the lead person.” But it’s fine, and I get zero hassle anywhere I go. I get to work all the time, and nobody really knows who I am.You must love to work, because it seems like you always are. Do you? And if so, why?Nobody’s ever asked me that before. I do love to work, on the right thing. I’m so happy now, because I feel like I get to work on the right things, the things that make me really excited and really happy, even if my part is not the most interesting thing off the page, I’m [still] a fan of the project that I’m working on or the people that I’m working with. That juices me a lot.But why do I love to work? Meaning, purpose. I feel I’m in that small percentage of people who get to do for a living what I actually love to do and to be a part of, so I’m very grateful all the time. When I’m at work, I’m always like, I’m so happy that this is my job.I still never stop being grateful, I think also because this kind of work came to me later in life. I’m not a child actor, and I certainly didn’t hit my stride in my twenties. I was a waitress and a bartender to my mid-thirties. So I think it’s like with my husband, I met him at 39, and I’m obsessed with him, because I know what else is out there.Walk me through your casting on “You Hurt My Feelings.” Surely, Nicole just called you up to ask you to play Julia’s sister. That’s how this works, right?[Laughs] I love that. Here’s the real order of how this happened: I was at the premiere for “The Dropout,” and Nicole was there because she’s friends with Elizabeth Marvel, who played Elizabeth Holmes’ mother. And this is why the pandemic was sort of screwy, because it is so important to leave your house. This was my first red carpet event since the pandemic started, and I’m dressing up and putting on Spanx and uncomfortable shoes.And I was like, “Why do we do this?” And this is why we do this. Because at this premiere was Nicole, who I hadn’t seen in years. And she said, “Oh my God, I’m making my movie.” And I said, “Oh, that’s so great.” She said, “I’m making it with Julia.” And I said, “That’s amazing. That’s magic. The two of you are back together, the band’s back together.” And then I said, “Does she have a sister?” And she said, “No, she has a best friend.” And I said, “Oh.” And she goes, “And it shoots in New York. Do you live in New York?” And I said, “No.” And she said, “Oh, well.” And I said, “Oh, well.”And then a few weeks later, my manager calls, who’s also a huge Nicole Holofcener fan and knows that I am too, and said, “If you can figure out a way to live in New York, would you go do this film? Would you fly yourself there? Put yourself up and go do this film?” And I said, “I would do that. For Nicole, I would do that, not for anybody else.”[When I talked to Nicole then], she said, “I thought about it, and I think it makes more sense that they’re sisters.” I read it and I could see that there would be a version where they were friends, but, to me, sisters is so much better for the movie. I don’t think it occurred to her until I said, “Does she have a sister?” Low-key, because I’ve always wanted to play Julia’s sister. That’s the only reason I said that.On set, were you and Julia improvising? You are very natural as sisters.Nicole writes the way we speak. We share a brain cloud together or something. I feel like I speak Nicole, Julia obviously speaks Nicole, Nicole speaks Julia, Nicole spoke me. It had so much ease. Before we started shooting, we all sat down with Tobias and Arian, and we went through the whole script and we would talk about scenes and if somebody had an idea of how it could punch up. Nicole would just hear things out loud, and if something didn’t sit right with her, she would say, “That’s dumb. Don’t say that.” Sometimes we would all put our brains together and try to top it in the room, so that when we went to go shoot, I felt like we had really kind of excavated everything pretty well.There’s no bang, bang, shoot, shoot in her movies. There’s no explosions. It’s really just the subtleties of how we feel all the time. We could all sit here and navel gaze and go on and on about our feelings, but there’s something about the way she writes, where she gets a very abstract idea and notion about dynamics between people and how they feel and condenses it into short scenes.Especially when it comes to your work on television, you really seemed to roll with the evolution of what a TV comedy is, going from something more traditional like “The New Adventures of Old Christine” to something more out-there like “Search Party.” You make it look easy to go from these different things, and you fit right in all these different places. How do you do that?I love what you just said so much, I’m just going to marinate in that for half a second.I would say that what I have under my belt and what I’m really for grateful for The Groundlings School, and then I was in the Sunday company for a year and a half, where you kind of have to write a new show every single week. You have to constantly reinvent the wheel in your comedy, not just because you have to do fresh scenes every week, but because I have to show and prove myself to the main company that, if they bring me in, that I can hit all the notes. If you want to be cast-able in everybody else’s stuff, you’ve got to have a nice range and play the straight woman and play wacky, loony, zany. That place stretched me in a way that I sometimes, low-key — why do I keep saying low-key? Did I say that? Is that my second time saying it today?It might be!I never say that. I’ve never said those words before. I’m just watching some weird TikTok or something. Anyway, my point is, I worry that I might not be stretching myself enough now, and I sometimes worry, what if I atrophy in my comedy, because I’m not forcing myself into other realms enough? Maybe I’m just paranoid about that, because I think my brain is still my brain, and I still drive around being like, whoa, thinking this and that.You also are often working with the next generation of comedians, and I read a number of your previous interviews where you were talking about them and you called all of them “peers.” You’re not like, oh, these young little scrappy upstarts. To you, it seems like everyone is a peer.I definitely [think that], because everybody is teaching me stuff. I think if I was working with young people who were like me when I was that age, I don’t know what I would think, because I don’t know what I had to offer at that age. I am really impressed with young people right now, especially Gen-Z, I feel so much hope. It’s sad that we’re handing them [so much] shit, but they see the world so beautifully, because they’re not hung up on any of the shit that I was. I’m just so curious to see what they’re going to be like as adults. I hope I live long enough to find out.I always learn so much from everybody. I just do. Maybe it’s because I don’t have my own kids that I’m stuck in this warped timelessness where I like to hang out with 80-year-olds in a knitting group, and I like to hang out with 18-year-olds.Recently, my friend was having a party, and I walked into his daughter’s room, and there were seven other teenagers sitting in there, and I was going to get my coat, and they all got quiet when I walked in. All of a sudden, I felt really self-conscious, and I was like, “So, what are you guys talking about?” And they go, “Gender.” And I paused, and was like, “Do you have any questions?” And then my friend’s daughter pauses and looks at me and goes, “No, do you?” And I was like, “Yeah, I do.”Have you reached a point in your career where other people are casting roles based on you? You seem like the kind of performer that casting directors are like, “We need a Michaela Watkins energy for this.”I know that there’s been some commercial things that people have sent me where they say, “I’m going out for a commercial, and they said I’m a ‘Michaela Watkins type.'” And I was like, I’m available. I’ll do it. What’s the money? So that has made me laugh, but I don’t know. I’d like to think that that’s true. I would be immensely flattering if that was true. I do have friends who send me, they’ll take a secret snapshot of somebody at the grocery store, and be like, “This is your next character.”You’re in what we love to call the Beloved Character Actress Era, much like your “Tiny Beautiful Things” co-star Kathryn Hahn was a few years ago. Would you want a career like Kathryn, where you’re suddenly above the title on shows or leading your own Disney+ thing?Yeah, is the short answer. I don’t have a longer answer. I love Kathryn, and I very much would love the Kathryn trajectory, for sure.So, has Marvel called yet? Has Disney called yet?I think there was a “checking my avails” at one point, but then they went another way. I would totally be down for that. I also feel like I’m such good material for that, because they’re a little offbeat and odd. They go there, and I go there, and so I’m like, “Let’s go there together. Why haven’t you called me?”If you had told me 10 years ago that Julia Louis-Dreyfus was going to be a Marvel big bad, I would not have believed it.I know. I know! But maybe they’re good on character actresses in the Marvel universe.You’re also in this period of your career, where things you were in before, there’s constant rumors of them being rebooted. Is there anything that you’re precious about where you’re like, no, please don’t do it?If they rebooted “The Backup Plan” with J. Lo, that might be weird. Are we childbearing age anymore? I don’t know. But I [have not heard] the rumor that they would reboot “Enlightened,” that would be unbelievable. I would do anything with Mike White, of course, and Laura Dern. She was a masterclass, just watching her. I have never seen anything like it.What is something that you want to do that you have not yet done?A period biopic.Oh!I was locked and loaded with that answer, wasn’t I?Yes, you were. Not many people are.I want to embody somebody who is a known presence, but who we’ve never gotten to know. I’m kind of making two of my hopes and joys as one, which is to do a biopic about somebody and a period piece. If they can be the same, that’s great.I would love to play, I don’t know, whomever. I don’t even care. I would play Kellyanne Conway if the opportunity came up. I want to get a dialect coach, and I want to go full immersive. I just want to just bury myself. I also want to do something where I play multiple characters [in one project].Right now, my biggest job is trying to get all these women to Denver for June 5 for Here 4 the Kids [an event in which thousands of women will descend on Denver to demand that Governor Polis sign an executive order banning new gun sales and issue a buy-back order], since gun violence is the number-one killer of children. This is a movement.When I was in England for four months just now shooting a show, and everybody there said, “Oh, I love America, but I want to go, but I’m so afraid the guns.” We became those people, the people who are afraid to come visit you. You’re afraid to let your kids go visit. I think we need to call it out for what it is, which is white supremacy. I mean, this whole Second Amendment thing is rooted in white supremacy, so I don’t know if we’re ever going to conquer guns unless we can really dismantle that or at least acknowledge that they’re part and parcel.I’m going to put this out there. And I’m going to put “Marvel, call her” out there. Let’s see what we can do.Thank you!A24 will release “You Hurt My Feelings” in theaters on Friday, May 26.",

        "title": "Johnny Depp Denies Comeback with ‘Jeanne du Barry’: ‘I Don’t Feel Much Further Need for Hollywood’",
        "content": "Johnny Depp is addressing the ongoing controversy surrounding his latest film “Jeanne du Barry.”Oscar nominee Depp shared during the film’s Cannes press conference on Wednesday that he does not “feel boycotted” personally by Hollywood anymore — even despite protests around his latest film in Cannes.“Did I feel a boycott by Hollywood? Well, you’d have to not have a pulse to feel at that point, ‘None of this is happening, it’s just a weird joke or I have been asleep for 35 years,'” Depp said during the Cannes press conference. “Of course, when you’re asked to resign from a film you’re doing, because of something that is merely a bunch of kind of vowels and consonants floating in the air, you feel a boycott.”Depp has previously been outspoken about being a victim of cancel culture surrounding the abuse allegations from ex-wife Amber Heard; Depp won a defamation suit in 2022 against the “Aquaman” actress.He added, “Do I feel a boycott now? No, not at all. I don’t feel boycotted by Hollywood because I don’t think about Hollywood. I don’t have much further need for Hollywood myself. I think it’s a very strange, funny time where everybody wants to be themselves, but they can’t, they must fall in line, conform and if you want to lead this life, I’ll be on the other side.”Depp leads writer/director/star Maïwenn’s French royal period piece “Jeanne du Barry.” Maïwenn has been accused of assaulting a French journalist, which she seemingly admitted to during her own press tour.“You believe what you believe. The truth is the truth,” Depp said. “Maybe people talk about the film in this way or they’ll talk about your work in a certain way, but the fact is they’re all here because we made a film, not because we have a product to sell but we made a film.”Depp continued, “I was surprised to be chosen for this role. Yeah, I thought someone had made a terrible mistake. Maybe you want to try a French guy as King Louis. She thought about it for a second. I thought about it for a second. It was brave of her to choose some hillbilly from Kentucky.”As for his own image being reflected in the role, Depp added, “You need to figure out a way that the viewer can forget who you are, all the baggage you carry… that was my biggest hope that the viewer would forget who had in front of him.”Depp called the recent claims on his character “fantastically, horrifically written fiction” amid his losing roles, such as in the “Fantastic Beasts” franchise.“The majority of you who have been reading for the last five or six years, with regards to me and my life — the majority of what you’ve read is fantastically, horrifically written fiction,” Depp said. “The fact is, we’re here to talk about the film. But it’s like asking the question, ‘How are you doing?’ But what’s underneath in the subtext is, ‘God, I hate you.’ That’s the sort of media thing.”Even fielding questions over his presence at Cannes is further proof of such bias, Depp noted.“The focus should be about the fact that it’s a miracle to get a film made that you care about in the first place, so you succeed right there. But to get a film like this made and with the caliber of people and the vision of a forward-moving artist, that should be the real focus,” the “Edward Scissorhands” star said of the “Jeanne du Barry” Cannes premiere. “All this stuff that you can stuff your shoes with or line your parrot cage with [is irrelevant].”As for calls for Depp to be banned from the festival, he said, “So we’re talking theoretically, what would I do if people didn’t want me to come to the Cannes Film Festival? What if one day they did not allow me, under no circumstances, no matter what, I cannot go to McDonald’s for life? Because somewhere, if you’ve got them all in one room, there would be 39 angry people watching me eat a Big Mac on a loop just for fun. Who are they? Why do they care? Some kind of some species, some tower of mashed potatoes, covering the light of a computer screen, anonymous with apparently a lot of spare time. I don’t think I’m the one that should be worried. People should really think what it’s all about really.”But Depp still isn’t considering his 2023 Cannes premiere part of a “comeback” of any kind.“I’ve had about 17 comebacks, apparently,” Depp summed up. “I keep wondering about the word ‘comeback,’ because I didn’t go anywhere,” Depp said. “As a matter of fact, I live about 45 minutes away. Maybe people stopped calling. I don’t know what their fear was at the time. I didn’t go nowhere. I’ve been sitting around. So ‘comeback’ is almost like I’m going to come out and do a tap dance or something like that.”Reporting by Eric Kohn.",

        "content": "Tom Cruise has done the impossible: resurrected theaters and completed mind-blowing stunts.The certified movie star leads Christopher McQuarrie‘s “Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning – Part I,” kicking off the two-part finale to the decades-long franchise. Cruise reprises his role of undercover CIA agent Ethan Hunt in the seventh film, soon to be followed by “Mission: Impossible 8” in June 2024. Cruise has played Ethan for close to 30 years since the films began in 1996 with Brian De Palma’s feature.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, and Vanessa Kirby are back in their respective roles, while new cast members include Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff.“Dead Reckoning” will exclusively have a theatrical release in part due to Cruise’s urging. Production for “Dead Reckoning Part I” was repeatedly halted by the COVID-19 pandemic but eventually wrapped in September of 2021 with the budget ballooning to upwards of $290 million. Test screenings began in March 2023.Paramount Global president Bob Bakish called the film “insane” and “a complete thrill ride,” praising lead star Cruise’s dedication to his death-defying stunts including a motorcycle sequence.“I had about six seconds once I departed the ramp to pull the chute and I don’t want to get tangled in the bike,” Cruise detailed of the intense stuntwork. “If I do, that’s not going to end well.”A 70-ton train is also “wrecked” onscreen in an action sequence that director McQuarrie called the “biggest challenge” of his career.“At the start of this movie, I said to Tom, ‘What do you want to do?’” McQuarrie shared. “He said, ‘I want to drive a motorcycle off of a cliff. What do you want to do?’ And I said, ‘I want to wreck a train.’ We’re enormous fans of Buster Keaton, John Frankenheimer, David Lean, all of these filmmakers who at one time or another had a fabulous train wreck. I thought, ‘I’ve earned that, I want to wreck one too.’ I think the energy that went into developing it, designing that, building it, and then making a sequence that justified its existence was probably the biggest challenge of my entire life.”“Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning – Part I” premieres July 12 in theaters.

        "title": "‘Occupied City’ Review: Amsterdam Plays Itself in Steve McQueen’s Rich but Stultifying Four-Hour Documentary",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. A24 releases the film in limited theaters on Monday, December 25.A four-and-a-half-hour World War II documentary that doesn’t include a single frame of archival footage or talking head testimony, Steve McQueen’s provocative but emotionally stultifying “Occupied City” refracts the fading memory of Nazi-occupied Amsterdam through the prism of the city’s more recent COVID lockdown — a rare pause in the flow of time, and one that McQueen eagerly seized upon as a chance to measure its powers of erosion. The film’s conceit is as simple as it is almost immediately numbing: Each of its 130 fragments is dedicated to a different address throughout the city, the past and present of these sites fractured across two parallel timelines that are offered to us all at once. While our ears listen to monotone narrator Melanie Hyams list off the war crimes that took place at a particular location in the early 1940s, our eyes watch similarly clinical — if far more benign — 35mm footage of the same address as it existed during the early 2020s, when the people of Berlin were forced to abide by the first city-wide curfew since World War II. Amsterdam wasn’t bombed as often as other European cities, and that lack of erasure makes it a uniquely lucid setting for a film so compelled by how the present lives alongside its memory of the past. The darkest chapter of Amsterdam’s history wasn’t erased or razed to the ground, it was simply refurbished (while Hyams’ voiceover notes that several of the film’s locations have been demolished since World War II, it’s unclear if those haunted lots were targeted for exorcisms). Blissfully oblivious children play in the same park where Himmler once inspected Nazi soldiers. Girls attend high school in a building that was once home to Hitler’s secret police. Hopeful messages are graffitied across the pandemic-shuttered walls of the G-Star clothing store that now sits on the very spot where the first “No Jews” sign was hung after the German occupation began. These flashpoints stand out in an epic whose typical episode is simultaneously more specific and banal. The cold open, in which an old woman shuffles into her cellar for supplies while Hyams’ voice reads a list of the Jews who once hid down there, is positively action-packed compared to many of the snippets that follow. It gains further potency from being the first passage in a film whose relentless inventory of disembodied atrocities is designed to become white noise of the worst kind, as McQueen’s technique somewhat damningly suggests that we’re less inclined to forget history than we are to tune it out. To that end, half-listening to Hyams’ unfeeling narration as it repeats whatever awfulness once happened at this storefront or on that street corner emulates the split awareness of Amsterdam itself, a city whose past is still palpable enough to feel like a low whisper in your ear. At no point during the interminable running time of “Occupied City” does the whisper grow any louder than that. McQueen’s pointillistic approach invites our minds to wander freely between then and now, his film less interested in shuddering at the specifics of its awful facts than it is in probing our ever-evolving relationship to them, but the documentary’s monotonousness resists deeper engagement. For all of the fascinating questions it raises along the way, watching this thing in full ultimately feels less instigative than it would be to isolate any single one of its 100+ parts. “Occupied City” is based on a book written by historian and filmmaker Bianca Stigter (McQueen’s partner), whose “Atlas of an Occupied City (Amsterdam 1940-1945)” provides the template and the full text for McQueen’s film. A door-to-door inventory of Amsterdam’s losses during the occupation, the book’s sum of objective details snowballed into a wrenchingly vast catalog of the violence that visited almost every inch of the city. Like Alain Resnais before her, whose “Night and Fog” extrapolated the horrors of the Holocaust from the piles of shoes and hair that Auschwitz victims left behind, Stigter understood that the unfathomable is better conveyed through scale than narrative. Her own documentary, last year’s harrowing “Three Minutes: A Lengthening,” unpacked three minutes of pre-war home video into a feature-length microcosm of what Hitler stole from history. While the 262-minute “Occupied City” is technically more of a shortening than anything else, as McQueen’s film omits several hundred of the addresses that were included in its source material), its patience-testing running time still promises a payoff that never comes. Its slow accumulation of details fails to create the kind of emotional undertow that might reward the decision to present this A24-funded project as a four-hour film instead of an installation piece that viewers could dip in and out of at their leisure. Striking as it is to consider the sheer immensity of the horrors that Amsterdam experienced during the occupation, even more striking is how quickly they soften into background noise. Instead of interrogating the present’s relationship with the past, “Occupied City” more frequently recreates the conditions of its natural obliviousness: The past is fixed, and the present is always moving further away from it. McQueen’s film speaks to that tension ad nauseam, as its nonlinear accounting of Nazi-occupied Amsterdam doubles as a strictly chronological document of the city’s pandemic years (starting with the announcement of the first lockdown, and ending sometime after the restrictions were lifted). And yet, seeing the city through McQueen’s detached — even clinical — point of view, Amsterdam seems to be in the throes of forgetting itself. At least that’s the most generous interpretation I could rescue from the long sequences in which McQueen pairs footage of the city’s recent anti-lockdown protests with narration about the city’s anti-Nazi resistance. In a vacuum, conflating the two would seem to be in wildly bad faith. But in a film where a housebound kid gets to play with an Oculus Rift VR headset in the living room rather than hide from the Gestapo in the attic, that read doesn’t quite pan out. McQueen stops short of mocking those who likened the inconvenience of public safety measures to the horror of fascism, but he appears to be struck by the fact that Amsterdam, of all cities, would have so little perspective on what it actually means to be oppressed (the rising specter of actual fascism is kept in the background, lest this film risk sparking a palpable sense of urgency, but the threat doesn’t go unacknowledged).Much, much later, McQueen’s camera lingers on a climate rally in the same park where the Nazis once gathered, as if to offer a more hopeful take on the idea that the future is always beckoning us forward, even when the past is struggling to make itself heard (as a speaker says at an event in honor of the African slaves who were abducted to the Netherlands: “Reconciliation around a shared past makes room for the future”). Too torpid to capture how time moves through a city, McQueen’s film is more successful at articulating how a city like Amsterdam moves through time. What does it choose to remember, and what does it allow itself to forget? Is architecture a vessel for memory, or a monument to its absence? If nothing else, “Occupied City” reflects a world that’s inundated with the raw facts of history like never before. And, both in spite of and because of its tedium, McQueen’s film recognizes that how we relate to those facts will determine the future we inherit from them. “Occupied City” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. A24 will release it later this year.",

        "title": "Cannes 2023 Opens with a Celebration of Cinema as a Communal Experience",
        "content": "For the most part, the opening ceremony of the 76th Cannes Film Festival was a tightly scripted affair. The show, which was broadcast live across the country from the Lumiere theater on the public television channel France 2, included an honorary Palme d’Or for Michael Douglas, who stumbled through a speech from a teleprompter at the back of the room and bungled a few words of gratitude in French. Catherine Deneuve came out and read a poem about Ukraine. Host Chiara Mastroianni offered the usual platitudes. “The cinema has never abandoned us,” she said. “We, in turn, must commit ourselves to it for the next 10 days.”Yet when jury president and Swedish director Ruben Östlund took the stage after a generous montage of his acclaimed satiric work, he appeared to improvise a speech about the value of watching movies together. “Back in the day, we were gathering in front of the TV,” he said, “but the only content that we watch together in Sweden now in front of the TV is the Eurovision Song Contest.” The audience laughed along. “All other content we are scrolling on small individual screens alone in our rooms,” Östlund said. “My point is that when we are watching things like this alone, we are processing images in a completely different way. It doesn’t demand us to think. The algorithm that is curating the content basically only wants us to keep on watching.” By watching movies with a crowd, he added, “just the fact that someone is sitting next to you and might turn to ask you what you thought means you have to take a standpoint. … I think it’s important that we are in one of those rooms where we are processing the content we are watching.”It was an intriguing observation to kick off a festival entrenched in its traditions, from the European filmmaking that dominates the program to the formalities of the screenings themselves. Watching movies at Cannes isn’t just about whatever projects onscreen; the environment becomes part of the show.The opening ceremony was followed by “Jeanne du Barry,” French director Maiwenn’s engaging, airy portrait of Louis XV’s favorite lover, played with an air of playful rebellion by the provocative filmmaker herself. The role of the king falls to Johnny Depp, a controversial figure in the U.S. but one who was welcomed with plenty of cheers when he arrived at the theater. As the lights went down, one tux-clad audience member couldn’t help but shout, “We love you, Johnny!”The movie won’t do much to alter Depp’s complicated reputation in the wake of his court case with Amber Heard, but as a fairly minimal presence in the movie, its potential doesn’t solely rest on his appeal. While U.S. buyers at the screening ranging from Sony Pictures Classics to MUBI seemed intrigued, Netflix is also a player in the conversation since it helped finance the project. However, the movie recalls another era of arthouse cinema: “Jeanne du Barry” drifts through the romance at its center with the old-school likability of a commercial French movie that would have played like gangbusters at the Lincoln Plaza a few decades ago.Now, its prospect in that kind of market were less clear. SPC co-president Michael Barker told IndieWire after the screening that he liked the movie, but said “I haven’t had a chance to think about it yet” when asked if he might consider taking it on. Time will tell, but the main Cannes crowd was ready to move on. Depp skipped the official festival dinner in favor of the film’s own afterparty, but over 600 people — largely press and industry — crammed into a dining hall at the Carlton Hotel for the opening dinner after the movie. Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences CEO Bill Kramer sat with Berlinale chief Carlo Chatrian as they discussed the future of exhibition in the streaming era.While the Academy is expected to reassess its theatrical requirements for Best Picture in the coming months, the Cannes policy about theatrical releases remains unequivocal: Films in competition for the Palme d’Or must receive a theatrical release in France. Chatrian said that Berlin’s policy was more fluid, merely requiring that films at the festival must receive a release in some fashion around the world — not necessarily in Germany. “I think streaming and theatrical will become more and more distinct,” he said. The vapor from Deneuve’s e-cigarette wafted past them from a few seats down. She sat with her ex-husband, former Cannes president Pierre Lescure, who stepped down from his role last year with the election of new festival leader Iris Knobloch, the first woman to hold the role. Knobloch, a former WarnerMedia executive, is known more for her business acumen than cinephile bonafides. Addressing the Cannes crowd for the first time, Knobloch singled out Östlund. “You have that incredible talent to immortalize everyday events and the moments that turn sour,” she said. “Standing up here I can’t stop thinking of Ruben’s film ‘The Square.’” That Palme d’Or-winning takedown of the fine art world includes a memorable performance art sequence in which affluent dinner guests are thrust into the center of disturbing, confrontational performance art as the celebratory air gives way to fear. At the Cannes dinner, no such chaos unfurled, though there was a lingering uncertainty about how the next two weeks would go. Seated across from Deneuve was John C. Reilly — the head of the Un Certain Regard jury — alongside his wife and producing partner Alison Dickey, who remarked that American movies produced in the low-seven-figure range were impossible to get made now. Nearby, sales agent Vincent Maraval (whose longtime Wild Bunch factory has been rebranded Goodfellas this year) peered around the room, hunting for buyers. Jury member Damian Szifrón, whose “Wild Tales” was a Cannes hit back in 2014, said he was plotting a sequel. His fellow juror Paul Dano looked pleased to be playing a different kind of role for the next 10 days. “I don’t think I’ve ever watched three movies a day like this before,” he said. “I’ve got to get some sleep.”",

        "title": "‘Tiger Stripes’ Review: A Malaysian Coming-of-Age Drama, Complete with TikTok Dances and Teen Body Horror",
        "content": "One of many terrible phrases coined in Britain during its long, foundational Victorian era was “too clever by half.” The term originally described a person whose intelligence was their downfall (think: a classic Greek god). In the years since its creation, it’s been more widely used to describe a person whose sheer smarts mean they ought not to be trusted (think: Scar from “The Lion King”). The term, and its problematic use, certainly apply to the star of “Tiger Stripes”: Zaffan (Zafreen Zairizal), a 12-year-old girl whose rural Malaysian village seems far too small and parochial for the scale of her wild wit and personality.In Amanda Nell Eu’s film, Zaffan soon becomes the ringleader of a band of unlikely rebels, including Farah (Deena Ezral) and introvert Piqa (Mariam), just as changes in her body remind her she won’t just be one of the kids that much longer. That makes her something of a trendsetter at her small religious school; it also means she’s alone in what she’s going through. Her anxious mom (Jun Lojong) and emotionally absent dad (Khairunazwan Rodzy) are not much help. And her teachers are actively unhelpful: Zaffan is told to “hold it in” during one difficult moment, leading to a public embarrassment that only worsens her sense of isolation — and challenges the “innocence” that her school deems so important.Writer-director Nell Eu has talked about her own fears while confronting puberty without proper sex education — who could possibly think that’s a good idea? — and that she wanted to illustrate the “monster” that Zaffan is led to believe she is. “Tiger Stripes” does just that. As the pressures of home and school continue to pile up, Zaffan’s biological changes ramp up. She grows whiskers and claws. (Her feistiness, mind you, needs no reinforcement.) Cue what “Tiger Stripes” is really about, and we’re in for quite a ride.It’s a slight shame that it takes us so long to get there, which limits just how long Zaffan gets to do the fun stuff. That elongated first act might be because Nell Eu feels she has to show us what preteen life in rural Malaysia is like, or that she wants “Tiger Stripes” to seem like less of a B-movie. Neither particularly matter. In fact, her premise is pretty close to ideal for a Gen Z-friendly B-movie (Z-movie?). And “Tiger Stripes” is certainly in touch with what girls like Zaffan, Farah, and Piqa are going through. They spend recess filming each other doing TikTok dances, of course. That also taps into what the girls’ Malay parents and teachers fear is happening to their country, particularly as secular Chinese pupils seem to be hogging the highest grades, the school headmistress (Fatimah Abu Bakar) complains.Nell Eu’s use of TikTok isn’t just a metaphor. Much of “Tiger Stripes” is shot on phones, a conceit that’s used cleverly when the girls are hanging out or when we’re supposed to see members of the public filming Zaffan during a violent outburst. (We journalists call that sort of thing user-generated content, and it’s never used for good reasons.) The phone footage is a handy way for Nell Eu and Spanish cinematographer Jimmy Gimferrer to be creative on a tight budget.That challenge becomes a little more apparent once Zaffan’s bloodlust begins: the practical effects in “Tiger Stripes” aren’t exactly “American Werewolf in London,” but its cute visual trickery does work pretty well. In full tiger mode, Zaffan bounds up trees (something the rest of her species admittedly isn’t known to do) with an almost stop-motion quality. That sort of thing might go down really well at TIFF’s Midnight Madness, for example, but higher-brow audiences in Cannes could be a little fussier.Despite those shortcomings, “Tiger Stripes” is a well-made, eminently watchable illustration of the “monster” that so many young girls are told to see themselves as. And with a crackdown on education now taking place in many parts of America, it’s rage-inducingly timely for an unlikely audience, too. Farah’s own journey, from a pal who has plenty to learn from Zaffan’s bravery and smarts, to a zealot and bully who leads a “kill the beast!” movement among her classmates, is a pretty striking allegory for how oppressive social conservatives can, and do, go on to run the world.But with its use of body horror taking a backseat just when it might have worked best, Nell Eu is seemingly reluctant to make a B-movie, having written a script that could make for a fantastic one. That makes “Tiger Stripes” good, rather than great. It just might just be too clever by half.“Tiger Stripes” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

        "title": "‘The Goldman Case’ Review: Cédric Kahn Weaves a Fascinating, True-Life Courtroom Drama",
        "content": "There is invigorating cinema to be found within the trials and travails of the French justice system. Last year proved this with Alice Diop’s brilliant “Saint Omer,” and this year, cinephiles can already add another film to the ranks of fascinating, fact-based French legal dramas: “The Goldman Case,” Cédric Kahn’s invigorating retelling of the 1976 trial involving Pierre Goldman, a Jewish radical charged with killing two women in a pharmacy robbery. Kahn uses the simplicity of his movie’s structure — the action rarely leaves the courtroom — to underline the complexity of the circumstances and the prickly figure at its center, Goldman himself, played excellently by Belgian actor Arieh Worthalter, who gives his character the fervor that apparently made him a figurehead in his day. But Worthalter ambitiously refuses to allow Goldman to be easily sympathetic, leaning into his sometimes contradictory anger. Similarly, though there are timely themes at play involving society’s racism and anti-semitism, especially when it comes to a police force, Kahn deftly avoids ham-fisted posturing, instead letting testimony speak for itself. By the time we first meet Goldman in the context of the film, he has become something of a folk hero following the publication of a memoir he wrote in prison, “Obscure Memories of a Polish Jew Born in France,” detailing his life as the son of Polish refugees. Though he readily admitted to the charges of robbery, he vehemently denied any involvement in the murders. He had an alibi, but his main defense, as depicted on screen, is almost aggravatingly simple: He didn’t do it because he didn’t do it. He refuses to allow his lawyers to offer any character witnesses because he believes his own word should be enough. But before Goldman ever appears on the screen, Kahn opens the action on two of his lawyers, Georges Kiejman (Arthur Harari) and Francis Chouraqui (Jeremy Lewin), both Jewish men. Kiejman has just received a letter Goldman has drafted explaining how he was going to fire him, pointedly calling his representative an “armchair Jew,” an insult implying passivity that speaks to the recency of the Holocaust. It’s a sequence that exists outside the otherwise claustrophobic world of the film that nonetheless establishes a crucial context for Goldman’s anger. Without too much exposition, Kahn displays the anxiety of the world Goldman occupies, where the scars of the past are tender. From there, Kahn jumps into the actual trial proceedings, portraying the strata of spectators. There are the Goldman acolytes, who have the beards and the clothing of leftists and chant his name. Then there are Goldman’s relatives, including his father, a former Resistance fighter, who remains solemn. And finally there are the representatives of the police force, challenged by what Goldman represents as a voice of anti-authoritarian resistance. The only thing that serves as the score is the bickering of Goldman’s supporters and detractors. There’s something inherently entertaining about the way the French conduct their trials, even down to the way that the members of the jury are allowed to ask questions of witnesses. Kahn milks the frenetic nature of the proceedings, as well as the high-wire emotion on display. As each subsequent witness comes to speak, he also slowly peels back the layers of prejudice that colored Goldman’s accusation, from the ways in which his Black friends were intimidated by the police to the obstinance of the cops who bristle at any charges of racism or misdoing.  Kahn films the action with the objectivity of a verité documentarian, and his and Nathalie Hertzberg’s script has the precision of a historical document. Their research reportedly involved detailed interviews with Kiejman and Chouraqui, as well as in-depth analysis of newspaper articles surrounding his trials. At the same time, this is not a documentary, but rather an ingenious act of synthesis, which combines information from one of Goldman’s previous trials and draws information from his book as well. The effect is a concise, but not uncomplicated look at this man through his legal struggles. Goldman, it should be noted, was assassinated in 1979 and the events surrounding his death could make for an entirely separate film. It’s telling that Kahn chose not to tell a broader story about this figure, whose life was filled with the kind of tragedy and spectacle that seems ripe for cinematic translation. (For instance: His mother left him to return to Poland and pursue Communist objectives; he fought with guerrillas in Venezuela.) Instead, he uses the trial as a covert character study that nonetheless exposes the ills still plaguing France and the rest of the world. With another subject, Kahn’s approach might come off as dispassionate, but Goldman is such a strangely alluring figure that he — and by association, Worthalter — give the film its fiery bent. He’s cocky and self-sabotaging, but also attractive in his cynical idealism. Unlike most courtroom dramas there are no easy answers here, no moments where music swells and victory reigns. Goldman is too complicated for that. Instead, Kahn rightfully leaves his audience mired in the questions his story raises about Jewish trauma and corrupt institutions, both today and yesterday.“The Goldman Case” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, where it opened the Directors’ Fortnight section. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.",

The first three movies were great. Number four [‘Salvation’] I was not in because I was governor. Then five [‘Genisys’] and six [‘Dark Fate’] didn’t close the deal as far as I’m concerned. We knew that ahead of time because they were just not well-written.”“Terminator: Dark Fate” marked original actress Linda Hamilton’s return to the franchise. The film bombed at the box office with only $261 million internationally grossed on a $185 million budget.Schwarzenegger reflected on his signature catchphrase “I’ll be back,” calling it “an accident” during the first “Terminator” production, helmed by James Cameron.“Jim Cameron and I were debating how to say the line because I was not comfortable with saying ‘I’ll.’ I said, ‘I think it’s stronger to say, ‘I will be back,'” Schwarzenegger remembered. “Cameron said, ‘Are you the scriptwriter now? It’s just one word. Don’t tell me how to write. I don’t tell you how to act.’ I said, ‘You tell me how to act every fucking minute! What are you talking about?!’ So he says, ‘Arnold, you think it sounds weird. It doesn’t. What makes it great is that you sound different than me or Charlie over there. That’s what makes it work. So just say it 10 times. Say it different ways. I’ll keep rolling the camera. Then we’ll choose one.’ So they set it up, and I say: ‘(Flatly) I’ll be back … (cheerful) I’ll be back! … (guttural) I’ll beeee baaaack …’ It sounded stupid.”The “Twins” actor added, “The movie comes out. I’m in Central Park. This guy comes up and says, ‘Say the line!’ Now, a few days ago, I was skiing in Aspen, and the concierge comes up asking me to say the line. So that’s where it started and where it ended up. It’s wild. I’m the last one to get complicated and say, ‘I don’t want to compare myself to my movies or use a line from my movies.’ Hell, Clint Eastwood takes the clothes from his movies and that’s all he wears. So why would I be worried about using a line?”Schwarzenegger noted he and director Cameron are still “in touch” and the “FUBAR” actor remains inspired by the filmmaker.“We went motorcycle riding when he was out here for the Golden Globes. I’ve never met anybody in the movie business who has so many different talents,” he said. “I saw that right away on ‘The Terminator’; he always knew exactly what he wanted. He never said, ‘Let’s try this,’ it was always, ‘Let’s do this’ — without any doubt.”Fellow ’80s action icon Sigourney Weaver recently announced that she is done with the “Alien” franchise, which Cameron also helmed one installment of, sequel “Aliens.”“There are all kinds of younger actors taking this kind of role,” Weaver said of the franchise continuing without her, adding that working with Cameron was the best “Alien” film.“The best-constructed story for the character to tell was in ‘Aliens,’ just because Jim [Cameron] has such an amazing sense of structure of story,” Weaver said. “To take this character out of hyper-sleep, have no one believe her, have her be exiled into this limbo land where no one believes her and her family’s dead. The whole set-up for Ripley in ‘Aliens’ and then what she ends up doing and… finding this new family by the end. The whole structure of that story, to me, was gold. I always felt that I could jump up and down on it. It was such a great, supportive, arc for the character. In that sense, the second one for Ripley is probably the most satisfying.”",

        "title": "‘Young Indiana Jones’ Coming to Disney+, Suggesting It’s Still Canon",
        "content": "Remember “The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles”? No, not the opening sequence of “The Last Crusade” starring River Phoenix as a teenage version of Harrison Ford’s iconic archeologist. We’re talking about the short-lived ’90s series starring Sean Patrick Flanery as the title character. The two-season curiosity has been mostly left behind in its decade, but now Disney has acknowledged it — and is putting it on Disney+, no less.The news was announced out of The Walt Disney Company’s Upfronts Presentation on Tuesday afternoon. The show will be available to stream on Disney+ starting May 31, in anticipation of the release of “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” in theaters next month. In addition, all four of the initial “Indiana Jones” movies — “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” “The Temple of Doom,” “The Last Crusade,” and “The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” — will also be added to the streamer, after inexplicably being left off since its launch in 2019.Although mostly forgotten today, “Young Indiana Jones” had serious pedigree behind it, and a very complicated release history. It originally premiered on ABC as “The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles,” and ran for 28 episodes from March 1992 to June 1993. Four made for TV films were released between 1994 and 1996, and the series was later edited to 22 TV films under the title “The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones” in 1999; based on Disney’s titling, it’s likely the latter cuts are the ones being put on the service.As for what the show was about, it was essentially “Forrest Gump” or “Midnight in Paris” but set in the 1910s and based around young Indiana Jones (played by Flanery as a teen and Corey Carrier as a younger child) traveling the world and getting into adventures. In the process, the young hero constantly ran into real-life historical figures, the likes of which include Leo Tolstoy, John Ford, Sigmund Freud, T.E. Lawrence, Al Capone, Louis Armstrong, Winston Churchill, and many, many more. The series also featured George Hall, as an elderly Indy in flashforwards, although Ford made an appearance in one episode set in 1950.Ford wasn’t the only member of the original films involved in the series; George Lucas created and executive produced, in addition to providing the stories for most episodes. “Young Indiana Jones” also attracted many prominent directors and writers to work on it, including Joe Johnston, Terry Jones, Nicholas Roeg, Mike Newell, and even Carrie Fisher, who wrote an episode where Indy had a romance with French dancer/spy Mata Hari.The show’s Disney+ debut marks the first time that the series has made the leap to streaming, after decades of being tough to track down. VHS editions of several episodes were released in 1999, but not the entire series. The last time the series was made available for home viewing was in 2008, when it was released on DVD to tie-in with the release of “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.” The DVDs also included an insane 94 historical documentaries created by Lucasfilm, telling the real-life stories of the historical figures seen in the show. (Rick McCallum, who produced the series, then became the main producer other than Lucas on the “Star Wars” prequel films, before leaving Lucasfilm before Disney’s acquisition in 2012.)There had been some question about whether this series, given its lack of accessibility for decades, was even still regarded by Lucasfilm (let alone Disney) as being Indy’s official backstory. If it was, indeed, still canon. Simply because Disney might have wanted to tell its own separate story about Indy’s youth at some point. But putting the series on Disney+ feels like an endorsement that this is Indy’s official history and won’t be rewritten anytime soon.Although Flanery is (presumably) not making a cameo in “Dial of Destiny,” the fifth film in the beloved series will feature a young Indiana Jones of sorts, in the form of a digitally de-aged Harrison Ford. The film, which sees James Mangold take over directing duties from Steven Spielberg, also stars Phoebe Waller-Bridge, John Rhys-Davies, Mads Mikkelsen, Boyd Holbrook, Thomas Kretschmann, Toby Jones, and Antonio Banderas. The movie will release in theaters June 30.",

        "title": "French Director René Clément Propositioned Jane Fonda for Sake of Role: ‘The Character Had to Have an Orgasm’",
        "content": "Jane Fonda is calling out late French filmmaker René Clément over on-set sexual harassment.The “Book Club: The Next Chapter” actress revealed to “Watch What Happens Live” host Andy Cohen that Clément propositioned her while filming 1964 thriller “Joy House.” The film also starred Alain Delon and Lola Albright, featuring both American and French actors under Clément’s agreement with MGM. Natalie Wood was originally set to star before dropping out; Fonda replaced the “Rebel Without a Cause” actress.Host Cohen asked Fonda to name “one man in Hollywood that tried to pick you up once that you turned down,” to which Fonda replied, “The French director René Clément.”The Oscar winner continued, “Well, he wanted to go to bed with me because he said the character had to have an orgasm in the movie and he needed to see what my orgasms were like. He said it in French and I pretended I didn’t understand.”Clément was 51 years old at the time of production; Fonda was 27.She added to Cohen, “I have stories for you, kid, [but] we don’t have time.”“Forbidden Games” filmmaker and Cannes award winner Clément died in 1996. Fonda’s statement comes on the heels of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival being protested for its inclusion of controversial filmmakers like Johnny Depp and Maïwenn, who both star in opening night film “Jeanne du Barry.” Cannes festival director Thierry Fremaux has defended their respective presences at the festival in the wake of the MeToo movement.“Portrait of a Lady on Fire” star Adèle Haenel also criticized the French film industry for defending known “sexual aggressors” like actor Gerard Depardieu, who was accused of sexual misconduct by 13 women, and director Roman Polanski, who raped then-13-year-old Samantha Geimer in 1977.“They join hands [to protect] the [Gerard] Depardieus, the [Roman] Polanskis, the [Dominique] Boutonnats,” Haenel wrote. “It bothers them that the victims make too much noise. They preferred that we disappear and die in silence.”She added that the French industry has effectively “canceled” its own #MeToo movement over the years, writing, “You have the money, the strength, and all the glory [but] you won’t have me as a spectator. I cancel you from my world.”",

        "title": "As Johnny Depp Takes Cannes, Hollywood Says It’s Ready for His Comeback",
        "content": "Johnny Depp has played Cannes many times, with four of his films in Competition: “Dead Man” and “Ed Wood” (both 1995), “The Brave,” and “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” (1998), but he’s never had this much at stake on the Croisette. As the randy King Louis XV, powdered and wigged in the opening-night Out of Competition selection “Jeanne du Barry,” Depp will begin his latest effort at career rehab.Depp, who will be 60 in a few weeks, is well past his movie-star prime and remains in recovery from a string of court cases. Depp lost his “wife-beater” U.K. libel case against ex-wife Amber Heard in 2020, but last June he won $10 million in compensatory damages in a U.S. court. Warner Bros. paid his $16 million fee for the third “Fantastic Beasts” film, but asked him to resign from playing the role of Grindelwald in the Harry Potter franchise. (Mads Mikkelsen replaced him.) While Depp’s Keith Richards-inspired Jack Sparrow fueled five “Pirates of the Caribbean” movies that grossed $4.5 billion worldwide, Disney has yet to greenlight a sixth; the studio had lined up Margot Robbie to star, without Depp.On the other hand, Depp “is still very meaningful foreign,” wrote one Hollywood agent in an email.“Jeanne du Barry” opens in France after its festival debut; while some feminists have mounted protests, Europeans seem less concerned with Depp’s lapses. “If there’s one person who didn’t take interest in this trial, it’s me,” Cannes director Thierry Frémaux said at the Cannes Monday press conference. “I don’t know what it’s about. I’m interested in Johnny Depp as an actor. Everyone knew Johnny Depp was going to be in a film in France. He’s quite extraordinary in the film. Ask Maïwenn why she cast him.”Clearly, Maïwenn cast Depp in a supporting character role. But the pony-tailed star turned up on time for the Cannes red carpet, signed autographs for excited fans, spoke French to interviewers, and posed for an eager phalanx of photographers. Reviews so far are solid if unexceptional. (Our critic described it as “perfectly serviceable,” with Depp as a minor note who “affords the French production an additional bit of luster.”) It’s unlikely to find theatrical distribution in North America.In America, Depp inspires different feelings. At Tuesday’s Competition Jury press conference, jury member Brie Larson may as well have been speaking for Hollywood when she was asked about Depp in “Jeanne du Barry.” “We’ll see if I see it,” she said. “And I don’t know how I’ll feel about it if I do.”Depp could do just fine by keeping his focus on Europe. He has his own well-funded production company, Infinitum Nihil, in London. “I’m not sure at this point in his career Hollywood has more to offer him than Europe,” wrote one indie producer in an email. “He’s not going to do ‘my daughter’s been kidnapped’ movies and how many starring vehicles for actors his age are we generating over here? He seems to be doing pretty much what he wants to do there.”Depp is now set to direct and star in “Modi,” a Modigliani biopic co-starring Al Pacino, with sales company Goodfellas (FKA Wild Bunch) seeking backers in the Cannes market. This isn’t a movie for major studios and, at a time when art-house cinemas are challenged, it’s not one that U.S. buyers will be eager to prebuy.Another Modigliani movie, “Modigilani,” starred Andy Garcia and premiered at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival to terrible reviews. Innovation Film Group opened the title in eight theaters in 2005 and it grossed $208,507 domestic. Depp’s last feature was “Minimata” (Metascore 55), Andrew Levitas’ biopic of investigative photographer W. Eugene Smith. MGM dropped the title after its Berlinale 2020 debut and Goldwyn finally released it in 2022; it barely grossed $1 million worldwide.At least Dior believes in Depp. The fragrance house just signed him to a three-year Dior deal valued at a reported $20 million-plus, the biggest ever for a men’s fragrance pact. Because sales of the Dior Sauvage fragrance skyrocketed in the wake of his widely hyped trial, Depp’s scented payday outstripped both Robert Pattinson (Dior Homme) and Brad Pitt (Chanel No. 5).However, perfume companies generally aren’t troubled by production insurance. Posing for photos is one thing, but when Depp is involved, showing up on set on time can be quite another. Trial testimony from his former agent Tracey Jacobs about his Marlon Brando-scale set misbehavior on “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,” when Depp was often late and needed to be fed his lines, was damning.Still, Hollywood may be willing to embrace the talented actor with a penchant for offbeat roles — if he can behave. I spoke to multiple producers and executives rooting for Depp’s return as that rare commodity, a bona fide movie star with an enormous fan following that took decades to cultivate. Even so: Attention will be paid.“People are ready to forgive him,” wrote one talent agent in an email. “Like Nic Cage and Robert Downey Jr., they have been flawed human beings but are endearing actors. Nic and Downey earned their redemption and it looks like Johnny is in the process of doing that, too… He would have a better chance of working in U.S. films if people can feel for certain that his bad behavior on sets isn’t going to happen again. And I’m not sure studios are sure that he’s going to be more professional at this point but they’re probably curious. If he gets a good report from the French film, that will help.”“JD has U.S. as well as ROW [the rest of the world] box office value among young moviegoers and adults alike when he plays an odd character,” wrote one director’s agent. “It’s when he does something dramatic and real that it usually seems not his strong suit.”One asset for Depp is his manager at hybrid management company Range Media, CAA veteran Jack Whigham. [He] “truly cares about him and is a great rep in general and for JD specifically,” the agent continued.Another issue is Depp’s appearance. “He also would have a better chance of working in the U.S. if he looked a little better,” wrote the talent agent. “He looks bloated and unhealthy in the few photos I’ve seen of him recently — he doesn’t look like a movie star to me. If he gets in great shape and if he’s professional (on time, knows his lines, etc.) on the films he works on now, I think Hollywood will cast him in leads again.”“People have short memories,” wrote one literary agent. “Think it will be same for Depp — unless he continues to be out of control during shooting. That has been a major black mark against him.”For now, major studios remain off limits. “It will be hard for a studio to hire him today,” wrote one studio production executive. “But it definitely will happen again if he is doing good work and not going back to imitating Peter O’Toole when he works!”The same executive thinks it makes a difference when Depp works for respected filmmakers like Tim Burton, with whom Depp collaborated eight times and earned an Oscar nomination for “Sweeney Todd.” (He also scored nods for the first “Pirates of the Caribbean film, “The Curse of the Black Pearl,” and for “Finding Neverland.”) Said the exec, “[He does] “consistently great work with noted directors…..! It doesn’t matter the size of the part!”Depp will have to accept a sizable pay cut, though. “He is a great actor so I think he is hirable,” said one studio producer. “The question is what price. My gut says 2-4 [million]. And I am sure the streamers would let him co-lead a series.”“JD is a good enough actor to resuscitate a career,” wrote screenwriter Larry Gross. “But due to age it will be as a credible character actor rather than as a leading man — he could be the kind of compelling eccentric presence that a Christopher Walken or an Ian McKellen or a Jason Robards have been in their later years.”Script consultant Nancy Nigrosh suggests that if Depp finds “a small but crucial role in something classy (classy = not based on a comic book or low-rent genre) that is perfectly tailored to his grown-up bad-boy persona, he could be seen as someone who can truly carry his own baggage.”Or, he could wind up like Joan Crawford at the end of her career, said Submarine co-founder Josh Braun on the phone. “She starred in ‘Trog,’ it was her last movie, one of the worst movies ever made,” he said. “No one else would hire her. She was a B-movie queen.”What’s perhaps most extraordinary here is after all the court trials, accusations of abuse, production-cost overruns, Depp’s fate remains in his own hands. He can make art films in European exile a la Woody Allen and Roman Polanski, or land a lucrative Hollywood streaming deal, or a string of juicy character roles for name directors. If that doesn’t happen — well, he’ll have no one to blame but himself.Additional reporting by Eric Kohn.",

        "title": "‘Jeanne du Barry’ Review: The Johnny Depp-Starring Cannes Opener Is Really Just Another Maïwenn Showcase",
        "content": "Editor’s Note: This review originally published during the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Vertical Entertainment will release “Jeanne du Barry” on Friday, May 3.Zeroing in on a glamorous notable from this or that royal court, and using them a kind of mannequin over which to drape lofty themes and embellishments, “Jeanne du Barry” is a perfectly serviceable entry in a genre born of the stage and perfected by Old Hollywood: the star showcase. That the icon in the spotlight is writer-director-lead actor Maïwenn, and not her American co-star Johnny Depp, should come as a relief to some, a crushing disappointment to others, and surprise to absolutely no one. Just look at the film’s title.Or, look to the auteur behind this year’s Cannes Film Festival opener. For those whose familiarity with the diva ends at the blue makeup she wore in Luc Besson’s “The Fifth Element,” the French director has cut her teeth with films that hew to volatile rhythms, “actorly” features that push high-decibel disputes all the way to 11 and that (almost always) find an on-screen anchor in the figure of Maïwenn herself. To call the style “self-infatuated” is less a criticism than a simple statement of fact. The auteur promises director and muse wrapped in one, with a voice louder and angrier than that of anyone else; when not on screen, all the other characters tend to ask, Where’s Maïwenn?With “Jeanne du Barry,” she has finally accessed her time machine. Opening up a gilded window onto Versailles under the Ancien Régime, the costume epic offers no shortage of luxury and no lack of visual delights, often reveling in the ostentatious displays of French monarchical power as it tracks a familiar tale of rags-to-riches-to-rags again in the court of Louis XV.Responding to the stately surroundings, Maïwenn’s previously frenetic camera slows down in turn, covering much of the action in elegant, wide compositions filled with soft light. With such a painterly visual scheme and with small drops of ever-so-wry voiceover, the film eagerly welcomes comparisons to a certain Kubrick classic, particularly in an opening chapter that tracks by what means the lowborn Jeanne Vaubernier acquired the style and title of Jeanne du Barry.Those means, of course, are carnal, though as we follow the courtesan’s professional rise, we never linger in the boudoir nor dwell on the tawdrier aspects of the plot. As spun by Maïwenn and co-writers Teddy Lussi-Modeste and Nicolas Livecchi, the script casts Jeanne as a thoroughly modern mistress carving her way across a storybook world to improve her lot in life. A business union with the Comte du Barry (Melvil Poupaud) — essentially a glorified pimp — puts Jeanne in contact with the king’s valet, La Borde (Benjamin Lavernhe). Like a wigged-and-cosseted Henry Higgins, the palace valet schools our fair lady in pomp and circumstance, ushering her through the halls of mirrors and into the king’s bedchamber, while Jeanne plays audience surrogate.And boy, what a surrogate she plays, building towards a giddy peak as Jeanne observes the king’s dressing ceremony from behind a one-way-mirror. In a delightful and cannily directed sequence, Maïwenn both crystalizes the underlying appeal of the palace genre and finds its most potent expression. Which is to say, the filmmaker recognizes that we flock to such pageantry to both revel and take the piss, and that the two reactions are mutually necessary for the whole shebang to work. Like your Twitter feed for the Oscars or a friend on the couch during the recent coronation, Jeanne acts as on-screen confidante and release valve, letting out the air in the stuffiest room you ever did see with barely stifled laughter, while from behind the camera, director Maïwenn orchestrates an ornate opera of courtiers with gravity-defying pompadours.Meeting eyes with her lover from the night before, Jeanne uses that moment to solidify her bond with Louis XV, played, of course, by Johnny Depp. Though performing wholly in French and given ample screen time, the American star leaves a strangely scant impression, offering a dim and muted turn that plays off his wider reputation in often fascinating ways.Introduced as the object of Jeanne’s gaze, and almost never seen without new mistress by his side, Louis is less subject than object, a conquest for the courtesan and a high-value get — bargained at a no-doubt cut-rate price due to extenuating circumstances — that affords the French production an additional bit of luster. For Louis is a man long gone to seed, a one-time sun king whose glow has dimmed in luxury and indulgence, but whose name — and power that still holds — endures; and if the two performers never quite kindle a spark, their narrative (and metatextual) liaison never does strain credulity.       Still, for all those self-aware touches and inspired casting winks, “Jeanne du Barry” runs out of steam awfully fast. While hewing to a historically accurate speed-run through Louis XV’s final years from his mistress’ perch, the narrative has little ground to cover once that commoner flame asserts her position at court. Rather than ratcheting tension with a third act reversal, the late arrival Marie-Antoinette (Pauline Pollmann) lays bare the hard limits of keeping Jeanne our sole center of gravity.Though both consorts would later meet sudden and similar ends in a revolution percolating imperceptibly off-screen, the film resists any and all impulse for larger thematic echoes. Like every other character, the new dauphine offers Jeanne an admirer and a thwart, but never an equal, barely a scene partner, and at no point an opportunity to enrich the biographical narrative “Jeanne du Barry” is ostensibly trying to honor.More frustrating than a misfire, “Jeanne du Barry” suffers instead from near total myopia, roaring to life with wit and ingenuity when the constellations align and the lead’s star can shine, and dwindling before the risk of any possible eclipse. The film burns hot and bright — and quickly flames out.    “Jeanne du Barry” premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.",

        "title": "Ruben Östlund Would Rather Win Another Palme d’Or Than an Oscar",
        "content": "Ruben Östlund is one of only nine filmmakers to win the Palme d’Or twice — and both movies went on to score Oscar nominations. The Swedish director’s 2017 art world satire “The Square” landed a Best International Feature Film nomination, while last year’s anarchic cruise ship opus “Triangle of Sadness” wound up notching noms in both Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay.However, when IndieWire asked him about the relationship between the Palme d’Or and the Oscar race during a press conference for the Cannes jury he presides over this year, he was unequivocal about which prize meant more to him. “For me, it’s an easy choice if I have to choose between an Oscar and a Palme d’Or,” he said. “I’d rather have one more than have an Oscar.”For now, Östlund gets to experience the other side of the equation, serving as president for the official competition jury over the next 10 days alongside an international jury that includes Paul Dano, Brie Larson, and fellow Palme d’Or winner Julia Ducournau.The lineup is a hodgepodge of global cinema and includes acclaimed auteurs such as Ken Loach (“The Old Oak”) and Hirokazu Kore-eda (“Monster”). Östlund said that the Cannes fixation on filmmakers led him to develop an obsession with the Palme early on. “I started in film school in 1995,” he said. “It was interesting because the teachers of that school, they were always talking about the history of filmmakers at Cannes. I look at myself as a European filmmaker, I’m part of a European tradition when it comes to the role of filmmaking. I think the role of cinema that we have in European culture is something that I’m willing to fight for. In my opinion of course the Golden Palme is the most important film prize in the world.”Yet Cannes has served as a major launchpad for the global side of Oscar season in recent years, with “Parasite” going from a Palme to a Best Picture win in 2020 and 21 nominations for Cannes premieres at the 2021 Oscar ceremony. The Academy has taken greater interest in the category and overall international representation over the past year, hiring a full-time staffer to oversee the international category and non-U.S. membership. Earlier this month, it revised the rules for international Oscar submissions by requiring at least 50 percent of each country’s submission committee to be comprised of filmmakers or craftspeople. Members of the Academy will be engaging with the Cannes community at the festival and hosting an event for members in attendance this week.However, Cannes artistic director Thierry Fremaux has suggested over the years that the Oscars should be a platform for American films. Asked about that conclusion by IndieWire in an interview earlier this week, he reiterated that stance. “For me, the Oscars are above all an American event, with a prize for international cinema,” he said. “In France, the Cesar for best film can only be awarded to a French film, as in Spain a Spanish film, et cetera.”Östlund acknowledged that his experiences with awards season made him appreciate the profile that the Oscars can bring. “When it comes to the Oscars, there’s a feeling that there’s an impact on more average audience,” Östlund said. “They know about that, there’s an even stronger brand around that than the cineaste brand of filmmaking.”The director was also asked at the press conference about the gender disparity in the lineup and across the industry. While there are a record seven films directed by women in this year’s competition, that’s still less than half of the overall section. Notably, the Academy has included gender parity as one possible criterion fulfilling its new inclusion standards. However, Östlund took a broader view when asked about the issue.“The problem is not only gender,” he said. “It’s class.”He added that he serves as a film professor at the University of Gothenburg and saw the limitations of state funding on filmmaking careers there. “We’re often taking people coming from working class, middle class, but they are often not continuing being directors after school because they feel financially stressed,” he said. “The financial stress that is in the backbone of the working class makes them discontinue making movies. … Even when we’re trying to achieve diversity, there’s something about financial security that makes them discontinue. You have those extra hours you have to put in and naturally they drop out.”He also noted that when he was growing up in the 1980s on Styrsö, a small island off the coast of western Sweden, his commune provided him with filmmaking resources at a young age. “We could borrow a digital camera and an editing table,” he said. “They gave it to the youth of the village in order to have something to do in their spare time. That was the reason I started to make movies. It was a communal action that made people start to work. If you start to have moving images as a subject in primary school, a lot more people will know how to use the tool and reflect on the possibility that this is moving images and move onto to making feature films.”These days, Östlund said, such educational initiatives were even more valuable. “We have 45 million cameras in the world, but we don’t really discuss in which ways images are influencing us and how we look at the world,” he said. “In these times when we are communicating so much with moving images, this has to go into the subject of primary schools.”On a lighter note, Östlund said he had few rules for his jury this year aside from requiring that they keep their opinions about the competition private. “This will be the first jury in the history of the Cannes Film Festival where the publicists will have no rumors to tell to each other,” he said. He was hoping to hold deliberations with the jury after every three films they watch. “If someone comes up to us and asks us what we thought about a film, we won’t [say],” he said.The jury press conference at Cannes is sometimes an uneventful affair since the jurors have yet to experience any of the movies. This time, however, there was much to discuss, with Dano noting that his wife Zoe Kazan was currently on the picket lines with their infant child, and Larson dodging an awkward question about Johnny Depp appearing in out-of-competition opening night film “Jeanne du Barry.” “We’ll see if I see it, and I don’t know how I’ll feel about it if I do,” she said.Ducornau, meanwhile, got asked whether her role on the jury would be impacted by the presence of a new film from Nanni Moretti (the filmmaking comedy “Towards a Bright Future”). When “Titane” won the Palme d’Or in 2021, Moretti was in competition with “Tre Piani,” which lost. On Instagram, the filmmaker posted a snarky comment a few days later. “Getting old suddenly,” he wrote in Italian. “It happens. Especially when one of your films goes to a film festival. And it doesn’t win. And instead, it’s another film that wins whose lead role gets pregnant with a Cadillac. You suddenly age.”Ducornau shrugged it off. “I will watch his film like any other film, obviously,” she said. “The great opportunity of being on the jury is that you can exercise your open-mindedness, without bias. Personally, I do not want to know anything about any movies I’m going to see. I did not read anything, I did not hear any interviews. I want to come fully as a virgin every time I get to one of these films to honor the work that the director has put in it.”For his part, Östlund said that he was hoping to set his team at ease throughout the festival. “It’s always interesting to be on a jury because there are so many group dynamics going on,” he said. “You try to create a certain kind of atmosphere where you don’t have to try to be smart all the time. They shouldn’t be scared of saying what their gut feeling is, what comes to them. If you have a jury atmosphere where everyone is trying to be intellectually smarter than one another, then you’re missing out on something. … We don’t have to be smart. We just have to follow our first instinct for how to say something, and then we will find out how to formulate that.”",

        "title": "Robert De Niro Turned Down Scorsese’s ‘The Departed’ and ‘Gangs of New York’",
        "content": "Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro have collaborated together on 10 films, but that number could have been much higher had De Niro said yes to the “Raging Bull” auteur more often.Scorsese revealed that he approached De Niro to star in “The Departed” and “Gangs of New York” prior to De Niro appearing opposite Leonardo DiCaprio for the first time in “Killers of the Flower Moon,” debuting at this year’s Cannes Film Festival.“We talked to Bob about it, but he didn’t want to do it,” Scorsese recalled to Deadline of “The Departed.” “‘What about “The Departed”?’ ‘Nah, I don’t wanna do that.’ ‘OK.’ I didn’t work with Bob for 10 years until we did ‘Goodfellas’; we went off in different directions. Then we made another two, three films. And then, for another 19 years, we didn’t…So, with Bob, after ‘Casino’ we stopped for a while and I did ‘Kundun’ and ‘Bringing Out the Dead.’ And then ‘Gangs of New York.’ We always checked in, on that and everything else.”He added of De Niro turning down the “Gangs of New York” casting, “That was just a check-in. Literally, he said, ‘What are you doing?’ ‘I’m doing this. You interested?’ ‘Nah.’ ‘OK.’ We always talked about that kind of thing, because he is the only one around who knows where I came from and who I am, from that period of time when we were 15 or 16 years old. He knows that part of New York. It was all instinct between us and his courage and his humility, in terms of how he’ll say, ‘If a scene plays on my back, fine, but if it plays better on the other person’s face, play that.'”Scorsese continued, “He wanted me to do ‘Analyze This,’ and I said, ‘We already did it. It was “Goodfellas.”‘ I talked to him about other projects, and at one point he said, ‘You know the kind of stuff I like to do with you.’ I said, ‘OK.’ That became ‘The Irishman,’ and it took nine years. We were always looking.”Scorsese noted, “Now, that was a certain period of time. Does he still think that way, 10 years later? Turns out he did! But is he the old Bob? No. You’ve got to see where they are.”The “After Hours” director reflected on his ongoing partnerships with actors like DiCaprio, citing that he feels like a parental figure over the Oscar winner and compared him to De Niro.“What happened is that I found that, because of the subject matter in many of the films, there seemed to be a comfort level [with Bob and I], not easy by the way at all, but a comfort level in knowing we could get to a place. What that place is, I may not be able to verbalize, but together we could probably find something,” Scorsese said of his longtime collaborator De Niro. “But that took also long periods of not working together, because, you know, people change. He still wanted to do certain things. ‘Casino’ really solidified it for me. That was the ultimate, in terms of that type of picture for him and me.”Scorsese said of DiCaprio, “Leo then became that way too, and a lot of it happened on ‘The Aviator.’ There were some scenes he did with Cate Blanchett that left me stunned, I thought it was so beautiful. And he learned a lot as a person; he told me he did. Maybe he was a young kid, just growing. I have daughters. I don’t have sons, so maybe it’s like we’re stumbling along and it’s almost like parenting in a way. But, wow. And then we did ‘The Departed’ and he just blossomed.”DiCaprio and De Niro both star in Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon,” based on David Grann’s non-fiction book capturing the Osage Nation serial murders during the early days of the FBI. DiCaprio and Scorsese are set to produce Grann’s upcoming book “The Wager” for Apple TV+.",

        "title": "Pixar’s ‘Elemental’ Is So Complex, It Required New Animation Technology",
        "content": "While Pixar has delivered innovative characters in recent years, including the ethereal Joe from “Soul” and the illuminating Joy from “Inside Out,” they aren’t nearly as complex as the fiery Ember and watery Wade in the upcoming “Elemental.” These two stars of Peter Sohn‘s rom-com and immigrant story (which closes the Cannes Film Festival on May 27 prior to its June 16 theatrical opening) represent the studio’s most fully simulated characters, which required creating new tools for rigging and performance along with establishing a new VFX-driven workflow.Set in Element City, where there’s tension between fire, water, air, and earth, the antagonistic first encounter between the intense Ember (Leah Lewis) and the go-with-the-flow Wade (Mamoudou Athie) eventually leads to romantic sparks. But because the character design and world-building are inextricably linked, “Elemental” cleverly strips everything down to its core essentials.Production designer Don Shank said it was “a delicate balance between physics, logic, and cartoony appeal.” Unlike most productions, though, “Elemental” was reverse-engineered because the physical nature of the characters defined their environments. Thus, Element City is a series integrated neighborhoods comprised of the organic materials that would complement (and survive) each element. And because fire is the most dangerous element, and Ember had the most screen time as the protagonist, she was developed first and became the catalyst for everything else.The first challenge was to figure out what Ember looked like. The art department looked at photo and video reference for a fire. They initially experiments with an animated face on realistic fire but that didn’t work. After realizing the need to balance realism with stylization, they virtually assembled a group of animators, tech wizards, and production people to make a computer drawing of Ember. They iterated for months creating her look, which was self-illuminating, and emphasized energy over anatomy. They did the same for Wade as water in motion, which was more complicated because of reflection and refraction, and required special attention to streamline the look and not obscure his face.“We’re used to complicated characters where the hair and the clothing are simulated, but very few times where characters are all simulated,” VFX supervisor Sanjay Bakshi told IndieWire. “The ‘Soul’ characters were volumes, but they didn’t change over time. Joy has this effervescent quality, but it’s kind of prepackaged, and it doesn’t change based on her emotions or the way she’s feeling. Ember and Wade are both fluid simulations, but the technologies are different. Ember’s flames are never particles, it’s a fluid sim from day one. She looks like [the flame] on a gas range and if you sculpted that into a character.“One of the questions we asked Pete,” he continued, “was how big of a fire is her head? He said it should be like a campfire. That’s the kind of activity of the flames and intensity that he was thinking about, so that really helped us narrow it down.”Then animation had to build a complex rig so the artists could make Ember expressive. Like Wade, she had nearly 10,000 individual controls. Once the physics-based animation was honed, the artists dialed it back with greater stylization to make her face more readable and the performance more human. The result was sophisticated sculpting and some classic squash-and-stretch, with 2D outlining to carve out her silhouette against bright backgrounds.“There was so much more collaboration on this film,” said co-directing animator Gwen Enderoglu. “Usually animation and effects don’t interact. That was a totally new pipeline for us. Ember has this kind of fiery agitation to her and so much was leveled up once they brought in [voice actor Louis]. When we started our first sequence in animation back in December 2021, we didn’t know what the final look of the film was gonna be. We didn’t know what we were making until we got in there and made it, and so that was unusual for us.”Yet what they achieved was a uniquely expressive animated character. Ember’s color changes to purple as she gets angrier, and when she moves her arms, the flames go out and reappear. Timing and spacing were difficult, though, when she’s roaming through a water park. “When that got rendered for the first time, it was really difficult to see the character,” said co-directing animator Allison Rutland. “The flames were too big and kind of blurry and so we had to develop the technology to minimize the flames through these fast actions and then get a control for the animators to tune that while they’re animating.“There were so many layers, and each aspect was dialed individually,” Rutland continued. “Too much line work and it starts to feel too cartoony, and it was always just chasing that balance that Pete was looking for. He wanted it to be 70 percent realistic and 30 percent stylized or cartoony.”One of the early scenes follows Ember on a bike making her daily deliveries through Fire Town (where she lives outside of Element City), succinctly providing a sense of her connection to the community. “And just how capable she is,” Enderoglu said. “Then, on the flip side, when she’s not in Fire Town, when she’s out at Element City, how uncomfortable she is in that space. That was not a world that was built for her to live comfortably, and how cautious and careful she has to be because they were the last [element] to move in. They were disruptive, they were the outsiders, the infrastructure was already there, so it makes for an interesting conflict.”",

        "title": "Cannes Juror Brie Larson May Not See Johnny Depp-Starring ‘Jeanne du Barry’",
        "content": "Brie Larson is steering clear of discussing Cannes opening night film “Jeanne du Barry.”The vocal member of the #MeToo and Times Up movements serves on the 2023 Cannes Film Festival jury, but sidestepped whether or not she will be viewing the opening night film starring Johnny Depp.“You’re asking me that?” Larson said during the press conference, as “Jeanne du Barry” is out of competition and therefore not a requirement for jury members. “I’m sorry, I don’t understand the correlation or why me specifically.”The “Fast X” actress added, “You’ll see, I guess, if I will see it. And I don’t know how I’ll feel about it if I do.”Larson noted that this year’s festival is her “first time here” and she would be open to Cannes including superhero films like her own “Captain Marvel” franchise some day.“I only know my perspective, and I’ve never curated a film festival,” the Oscar winner said. “I take the same level of preparation and care […] whatever the budget. A film is a film. This is my first time here. I’m sure the movies will have a wide range in scope, and that’s what makes this festival so special.”Cannes festival director Thierry Fremaux recently stood by the inclusion of controversial film “Jeanne du Barry,” especially on the heels of writer/director/star Maïwenn confirming assault allegations after being accused of attacking a French journalist.“I don’t know about the image of Johnny Depp in the U.S.,” Fremaux said. “To tell you the truth, in my life, I only have one rule, it’s the freedom of thinking, and the freedom of speech and acting within a legal framework.”Fremaux said earlier this year, “I don’t see Maïwenn’s film as a controversial choice at all, because if Johnny Depp had been banned from working it would have been different, but that’s not the case. We only know one thing, it’s the justice system and I think he won the legal case. But the movie isn’t about Johnny Depp.”Depp won a defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard, alleging he lost out on work following her abuse accusations. Fans of Heard have since started the #CannesYouNot social media campaign calling out the festival for “supporting abusers for 76 years.” French actress Adèle Haenel slammed the French film industry for protecting “sexual aggressors.”Reporting by Eric Kohn.",

        "content": "Timothée Chalamet is riding high on the chocolate river as Willy Wonka.The “Wonka” star, who showcases his triple threat talents in the “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” prequel musical film, shared with Vogue why he was drawn to take on a reimagining of the beloved Roald Dahl classic.“To work on something that will have an uncynical young audience, that was just a big joy. That’s why I was drawn to it,” Chalamet told Vogue. “In a time and climate of intense political rhetoric, when there’s so much bad news all the time, this is hopefully going to be a piece of chocolate.”“Wonka” is directed by “Paddington” helmer Paul King and co-stars Olivia Colman, Keegan-Michael Key, Hugh Grant, Sally Hawkins, Matt Lucas, Rowan Atkinson, Natasha Rothwell, Rufus Jones, and Simon Farnaby, who penned the screenplay. Chalamet’s turn marks the first origin story for the beloved novel adaptation, following the 2005 version of “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp in the lead role. Chalamet sings and dances in the musical.The first trailer for “Wonka” showed the chocolatier challenging a stuffy “chocolate cartel” that refuses to give him a chocolate shop or allow him to enter the candy-making industry. Wonka teams with a young girl who helps him realize his vision and ultimately build the iconic chocolate factory. The film is produced in part by the Roald Dahl Company. Chalamet teased at 2023 CinemaCon that “Wonka” is about a “Willy that’s full of joy and optimism and hopes to become the greatest chocolatier of all time,” and diverges from the 1971 portrayal of the character by Gene Wilder.Chalamet’s co-star Keegan-Michael Key revealed that Chalamet performs seven musical numbers in the film.“There’s this wonderful effortlessness about how he plays Wonka, not to mention the fact that there’s this hopeful quality that he gives the character, a kind of indomitable quality that he’ll never quit, he’s always up for the next thing,” Key said of Chalamet’s performance. “He’s like, ‘OK, that didn’t work out? We’ll do this and we’ll try something else,’” he said. “And Timothée Chalamet, what can I say? Sacrébleu! This kid, you know, he drips charisma and a wonderful confidence. He’s just a really delicious artist.”",

        "title": "Pedro Almodóvar on His Gay Western, Pedro Pascal, and the ‘Very Painful’ End to His Cate Blanchett Film",
        "content": "Pedro Almodóvar has been dancing with the idea of directing an English-language movie for decades, but he’s closer than ever to getting there. “I think I’m going to make it sooner or later,” the Spanish filmmaker told IndieWire over Zoom from his apartment in Madrid earlier this month. “I should be more honest about knowing my conditions.”That admission comes a few months after “A Manual for Cleaning Women,” the adaptation of the Lucía Berlin short stories that Almodóvar spent years hoping to make, fell apart a matter of months before production was set to begin with Cate Blanchett. A series of complications led Almodóvar to cancel the production, leaving the rights to the project with Blanchett’s production company.Now, Almodóvar is resurfacing with another toe-dip into English with “Strange Way of Life,” a touching gay Western short starring Ethan Hawke and Pedro Pascal that follows his first English-language effort, the Tilda Swinton short “The Human Voice,” in 2020. Almodóvar beamed about his new project, and already has two more brewing, but the collapse of the one he had planned to do next still irks him.“Even now, it’s very painful for me to think about,” he said. “I had discussed it with Cate the whole year. I had a lot of time to reflect on it. I was not afraid of the languages. I was afraid of the many locations, the many actresses. I was not sure about the time they would give me to rehearse.”Because the movie was a Spanish production, he would have been forced to recreate many of the American scenes at a soundstage in Madrid, a process made especially demanding because the director micromanages every detail of each frame. “That frightened me,” he said. “I just thought of myself having to supervise everything in a larger studio and thought it would be a nightmare. I knew the more honest thing for me to do was to write Cate and tell her that I was very sorry, but I couldn’t make it.”Having hyped the plan himself for over two years, he sounded distraught over the outcome. “I know it’s my fault,” he said, unprompted. “Perhaps I could have thought of this earlier, but you know, I didn’t have that much time.”That’s the upside to the whole ordeal, of course: At the age of 73, Almodóvar remains in the midst of a fertile creative period. He made his most personal movie with 2019’s “Pain and Glory,” scored an Oscar nomination, and directed the experimental Cocteau adaptation “The Human Voice” early months of the pandemic when few productions could chart a path forward. He cranked out diaries of his cinephile habits during lockdown and dusted off old scripts. He directed his muse, Penelope Cruz, to an Oscar nomination with his powerful indictment of post-Franco trauma “Parallel Mothers,” attacking a delicate subject he avoided for years.And “Strange Way of Life” allowed him to explore a dormant American genre that he adored from afar since his early moviegoing days. “I was interested in doing things that have not been done in the Western before,” he said.Almodovar shot “Strange Way of Life” in the searing heat of Almería, Spain last summer, with the same sets that Sergio Leone used for “Once Upon a Time in the West.” However, the short plays less like an homage to spaghetti Westerns than the sort of heated blend of romance and violence at the center of Almodovar’s work since his “Woman on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown” days.The story stars Pascal as Silva, a former gunslinger who tracks down his old lover Sheriff Jake (Hawke). The pair once dreamed of living on a ranch together hidden away from the world; now, closer to middle-age, they find themselves reunited under dicier circumstances: Silva’s son has been accused of murder and the job falls to Sheriff Jake to track the criminal down, but that doesn’t stop him from reuniting with his old paramour the night before the job. The ensuing drama is poignant and personal, but it turns on an erotic chemistry between the actors that almost feels subversive due to the two movie stars at its center.Pascal made time for the role in between the demanding production schedules for “The Mandalorian” and “The Last of Us,” the confluence of which has made him one of the biggest stars working today. “I think it really shows a range of registers he can hit that people haven’t given him yet,” Almodovar said. “I hope the audience can appreciate that.”Pascal told IndieWire via email that he first encountered Almodovar’s work when his parents took him to see “Woman on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown” in 1988, when he was 12 years old. They finally met 30 years later in New York, when Almodovar was in town to be honored at the MOMA gala and went to see Pascal in a Broadway production of “King Lear.”After the show, the directed pitched the Western backstage. “I loved the idea of Pedro addressing an era of cinema in a location that held the physical history of some of our most beloved and rebellious Westerns,” Pascal said. After the blockbuster undertakings of the past few years, he welcomed the chance to work on a smaller scale. “There’s something so much more intimate about being under the singularity of someone’s vision,” he said. “Even more so when it’s a vision that has been such influence over your creative inspiration.”“Strange Way of Life” isn’t graphic — unless you count the fleeting shot of Pascal’s butt — but the men share a series of tender moments, physical and otherwise, that demand a degree of commitment given Almodovar’s fixation on the rehearsal process.Needless to say, Pascal and Hawke make for a convincing pair. “I don’t imagine sexual chemistry as something to approach,” Pascal said. “It’s simply a matter of playing the character. Pedro put his trust in us to inhabit the story as he felt so much of the work was accomplished by casting. I think there’s a disarming and playful sexiness to everything Pedro does, so it’s exciting to step into that world. It also helped to have a scene partner as good as Ethan.”Hawke, who’s straight, laughed off the connotations of his bedroom scene with Pascal. “I did a play in 1991 where Steve Zahn and I made out so, you know, I’ve always been game for a good time,” he said in a phone interview. “I’ve done love scenes with so many wonderful actresses and they’re always so hard. Human intimacy is a very difficult thing to photograph. It starts to be about bodies and then it can be a little soulless. … I know Pedro put a lot of thought into what he was trying to communicate to the audience. He’s always trying to figure out the story he wants to tell.”It’s a significant contrast to the approach he once described for “Brokeback Mountain,” another movie that almost became his first American project before he moved on. In that case, Almodovar told IndieWire last year, he felt that the short story about two cowboys involved in a clandestine affair needed to be more carnal than he felt was possible in an American movie. At the time, he described “Strange Way of Life” as his “response” to “Brokeback Mountain,” though he was keen on clarifying now that he wasn’t referring to the sex itself. “It had more to do with a question asked in that film regarding what two men would do on a ranch together,” Almodovar said, referring to a scene where the two men dream of a future together that never comes to fruition. “I see this film as a kind of answer to that question.”Almodovar has a lot to say about his approach to sexuality without sex. “The film is full of these moments that are erotic without being explicit sexually or having to do with any kind of physical nakedness,” he said. “There’s a certain intensity, these pauses, that are very erotic and carnal for me.”The movie is strewn with references to Westerns that Almodovar has treasured for years. A flashback between the two men, in which they fire at wine barrels and shrug off some prostitutes for their own plans, stems from Sam Peckinpah’s “The Wild Bunch,” but he also envisioned Hawke’s character as an extension of archetypes in the John Sturges movies “Last Train from Gun Hill” and “Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.” John Ford loomed large for the spectacular vistas, and Almodovar said he thought a lot about “The Searchers” and “Cheyenne Autumn,” as well as “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.” Pascal wears a green jacket (supplied by Saint Laurent, which also helped produce the movie) that serves as a callback to the one Jimmy Stewart wears in “Bend of the River.” Other costumes were inspired by “El Dorado,” “Red River,” and “Veracruz.”For Almodovar, these details gave me a toolbox to build his own way into the genre. “When the Western hit the scene, it was really its own aesthetic, a language,” he said. “It is a very macho or masculine genre. With the exception of something like ‘Johnny Guitar,’ women are always like secondary characters.” The movie takes that shortcoming and turns it into a strength: The perceived homoerotic tension of the Western writ large without an iota of repression. “The characters are more naked with their words than they would be if you saw their bodies,” Almodovar said. “Of course, I’m not thinking about puritan audiences. I never am.”The scale of the short helped Almodovar feel as though he had cracked the code of what it takes for him to make English-language projects. “I can make a movie in English but it should be an intimate contemporary story so I can go and buy everything that I need for the set with minimal locations — three or four — and not use a lot of actors so I can have time to rehearse,” he said.When pressed, he revealed that he did indeed have new plans for another English-language project scheduled to shoot this year, though he was reticent to go into too much detail and jinx it. “I do have a script in English that’s almost finished,” he said. “It is a movie much like I described. It has three characters, it’s a contemporary story, it takes place in New York. There’s a lot of dialogue in the story. The actors talk a lot. It is more difficult in a sense as a film but it’s more accessible for me as a director.”He grinned. “I cannot say more about it,” he said, then added that he was writing another script set in Spain. “I’m working a lot, but this is the way I like to be,” he said. “I’m not complaining. I’m very happy.”“Strange Way of Life” premieres at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Sony Pictures Classics releases it in the U.S. this fall.",

        "content": "The summer movie season might be best known for its big-budget blockbusters and franchise sequels, but there’s a notable benefit for indie film lovers as well: the films that premiered at Sundance begin to open in theaters. The next few months will see several festival circuit hits open in arthouses, but few are more anticipated among cinephiles than “Earth Mama.”Savanah Leaf’s directorial debut, which follows a single mother struggling to navigate the welfare state with her third child on the way, was widely seen as the arrival of a bold new cinematic voice on the indie film circuit. A24 bought the project months before it even made its way to Sundance, and a new trailer is offering audiences a preview of what they have to look forward to this summer.“Earth Mama” is written and directed by Savanah Leaf. The cast includes Tia Nomore, Erika Alexander, Keta Price, Doechii, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Bokeem Woodbine, Kami Jones, Slim Yani, and Dominic Flike.The film’s official synopsis from A24 reads: “With two children in foster care, Gia, a pregnant single mother pitted against the system, fights to reclaim her family. In her close-knit Bay Area community, she works to make a life for herself and her kids, in this singular debut feature from filmmaker Savanah Leaf.”“Earth Mama” received overwhelmingly positive reviews after premiering at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival, with critics singling out the raw honesty that the Leaf was able to capture in her debut feature by casting newcomers in key roles.“Learn the names Savanah Leaf, first-time feature filmmaker, and Tia Nomore, first-time feature actress, right now, because their debut film “Earth Mama” is a shimmering stunner,” IndieWire’s Ryan Lattanzio wrote in his review of the film. “A former Olympic volleyball athlete, Leaf has a canny eye for locating the subversion and beauty within a welfare-system drama about a single mother fighting for her life and children. What sounds, on paper, like a challenging sit is actually a wondrous 97-minute feature, whose director and star are obviously poised for greatness.”A24 will release “Earth Mama” in theaters on Friday, July 7.

        "title": "‘Matilda’ Icon Mara Wilson Recalls Being ‘Sexualized’ as a Child Actor: ‘I Saw Things That I Couldn’t Unsee’",
        "content": "Mara Wilson had her doubts about being a child star.The “Mrs. Doubtfire” breakout actress, who went on to cement her status as a ’90s icon in “Matilda” and “Miracle on 34th Street,” opened up about the “sexualized” pressures of growing up in the spotlight.“I don’t think you can be a child star without there being some kind of lasting damage,” Wilson told The Guardian while promoting memoir “Good Girls Don’t,” adding, “People don’t realize how much constantly talking to the press as a child weighs on you.”Wilson began her career at age six. By seven years old, Wilson’s fame “kind of snowballed” and she began being asked by journalists if she knew what French kissing was or could pick out which fellow actor she found “sexiest.”“I had people sending me inappropriate letters and posting things about me online,” Wilson continued, citing that her photograph was posted on pornography websites superimposed onto adult women’s bodies. “I made the mistake of Googling myself when I was 12 and saw things that I couldn’t unsee.”She added, “The thing that people assume is that Hollywood is inherently corrupt, and there’s something about being on film sets that destroys you. For me, that was not necessarily true. I always felt safe on film sets. There were definitely some sketchy, questionable things that happened at times – adults that told dirty jokes, or sexually harassed people in front of me. People who did things like ask me if it was OK if I worked overtime, instead of asking my parents, but I never felt unsafe. I think that’s because I worked with a lot of really wonderful directors, who were used to working with children.”It was when Wilson hit puberty that Hollywood seemed to turn on her. By age 12, Wilson was asked by a director to wear a sports bra to hide her developing breasts; Wilson believed she was no longer “cute” and that the film industry was “kind of done” with her.“It affected me for a very long time because I had this Hollywood idea that if you’re not cute any more, if you’re not beautiful, then you are worthless. Because I directly tied that to the demise of my career,” Wilson said. “Even though I was sort of burned out on it, and Hollywood was burned out on me, it still doesn’t feel good to be rejected. For a long time, I had this kind of dysmorphia about the way that I looked and I obsessed about it too much.”One of Wilson’s final auditions led to Kristen Stewart being cast in a role, only fueling Wilson’s self-doubt further.“You think, ‘I’m ugly, I’m fat’ – and there were actual websites and newspapers and movie reviewers saying that about me,” Wilson recalled. “It got to the point where I became much more guarded, more anxious and depressed and cynical, and when you’re like that, it’s very hard to land a role, because in an audition, you have to be open and honest. It took a toll on me.”Wilson previously opened up about being fetishized by fans and admitting that she “felt sick” and “furious” seeing current child stars like “Stranger Things” actress Millie Bobby Brown endure similar abuse online.“What’s really at play here is the creepy, inappropriate public inclination to sexualize young girls in the media,” Wilson wrote in 2017, when Brown was 13 years old. “I am not a child anymore. Millie Bobby Brown is. Commenting on a child’s body, whether in a ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ way, in a sexualizing or pitying way, is still commenting on a child’s body.”",

        "content": "Timothée Chalamet is throwing it back to his Lil Timmy Tim days.The Oscar-nominated actor revealed his musical inspirations going into Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown,” which is set to start production this August. Elle Fanning co-stars. Chalamet has been attached to the James Mangold period piece since 2020 and will be performing Dylan’s songs onscreen.“I’ve been preparing for forever,” Chalamet told Vogue of working with a vocal coach every day.Yet Chalamet’s musical inclinations go back over a decade, with his viral Lil Timmy Tim rap performances and a special “Cabaret” production at his LaGuardia performing arts high school in New York City.“I can’t expect anyone outside of the New York City public school system to know this, but there is a production of ‘Cabaret’ at LaGuardia, class of 2013, that you can watch on YouTube,” Chalamet said, citing his performance as Emcee in the musical. “I remember the New York Times critic Ben Brantley saying very nice things about it, so I’m going to emphasize that.”The “Wonka” actor also infamously parodied Soundcloud rappers alongside Pete Davidson in a 2020 “Saturday Night Live” sketch. Chalamet is set to be collaborating with Martin Scorsese for a Chanel men’s fragrance ad and will star in “Dune: Part Two.”The “Call Me By Your Name” alum has been attached to the Dylan biopic since 2020. Originally titled “Going Electric,” the film was shelved amid the COVID-19 pandemic.“I haven’t stopped preparing, which has been one of the greatest gifts for me,” Chalamet said in 2022. “It’s been a wonderful experience getting to dive into that world, whether we get to make it or not. But without giving anything away — because I don’t want to beat anyone to the punch, and obviously things have to come together officially — the winds that are blowing are blowing in a very positive direction.”Chalamet revealed in a GQ cover story that he rented a home in Woodstock, New York, to prepare to embody Dylan. The “Call Me By Your Name” star also went to Dylan’s previous homes in New York City and read the memoir “Chronicles: Volume One,” plus met with “Inside Llewyn Davis” director Joel Coen for more insights on the 1960s folk scene.“A Complete Unknown” director Mangold confirmed in April 2023 that production was starting in August and will center on Dylan’s early career.“It’s such an amazing time in American culture and the story of a young, 19-year-old Bob Dylan coming to New York with like two dollars in his pocket and becoming a worldwide sensation within three years — first being embraced into the family of folk music in New York and then, of course, kind of outrunning them at a certain point as his star rises so beyond belief,” Mangold said. “It’s such an interesting true story and about such an interesting moment in the American scene.”",

        "title": "‘It Wasn’t Just a Case of Doing Cool Sh*t’: Why ‘The Mother’ Fight Scenes Smart",
        "content": "In Netflix‘s new thriller “The Mother,” Jennifer Lopez plays a military-trained assassin with a complicated criminal past who comes out of hiding to rescue the daughter she gave up years earlier. The premise is essentially a pretext for a series of impeccably staged action sequences that director Niki Caro mounts with the same exceptional precision and professionalism that characterizes Lopez’s shooter; while you may have seen this kind of revenge plot before in the “Taken” and “John Wick” movies (and, going back even further, in myriad Charles Bronson and Steven Seagal films from the ’80s and ’90s), you’ve never seen the gunplay and stunt driving filtered through Caro’s sensibility, and that makes all the difference.Caro cut her teeth on fight scenes with the elegant martial arts choreography of Disney’s “Mulan,” a film that she credits with giving her the confidence to handle large-scale action. For “The Mother,” however, she wanted something different. “With this one, I just felt like it was gloves off,” she told IndieWire. “I wanted every sequence to feel fresh and different from the next one, and to have an urgency that comes with being by her side the whole time.” For Caro, this meant finding the connection between the emotions Lopez’s heroine was experiencing and the external carnage. “It wasn’t just a case of doing cool shit, though cool shit is fun and I enjoy it as an audience member. The storytelling has to have the same emotional logic you would find in any dramatic scene — you can still apply those same rules to action.”The character-driven action in Andrea Berloff, Peter Craig, and Misha Green’s script starts at a high pitch and keeps raising the stakes for a solid two hours without letting up. Caro had a number of guiding principles for keeping “The Mother” audience connected to Lopez, most of which had to do with presenting the action in as realistic and immediate a manner as possible. “First of all, the action is predominantly in camera,” she said, “and generally the movie is shot on location.” The locations — particularly the film’s riveting climax in the snowy wilderness of Smithers, British Columbia — give “The Mother” not only a dynamic visual context for the action but generated brutal shooting conditions that informed Lopez’s steely performance. The locations also provided inspiration for Caro’s staging, as the chase sequences grew organically out of location scouts in spots like the Spanish island of Gran Canaria, which doubled for Cuba.Moving from location to location, Caro was insistent on evolving the visual language of the film to tell the story. “There were so many action sequences, and I wanted them to keep unfolding in different places without ever repeating the same ideas,” she said. “Everything [The Mother] did was driven by the emotional logic of protecting her child, and her keen, precise intelligence.” One key way that Caro puts the audience in Lopez’s shoes is by acclimating the viewer to the geography of each location; just as The Mother surveys each area before she positions herself to take on her adversaries, Caro lays out the spatial relationships so that the audience is never confused, no matter how fast and chaotic the gunplay becomes.“I spend a lot of time strategizing on that, doing some of the storyboards myself but also working with amazing stunt coordinators and second unit directors.” By letting The Mother’s point of view dictate the shot selection and how the action is presented, Caro was able to create a visceral experience for the audience and an economical one for herself. “We were on a tight schedule, so we had to be disciplined to get the story told,” she said. “They’re all used. It was pretty tightly choreographed. With the final sequence, there weren’t many shots that aren’t in the sequence.”",

        "title": "Thierry Fremaux Calls Adèle Haenel’s ‘Festival for Rapists’ Comments About Cannes ‘False,’ Alleges ‘Crazy Dissonance’",
        "content": "Cannes festival director Thierry Fremaux is responding to French actress Adèle Haenel’s claims that the annual festival has supported “sexual aggressors” like director Roman Polanski and actor Gerard Depardieu.Haenel, who publicly announced her retirement from acting in March 2022, penned an open letter last week slamming the Cannes Film Festival for protecting sexual abusers. “They join hands [to protect] the [Gerard] Depardieus, the [Roman] Polanskis, the [Dominique] Boutonnats,” Haenel wrote. “It bothers them that the victims make too much noise. They preferred that we disappear and die in silence.”She added that Cannes was “ready to do anything to defend their rapist chiefs” and claimed that the French industry effectively “canceled” its own #MeToo movement.Now, Cannes festival director Fremaux defended the festival from Haenel’s “radical” and “false” comments.“She’s very radical, but it’s an erroneous comment,” Fremaux said. “It’s misplaced. She didn’t think that when she came to Cannes unless she suffered from a crazy dissonance. Now she’s speaking in this vein.”Fremaux continued, “People use the Cannes Film Festival to talk about world problems. I think it’s fine…but you wouldn’t be here complaining that you can’t get tickets if you thought we were all rapists.”The 2023 Cannes Film Festival sparked controversy after “Jeanne du Barry” starring Johnny Depp was selected as the Opening Night feature. Writer/director/star Maïwenn was accused of assaulting a French journalist; she recently confirmed the allegations.“I don’t know about the image of Johnny Depp in the U.S.,” Fremaux said. “To tell you the truth, in my life, I only have one rule, it’s the freedom of thinking, and the freedom of speech and acting within a legal framework.”Fremaux also addressed not including Woody Allen’s “Coup de Chance” or Roman Polanski’s “The Palace” in a previous interview.“The Polanski, we have not seen it. Woody Allen is a bit special, I saw it without seeing it,” Fremaux said in an interview as translated by IndieWire. “The film was not a candidate. We also know that if his film is shown at Cannes, the controversy would take over against his film, against the other films.”Allen’s last film to screen at Cannes was 2016’s “Café Society.” Polanski debuted “Based on a True Story” at 2017 Cannes.“Portrait of a Lady on Fire” actress Haenel walked out of the 2020 César Awards when Polanski was awarded the best director prize for “An Officer and a Spy”; that same year, she accused French director Christophe Ruggia of sexually assaulting her when she was 12 years old on the set of “The Devils.” Ruggia denied the 2020 charges and has yet to face trial after being formally indicted.",

        "title": "Cannes Celebration of Movies Doesn’t Ignore Cinema Crisis: ‘A Future Whose Contours Are Unknown’",
        "content": "At a press conference the day before the start of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, artistic director Thierry Fremaux defended Johnny Depp, warded off complaints about the digital ticketing system, and declined to comment on Woody Allen. Again and again, he redirected the conversation to the movies.“So you’re not really asking about the cinema?” he responded to one journalist. “I won’t talk about films that aren’t here,” he said later.Fremaux has a history of deflection when it comes to the delicate navigation of cultural and political subjects at the center of the world’s most prominent film festival; a wrong word can set off a media firestorm and this year many distractions loom.There’s Depp, who appears for a few minutes in opening selection “Jeanne du Barry” (“I’m interested in Johnny Depp as an actor,” Fremaux said) and has a directing vehicle at the market; the looming WGA strike, which prohibits American writers at the festival from promoting their work (“We’re not very well informed about what’s happening”), and another possible strike from the French electrician’s union that could literally threaten the festival’s ability to keep the lights on (Fremaux pointed out that Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne will meet this week with the trade union, and “we have nothing but positive dialogue” with them).He also addressed a recent open letter from “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” star Adele Haenel, in which she criticized the festival for supporting the work of Gerard Depardieu, Roman Polanski, and others. “They’re ready to do anything to defend their rapist chiefs,” she wrote.“She’s very radical, but it’s an erroneous comment,” Fremaux said. “It’s misplaced. She didn’t think that when she came to Cannes unless she suffered from a crazy dissonance. Now she’s speaking in this vein. People use the Cannes Film Festival to talk about world problems. I think it’s fine… but you wouldn’t be here complaining that you can’t get tickets if you thought we were all rapists.”Fremaux acknowledged that the spotlight on Cannes leads to wider discussions, but resisted giving them equal weight. “It’s a major event that has to express certain issues,” he said. “Above all, we are here to express the state of current cinema.”On that subject, another kind of drama stands out. Three years out from the pandemic that canceled the 2020 edition, box office for arthouse movies around the world continues to struggle, and skepticism mounts about future prospects. Even as Cannes emphasizes the power of the big-screen experience, it’s a difficult business model for all but a handful of name directors and the biggest commercial releases. Cannes has a few of those (“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” premieres this year, a year after “Top Gun: Maverick” took off; so does Wes Anderson’s “Asteroid City”) but its Official Selection is dominated by work that may not find an easy path after the festival.“I have no concerns about that,” Fremaux told IndieWire in a separate interview ahead of the press conference. “The big screen has kept all its magic. It is even more important than before.”Fremaux noted that the festival turned away 10,000 applications for industry accreditations this year (but didn’t reduce the number of press). The programming team watched 2,000 films for its lineup of roughly 70 features (more may be added on the fly). Many of the 21 films in competition hail from filmmakers who have been acclaimed for decades, raising questions about whether newer generations are delivering sufficient work that could crack the race for the Palme d’Or.This year’s competition features previous winners like Ken Loach (“The Old Oak”) and Nuri Bilge Ceylan (“About Dry Gasses”), but only one directorial debut (Ramata Toulaye-Sy’s “Banel and Adama”). Fremaux insisted that Cannes had to strike a balance between acknowledging newcomers and supporting the old guard. “This is all the more important since the cinema must face a future whose contours are unknown,” he said. “Later, we will recall young filmmakers discovered in 2023, but also that this year there was Martin Scorsese.”Fremaux programmed Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon” out of competition at the behest of Apple, which reportedly wanted to avoid the pressure of an awards race this early in its lifecycle (it opens theatrically this fall). The Cannes programmer praised Apple for partnering with Paramount to give the movie a wide release — both in the U.S. and France. “Apple will become a big voice in cinema,” he said. “It basically already is.”That statement strikes a contrast to the festival’s relationship with Netflix, which remains banned from the competition unless it agrees to adhere to France’s 15-month theatrical window. Even there, Cannes exerted some influence; conversations around the streamer at the festival impacted broader discussion of the streamer’s presence in France. Last year, Netflix made a deal with the French cinema guilds to invest at least $45 million in at least 10 French or European films over the next three years. Among the first of these is “Jeanne du Barry,” and while Netflix doesn’t have distribution rights it has a de facto presence on opening night. “This is a virtuous rule,” Fremaux told IndieWire. “Netflix is welcome in French cinema.”As for other American studios, Fremaux managed to attract Disney not only with “Indiana Jones” but also the Pixar-produced closing night entry “Elemental.”“I would have dreamed of being able to present ‘Oppenheimer,’ ‘Poor Things,’ or ‘Barbie,’” he said, citing the latest anticipated works from Christopher Nolan, Yorgos Lanthimos, and Greta Gerwig. “That was not possible due to timing issues. They are three immense filmmakers. American cinema is so rich that the suitors are numerous.”At the other end of the spectrum, Cannes seems more invested in attempting to address distribution concerns across the festival. The autonomous Directors’ Fortnight sidebar (aka the Quinzaine), which artistic director Julien Rejl takes over this year, previously allowed Netflix films to play at the festival under Rejl’s predecessor, Paolo Moretti. Now, the policy is identical to the one for official selection requiring a French release.“These filmmakers feel that films are meant to be seen on the big screen at first,” Rejl said in an interview with IndieWire. “The question could be, ‘Why does a streaming service need a big screen in Cannes, if the film is then going to be broadcast on a small screen?’ It doesn’t make sense.”Rejl enters the revolving door of the Fortnight leadership (he’s the fifth person to hold the perch in 15 years) with a background in sales and distribution at the French film company Capricci. That gives him an added perspective on the challenges facing the riskier — and mostly lower-profile — selections at Fortnight this year. For the first time, the entire 19-film program culled from 4,000 submissions will screen at 30 cities around France for one week after the festival. The festival has also offered to provide an advertising campaign, trailer, and poster for each film to help them present themselves to potential buyers.“I felt if I wasn’t the one to coordinate and organize the promotion of those films myself maybe it would be hard to find audiences for them,” he said. “That’s why we launched this June event.”The highest-profile selection in Rejl’s program is Michel Gondry “The Book of Solutions,” but much of the lineup is edgier with less obvious selling points, from Sean Price Williams’ anarchic American road trip saga “The Sweet East” to “The Feeling That the Time For Doing Something Has Passed,” a deadpan BDSM comedy from New York filmmaker Joanna Arnow.Rejl said he avoided films that seemed as though they might accept Fortnight as a consolation prize if the official selection rejected them. “I don’t want the Quinzaine to be seen as second best,” he said. “Maybe if a film aims for official selection and doesn’t get in, then it should go to Venice.” While every competition film at Cannes faces overblown expectations, Rejl tempered the ones for his own selection. “I’m not looking for perfection,” he said. “I want to see people showing things that have never been seen.”Down the road at Critics Week, the other autonomous Cannes section focused on first-timers, artistic director Ava Cahen hit a similar note. “To discover new auteurs is a rare chance to enrich this history of cinema with new voices, new names, new perspectives,” she said, noting the success last year of Charlotte Wells’ debut “Aftersun” in the section, where it was acquired by A24 and went on to score Paul Mescal an Oscar nomination. “It is more important than ever to encourage auteur cinema and emerging filmmakers,” she said, “but also bold producers and distributors, as well as courageous sales agents and film programmers, and to trigger the curiosity of audiences.”In lockstep with the rest of the festival, the seven-movie Critics Week competition also requires a theatrical release in France. “I will always stand on the side of movie theaters, because it was in theaters that I learned to love cinema,” Cahen said. “It is in the cinema that we cultivate our own curiosity, it is in the cinema that we dream big. But we also know that platforms are very efficient at spreading new talents and they have always been very interested in our exploratory work.”Selections from Critics Week will also travel beyond the festival to play at film events in Marseille, Corsica, Morelia, Martinique, and — naturally — Paris. The lineup ranges from satiric sci-fi (“Tiger Stripes”) to Korean horror-comedy (“Sleep”), and collectively they strike a significant contrast to the veterans dominating competition this year. “I think that the younger generation has a lot to teach us,” said Cahen, who is 37. “They prove that cinema is not dead at all. The whole history of cinema is made of this balance between established and emerging directors.”Fremaux echoed. “It’s a beautiful coincidence to see this mix of generations, between the masters and tomorrow’s auteurs,” he told IndieWire. At the press conference, he returned to that point. “People may say that in 2023 you had this dialogue between generations,” he said. “The cinema holds its future in its own hands.”",

        "content": "Hollywood was quick to credit Tom Cruise with saving the film industry in 2022 after the success of “Top Gun: Maverick.” But the actor was trying to carry the weight of the business on his shoulders long before “Maverick” flew into theaters.In 2020, Cruise’s upcoming blockbuster “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part I” was the first major Hollywood film to resume production during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The on-set safety protocols that producers developed provided a model for the rest of the industry to return to work soon after. But Cruise quickly went viral when a video leaked of him berating crew members for standing too close together.“You can tell it to the people who are losing their fucking homes because our industry is shut down,” Cruise was heard telling the employees who were seen breaking protocol. “It’s not going to put food on their table or pay for their college education. That’s what I sleep with every night – the future of this fucking industry! So I’m sorry, I am beyond your apologies. I have told you, and now I want it, and if you don’t do it, you’re out. We are not shutting this fucking movie down! Is it understood? If I see it again, you’re fucking gone.”While many were initially shocked to hear Cruise speaking so candidly, much of Hollywood eventually praised the actor for his commitment to safety. And now that the finished film is just months away from finally hitting theaters, the crew is able to reflect on the incident with the benefit of hindsight. In a new interview with Entertainment Weekly, director Christopher McQuarrie recalled the complicated emotions that went into Cruise’s outburst.“That all took place during a very complicated and a very uncertain time,” McQuarrie said. “Obviously, we’re grateful that people took it the way that it was intended. We were fighting to keep the industry alive, we were fighting to keep people employed, we were fighting for the studio, we were fighting for cinemas, and we still are. We’re still there doing that. I’m just glad people understood the intention behind it.”“Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part I” opens in theaters on Wednesday, July 12.",

        "content": "The search for a new actor to replace Daniel Craig as James Bond is officially underway — and Tom Hanks has some thoughts.In a new interview with the BBC, Hanks made it clear that he thinks Idris Elba should be the next actor to take up the 007 mantle.“Understand this,” Hanks said. “James Bond has a licence to kill. I would issue that licence to Idris Elba just based on the work that I’ve seen him do.”Hanks’ opinion places him in agreement with actors like Pierce Brosnan and countless fans who have endorsed Elba for the role. At this point, the only person who might disagree with the fan casting is Elba himself. After being linked to the role for over a decade, the actor recently denied having any serious interest in the gig.“It is not a goal for my career,” Elba said. “I don’t think that, you know, playing Bond will satisfy some of my personal goals. It will definitely satisfy the will of a nation. I’m not gonna lie, every corner of the world I go, and I’m talking about different cultures, they always go ‘Bond,’ and I feel it is beyond me at this junction. It’s beyond me. You know, it’s not a question of, should I, do I, will I. It is what the will of the nation dictates sometimes.”Still, Elba is likely to be the subject of endless speculation until a new James Bond is officially announced. Longtime franchise producer Michael G. Wilson recently said that, while a new film is at least two years away, the casting search has begun. He specified that the casting team is avoiding younger actors in favor of more seasoned choices.“We’ve tried looking at younger people in the past,” Wilson said. “But trying to visualize it doesn’t work. Remember, Bond’s already a veteran. He’s had some experience. He’s a person who has been through the wars, so to speak. He’s probably been in the SAS or something. He isn’t some kid out of high school that you can bring in and start off. That’s why it works for a 30-something.”",

        "content": "One of the best things about a new Wes Anderson movie is seeing the auteur’s stable of regular collaborators gradually expand. While he generally brings a few new A-listers into the fold on each project — for instance, “Asteroid City” marks his first time working with Margot Robbie and Tom Hanks — Anderson tends to collaborate with his favorite actors over and over again.Actors are generally eager to re-team with Anderson, which might explain how he is able to consistently assemble star-studded casts on relatively low budgets. Scarlett Johansson, for example, was so happy to work with him again that she showed up on the “Asteroid City” set just eight weeks after her son was born in 2021.In a new interview with Entertainment Weekly, Johansson explained that she didn’t expect to return to work so soon after giving birth. But she had already put so much preparation into the role that she opted to make it work rather than force Anderson to find a last minute replacement. To help her navigate Anderson’s demanding shoot with a new baby at home, she turned to an unlikely source for help: her co-star Jason Schwartzman.“Jason was so helpful,” Johansson said. “It was just so quick, and also I had a little baby, so there was a lot going on. My brain was mostly functioning, but he would help me run lines at any moment. He was constantly present and supportive, and I needed him very much. I would say ‘Please don’t go too far away from me.’ I was trying to stay alert, but he was just great. We work very similarly.”Johansson’s admiration for Schwartzman extends far beyond the help he provided her on set. She also praised the “Rushmore” star’s acting abilities and the subtle details that he added to his role in “Asteroid City.”“His nuance and his ability to be playful with the dialogue is just great,” she said. “He can underplay things so well, and he’s very precise. I mean, all of the actors in the cast are really strong and a lot of them have theatrical backgrounds too. I wonder if it’s something that Wes searches out, knowingly or unknowingly, because it’s like he’s made his own theater troupe.” “Asteroid City” will premiere in competition at the Cannes Film Festival before opening in U.S. theaters on June 16.",

        "title": "‘Passages’ Teaser: A Brutal Love Triangle Unfolds in Ira Sachs’ Sundance Hit",
        "content": "With the Cannes Film Festival kicking off next weekend, all eyes in the indie film world are currently on the Croisette. But while most of the buzzy Cannes premieres won’t be making their way stateside for several months, we’re finally approaching the window where breakouts from Sundance begin to open in theaters.One such hit is “Passages,” Ira Sachs‘ haunting eighth feature about a filmmaker who abandons his husband for a woman he meets in Paris. The film, which stars Frank Rogowski, Ben Whishaw, and Adèle Exarchopoulos, was praised by many as a throwback to the kinds of intense character studies that Mike Nichols cut his teeth on in the 1960s and ’70s.The film earned strong reviews at Sundance, with IndieWire’s David Ehrlich writing, “A signature new drama from a director whose best work (‘Keep the Lights On,’ ‘Love Is Strange’) is at once both generously tender in its brutality and unsparingly brutal in its tenderness, the raw and resonant ‘Passages’ is the kind of fuck around and find out love triangle that rings true because we aspire to its sexier moments but see ourselves in its most selfish ones.”In an interview with IndieWire conducted at Sundance, Rognowski, Whishaw, and Exarchopoulos praised Sachs for crafting such a messy relationship drama filled with so much human emotion.“Being a human being that loves and desires and is full of fear and hope and spontaneous decision, it felt rather easy,” Rogowski said. “It’s not just about this character being hard to understand. It’s also very funny how it’s combined sometimes, it’s also very ridiculous. Love, sometimes, is ridiculous and painful, but also, it always comes back to very human and intimate moments that allow you to accept the more challenging ones.”“I actually think [Franz Rogowski’s character] is extremely relatable. It’s not extreme what he does. It’s just that Ira shows it. People do this all the time. They say one thing, they do another, they change their minds about something. We all do it all the time, I do it anyway. I find the erraticness and mercurial… I think that’s very human,” Whishaw added. “[Ira] doesn’t tidy it up, make it nicer.”“Passages” opens in select U.S. theaters on Friday, August 4. Watch the teaser below.",

        "title": "Christopher Nolan Used Actual Scientists as Extras in ‘Oppenheimer’",
        "content": "It’s been three years since a new Christopher Nolan movie opened in theaters, but the director’s fans won’t have to wait much longer to see his latest work. “Oppenheimer” has become one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 thanks to its star-studded cast and Nolan’s proven track record with WWII subject matter (see: “Dunkirk”).The Cillian Murphy-led biopic about atomic bomb inventor Robert Oppenheimer is the smallest Nolan movie in years in terms of budget and scale. But it just wouldn’t be a Christopher Nolan project without a few anecdotes about the director’s obsessive attention to detail and commitment to spectacle. In a new interview with Entertainment Weekly, Nolan and Murphy spoke about the meticulous effort that the entire cast put in to ensure that each scene was accurate.“Every day, you had these phenomenal actors, who are heroes of mine, coming in,” Murphy said. “Every day, you were having to raise your game to work with these legends. Everybody was so unbelievably well-prepared. Every single actor, no matter what size their role or the significance of their character in history, each one of them had this massive depth of knowledge that they could draw on.”Nolan explained that even the films extras were well-versed in the source material — which was rather easy for them, because he made a point to cast actual scientists as background actors.“We were in the real Los Alamos and we had a lot of real scientists as extras,” Nolan said. “We needed the crowd of extras to give reactions, and improvise, and we were getting sort of impromptu, very educated speeches. It was really fun to listen to. You’ve been on sets where you’ve got a lot of extras around and they’re more or less thinking about lunch. These guys were thinking about the geopolitical implications of nuclear arms and knew a lot about it. It actually was a great reminder every day of: We have to be really on our game, we have to be faithful to the history here, and really know what we’re up to.”Universal Pictures will release “Oppenheimer” in theaters on Friday, July 21.",

        "title": "Magnolia Pictures, No Longer for Sale, Finds Opportunity in Hard Times",
        "content": "Kohn’s Corner is a weekly column about the challenges and opportunities of sustaining American film culture.Every year around this time, I relish the opportunity to vanish into a bubble of Cannes hype and pretend that world-class auteurs dominate the movie business on a global scale. But for the moment, I’ll take a breather from the laughing gas and acknowledge it’s a rough moment for the specialty distribution business — especially in America. A lot of those promising Cannes titles won’t follow me home.Few movies that aren’t in English succeed at our box office. Most get lost in the streaming vortex, if they’re lucky to land there at all. Arthouses nationwide continue to face audience decline. Prestige Oscar movies don’t guarantee strong returns. A24’s winning streak faltered with the flop of its most-costly production, “Beau is Afraid,” suggesting that even its adoring audiences have zero interest in daring, original work. Mainstays like IFC Films have been forced to reasses their agenda due to a shifting market and fickle corporate demands. As I wrote in this column last month, the great indie contraction has landed.That’s why I’m very happy to break some news of a perennial distribution entity revving its engines for Cannes and beyond.A little over a year and a half ago, reports circulated that Mark Cuban and Todd Wagner were looking to sell Magnolia Pictures just in time for its 20th anniversary. Now, sources tell me that Cuban and Wagner have reversed course. After exploring a few options, the company behind revered 21st century arthouse hits like “Jiro Dreams of Sushi,” “Let the Right One In,” and “Melancholia” has taken itself off the market and doubled down on its ambitions. Longtime executive Dori Begley has been elevated to co-CEO alongside Eamonn Bowles.Begley has climbed the ranks of Magnolia’s quirky and ever-evolving business model since she was hired as director of acquisitions 16 years ago. Her promotion puts homegrown talent in charge of the company’s future alongside a stalwart veteran of the ’90s indie boom.I heard murmurings of these changes at this week’s lively BAM gala, which counted Spike Lee among its honorees; Magnolia was one of a handful of film benefactors at the event, alongside A24 and Cinetic. When I reached out to a company representative, he confirmed that the company was no longer for sale.“For over 21 years under Eamonn’s leadership, Magnolia has been expert at steady growth while navigating an unpredictable market, and for the last 16 years, Dori’s acumen has been instrumental in that,” said Wagner in a statement provided to IndieWire. Mark and I couldn’t hope for a better team to steward the company through this next exciting chapter.”In his own (characteristically playful) statement, Bowles — who moonlights as the frontman for rock ‘n’ roll band The Martinets — added: “I couldn’t think of a better person to co-head Magnolia Pictures with than Dori. Her intelligence, integrity, energy and grace, not to mention some of the most impressive hair in the industry, make her supremely qualified to help grow the company to greater heights. We’re excited for what comes next.”“In true Magnolia form, we see the uncertainty and fluctuation of this moment as an opportunity to evolve and grow the business,” Begley wrote me in statement. “I have tremendous respect for the lifelong integrity and dexterity of this company, and couldn’t be more proud to help guide us through the next phase in partnership with Eamonn, the rock solid foundation of Magnolia, and one of specialized film’s greatest champions.”This is good stuff happening to good people, but some may wonder what that future looks like for a company that hasn’t delivered a major hit in quite some time. Magnolia released the searing Romanian documentary “Collective,” which earned Best Documentary and Best International Feature Film nominations at the 2021 Oscars, but you’d have to go back even earlier to the likes of 2018’s “RGB” and 2017’s “I Am Not Your Negro” to find anything that garnered a measure of commercial success. Its last serious box-office draw was Palme d’Or winner and Japanese Oscar nominee “Shoplifters,” which grossed $3.3 million in 2019.That reading would assume that the arthouse business is solely defined by box office and awards, but over the last two decades Magnolia accrued an impressive catalogue of provocative and acclaimed films. It includes revered documentaries like “Jiro,” “Man on Wire,” and “Capturing the Friedmans” as well as first-rate genre work like Bong Joon-ho’s “Mother” and “The Host.” All told, Magnolia has over 600 films in its library — less than the voluminous offerings some overeager buyers accrued in recent years, but impressive considering the emphasis on quality. A representative from the company told me that the last three years (aka the COVID ones) have been among the most profitable in its history.Libraries are key in the monetization game. All streamers pay licensing fees to fend off the constant subscriber churn, and Magnolia’s eclectic curatorial approach pays off in bits and pieces thanks to the consistency of its aesthetic standards. It won’t have the insane valuation that led Amazon to pay $8.8 billion for MGM, but what does? (And that deal has yet to justify itself for Amazon.)Another boost for Magnolia this week came via Disney’s second-quarter earnings report. As I wrote last year, Disney has become one of the specialty world’s biggest benefactors thanks to lucrative output deals that Hulu maintains with several buyers in addition to its in-house Searchlight. On the Disney earnings call this week, CEO Bob Iger revealed that Hulu would get its own tile on Disney+ in the U.S., instantly amplifying the potential audience for movies that appear there. (That’s also the first step in its path toward buying out Comcast’s stake in Hulu worldwide.) While these output deals can be fickle (sorry, black-and-white movies!), they provide serious financial leverage for companies looking to make competitive offers.Now, Magnolia heads to Cannes alongside with renewed confidence in its position within the streaming ecosystem. There are a handful of big acquisition targets in the Cannes official selection thanks to Todd Haynes’ “May December” and the Jude Law/Alicia Vikander thriller “Firebrand,” along with juicy genre offerings like Takeshi Kitano’s gay samurai epic “Kubi” and intriguing new work from some of the best European directors of the past the 40 years, including Aki Kaurismaki (“Fallen Leaves”) and Ken Loach (“The Old Oak”). So who knows? Maybe a few of highlights will follow me home after all.This is a funky time for the content business, but there’s a promising contrast in smaller companies with rarefied strategies. The Magnolia situation suggests opportunity for any company with a solid library, good taste, and a steady habit of ingesting new work. Other film entities exploring sales might consider the alternative to chasing a huge deal: Batten down the hatches, make the most of what you have, and keep building it out for whatever the unpredictable future might bring.As usual, I welcome feedback to this week’s column: eric@indiewire.comBrowse earlier installments here.",

        "title": "The Muppet Movies Ranked, from ‘The Great Muppet Caper’ to ‘Muppets Take Manhattan’",
        "content": "Every few months, it seems someone from Hollywood says the same thing: There are no true movie stars anymore. Blockbusters are now carried by brands and franchises, and the days of actors being able to sell a movie on their marketability alone have long since passed. How did this happen? There are a variety of possible reasons, but we’ll propose just one: movies just don’t have The Muppets in them anymore.It has been almost 10 years since Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Scooter, and their various crafted cohorts graced theater screens in “Muppets Most Wanted,” which saw the acclaimed comedy group stage a prison break. Since then, the beloved creations of Jim Henson have been confined to the small screen, where they captured the hearts and minds of audiences everywhere via a strong candidate for the most influential sketch comedy series of all time: 1976-1981’s “The Muppet Show.”While it’s nice to have legendary A-list stars on television, Disney (which has owned the Muppets brand since 2004) has struggled to give Kermit and his collaborators the platform they deserve. Their titular ABC docuseries lasted only a single season in 2015, while a modernized Disney+ variety series “Muppets Now” similarly flamed out after one outing in 2020.This week brings another Disney+ program from the group: “The Muppets Mayhem,” which hopefully will be able to find the audience previous efforts could not. But even then the core group isn’t involved on camera for the first season. The series instead focuses on longtime backing band The Electric Mayhem, consisting of breakout star Animal, frontman Dr. Teeth, Floyd Pepper, Janice, Zoot, and Lips. All six are deserving stars in their own right, but we think it’s safe to say the world still hungers to see Miss Piggy’s karate chop; to bask in Kermit’s warm folksy froggy green glow; to witness the legendary chemistry between America’s sweethearts Gonzo the Great and Camilla the Chicken.Maybe the issue is that the Muppets are too big to be confined to TV, as great as their original show was. Since making the leap to the big screen with 1979’s “The Muppet Movie,” Kermit and friends have essentially created their own genre of films, ones only they can make. The eight films bearing the group’s name span genres — from heist films to space operas, from Christmas films to pirate adventures — but all share the hallmarks that make the Muppets the Muppets: catchy musical numbers, celebrity cameos, big boundless comedy, and a sweetness that never tips over into saccharine territory. It’s a filmography as varied as it is strong, which makes ranking them a daunting proposition: pitting a crop of films where every single one is somebody’s childhood favorite against each other.A quick note on methodology for this story: the list only focuses on the theatrical films that carry the Muppet name, disregarding some television and direct-to-DVD releases. In addition to the ranking, we also included notes about what the human actors who made appearances in the films had to say about their experiences, which range from heartwarming memories on set from acclaimed thespians to bitter feuds and scandalous gossip.Here are the eight theatrically released Muppets movies, ranked.The indisputable black sheep of the Muppet films, “Muppets From Space” is notorious for keeping the franchise out of cinemas for years, failing to break even at the box office and essentially killing off the franchise. And while the movie isn’t terrible by any means, it’s overall a far more uneven affair than the very best the franchise has given us. The movie follows Gonzo as he attempts to discover his origins, and becomes convinced that he’s an alien of some kind. As he attempts to track down his family, he gets captured by the U.S. government, forcing Kermit and friends to save him.While Gonzo’s overall arc of realizing the Muppets are his true home is undeniably sweet, the movie suffers from saggy pacing, with an entire arc about Miss Piggy attempting to establish a career as a TV reporter that goes nowhere. Plus, it lacks musical numbers of any kind, making it feel all the more divorced from the rest of the Muppet films. Men on Muppets: Miss Piggy has established herself as one of the messiest stars in cinema’s history, and her exploits on the sets of Muppet movies are the stuff of legend. In “Muppets From Space,” she worked with the beloved late Ray Liotta, who years later said to Rolling Stone,“She’s a bitch.” But Liotta admitted that the porky princess was “the only actress I slept with” over the course of his career.  “The Muppets Take Manhattan” is a victim of not living up to what came before it. After two great films, the third movie features a bit of a creative shakeup; Frank Oz takes over as director from Jim Henson, while Jerry Juhl is replaced as screenwriter by Oz, Tom Patchett, and Jay Tarses. The resulting film is, compared to most children’s movies, great: it’s a fun showbiz romp that follows the crew as they attempt to put on their musical “Manhattan Melodies” together after Kermit gets into an accident that leaves him amnesiac and lost. There are some great songs like “Together Again,” and the film’s fantasy sequence of the cast as babies directly lead to the popular “Muppet Babies” cartoon. But it’s considerably more muted than the prior films, with less laughs and less highlights all around. Men on Muppets: During production of “Muppets Take Manhattan,” Miss Piggy worked with comedian Joan Rivers, one of the human cameos in the film. The two were friends in the ’70s, but developed a rift after Piggy beat out Rivers in her audition for “The Muppet Show.” Sadly, working together on the project didn’t heal what became one of showbizz’s single ugliest feuds, culiminating in a highly publicized physical altercation on a red carpet in 2014. This simply named film acts as a reintroduction to the beloved stars, in their first theatrical venture in 12 years. The result is an oddly emotional story about Walter, a fan of the Muppets, who teams up with his brother Gary (Jason Segel, who wrote the script with Nicholas Stoller) to reunite the long disbanded group and save their old theater from being torn down. Seeing the Muppets confront their worries about being irrelevant and forgotten is touching and sad, as is the fractured relationship between Kermit and Miss Piggy, which makes the big “Muppet Show” revival sequence at the end incredibly satisfying. That said, the film loses the classic characters a bit, focusing too much on Gary and Walter for much of its runtime — although the epic Oscar-winning song “Man or Muppet” almost makes up for it. Men on Muppets: The Muppets’ film comeback saw them working with one of their most outspoken fans in Hollywood, as Segel was a longtime devotee of the comedy troupe. In an NPR interview for the film, he called working with the group a “dream come true,” and discussed how their work impacted him as a child. “The Muppets don’t get laughs at other people’s expense. It’s part of what I really loved about the Muppets. They don’t even want to destroy their villains. They want to reform their villains,” Segel said. “The Muppets are pure.”There have only been two times where the Muppets took on the task of adapting classic stories from literature, but both are so undeniably fun it’s hard not to wonder if all of humanity’s greatest stories need to be retold with Kermit and Piggy in the cast. A gleefully funny adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson’s classic pirate novel, “Muppet Treasure Island” has the Muppets take the roles of the sailors on the ship Hispaniola, as they set sail looking for a secret treasure while contending with the dastardly Long John Silver (Tim Curry, having the time of his life even by “Rocky Horror” standards). It’s a loose and fun riff on pirate films, with Gonzo and Rizzo acting as meta commentators. Plus, there’s wildly outsized musical numbers like “Cabin Fever,” and some genuinely rousing action to tie the story together. Men on Muppets: Curry was utterly delicious in “Muppet Treasure Island,” and he would later recall working with the Muppets as one of the best experiences of his career: “It was one of the happiest sets I’ve ever been on. There’s a conspicuous lack of ego among the Muppets’.Although it sadly didn’t attract the audience “The Muppets” did, “Muppets Most Wanted” is a massively improved outing from that reboot: putting the focus firmly on Kermit as he gets replaced by his dopleganger — criminal mastermind Constantine — and thrown into a German Gulag. It’s a clear spiritual successor to “The Great Muppet Caper,” with a wackier tone and mile-a-minute jokes. And though it doesn’t quite measure up to that film’s strengths, it feels like a genuine update of what makes the Muppets work for the modern day. Plus, it gave us the evil Kermit meme, which no other film on this list can claim but all of fandom is better for.Men on Muppets: By 2014, the Muppets had proven themselves legends and universally beloved figures in their field. So it’s no surprise that the humans playing the bit parts in “Most Wanted” spoke about worshiping the ground the A-listers walk on. “He’s the biggest star I will ever work with, certainly,” Tina Fey recalled about Kermit. “You see him in a press conference, and people are just psyched that he’s there. You just have to play it cool. You have to act like you belong there with Kermit. Fake it till you make it.”After their cinematic debut, The Muppets went off the walls for their followup. “The Great Muppet Caper” is pretty much nonstop silliness, with the cast breaking character and the fourth wall left and right; Kermit and Fozzie playing identical twin brothers; and a convulted adventure in London to track down a jewel robber that’s essentially an excuse for a new joke every three seconds. While the wackier tone means the film lacks a bit of the classic Muppet heart, if you want a Muppet movie that will make you laugh, this is the one to watch. Plus, the film looks gorgeous, with massively increased production value compared to the original. Men on Muppets: By far the most dramatic story in the entire existence of the Muppets is the steamy affair behind the scenes of “The Great Muppet Caper”: a sordid romance between Miss Piggy and Charles Grodin, who plays the lead villain Nicky. The sparks between Grodin and Piggy on screen were very much there off camera, although neither confirmed the details of their brief relationship for 30 years, before Grodin finally went public via an explosive Vulture oral history. An extremely faithful adaptation of Charles Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol” that just so happens to feature the Muppets in supporting roles, “The Muppet Christmas Carol” is undoubtably the darkest film in the franchise. Featuring Michael Caine as Scrooge, in a performance that’s among his very best, the movie plays Dickens’ original story of greed, regret, and second chances almost entirely straight, with dialogue from the original novella mostly intact and entire passages of narration spoken by Gonzo as Dickens himself. The result is a film that’s a bit of an outlier from other Muppet films, focusing more on Caine than the central group and often focusing on drama over comedy. But it works wonders; the new Muppets that play the ghosts are terrifying and unforgettable; the cast slots in well as the aggreived townspeople around Scrooge; and the mix of Muppet comedy with the darker storyline somehow makes Scrooge’s eventual redemption all the more satisfying. Men on Muppets: It’s a tough feat to overshadow the Muppets in a Muppet Movie, but Caine almost manages it. That said, he’s made it clear he was lucky to work in the prescence of true greats like Kermit, telling GQ years later that the frog is “much more famous” than he is.  “Oh Kermit is much more famous, because he’s known by children as well as all adults. And I’m known by many, many, many adults, but he’s known by all adults. And then I’m known by few children, but he’s known by every child.”Although there are many great Muppet movies, there’s only one “The Muppet Movie.” The original film quite simply is lightning in a bottle, delievering an earnest story of friendship on top of laughs, and classic musical numbers on top of technically impressive puppetry. Following the origin story of the Muppets, the film sees Kermit leave swamp home in Florida for Los Angeles, meeting up with the cast we’ve come to know and love in the process. It’s a great set-up for funny gags, and some killer music courtesy of Paul Williams; “Rainbow Connection” is one of the most iconic songs in all of film, but “Moving Right Along” and “I’m Gonna Go Back There Someday” are alternatively toe-tapping and deeply emotional. The whole film works because it feels like a thesis statement for why the Muppets are important; Kermit’s journey isn’t to find fame, but to make millions of people happy. And few films can make you more happy than “The Muppets Movie” can.   Men on Muppets: The Muppets are such an esteemed fixture of Hollywood that their first cinematic outing featured many all-star cameos, but no get was bigger than “Citizen Kane” director himself Orson Welles. Welles was a longtime admirer of the group; he referred to “Sesame Street,” the TV series that saw Kermit get his start, “the greatest thing that ever happened to television.” ",

        "content": "Parker Posey knows the pitfalls of being an indie darling.The “Party Girl” breakout star recalled being pigeonholed as an indie actress early in her career, leading her to lose mainstream roles to Sandra Bullock and Julia Roberts, among other stars. Posey told Vogue that she auditioned for “Speed” before the part went to Bullock, and shared even being told by her agent that she was “too indie.”“I wasn’t really getting offered anything good,” Posey said of the early 2000s coming off of her iconic turn in “Scream 3.” “I would audition for all these great parts that ended up going to bigger names like Julia Roberts or Sandra Bullock.”She added that she asked her agent at the time, “‘Can’t I just be Matt Damon’s ex-wife in two or three scenes of some action movie?’ I would never get those either. I asked what the feedback was and my agent told me, ‘They say you’re too indie.'”The label also affected Posey’s status on Broadway after producers of 2012 Yale Repertory Theater play “The Realistic Joneses” recast Posey with Marisa Tomei after the production transferred to Broadway.“It was not a very happy time,” the “Beau Is Afraid” star said. “But, hey, that’s how the industry works.”Over her decades-long career, Posey cited finding inspiration from working with Nora Ephron, despite being cut from “Sleepless in Seattle” before collaborating with Ephron on “Mixed Nuts” and “You’ve Got Mail.”“Nora was so supportive,” Posey said. “She told me I was a ‘gifted comedienne,’ which I’d never been called before.”Posey reflected on the peak “punk” era of indie filmmaking, including her role in “The House of Yes.”“I got lucky because at a time in the culture, you could do Off Broadway and afford your $700 a month apartment,” Posey told The New York Times in February 2023. “And you could do independent movies: ‘It’s only 22 days, yeah, I’ll do that one.’ It was kind of punk rock or like being in a band. Everyone was hanging out together and it was very organic. It was a little pocket of time that didn’t last that long.”",

The film was announced in February 2023.“I don’t know when it’s happening so I can’t tease anything,” Qualley said of the upcoming production, which is separate from Paul King’s yet-untitled Astaire film starring Tom Holland, with whom Qualley’s “Sanctuary” co-star Christopher Abbott appears opposite in Apple TV+ series “The Crowded Room.”“Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” breakout Qualley previously told IndieWire in 2019 that she was “really nervous” to portray real-life Tony winner Reinking in “Fosse/Verdon.”“I looked up to her for so long, was so familiar with her. I really did watch her [on video] in the back of a minivan on my way to dance countless time,” Qualley said. “More than anything, I wanted her to like it. I didn’t even know her yet, but I was already thinking about that.”Qualley added at the time, “I really wouldn’t have had these opportunities as a dancer, I don’t think. I worked really hard, but I don’t think I would have been good enough to have the opportunities that I’ve had. Weirdly, I’m not as good of a dancer as I used to be, but somehow I’ve been able to work in some true childhood dreams. I’m counting my lucky stars.”",

        "title": "Here’s the 20 Hottest Titles for Sale at Cannes",
        "content": "Once upon a time, Todd Haynes’ hot Cannes Competition title “May December” — a psychological drama based on the Mary Kay Letourneau case, starring Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore — would already have a North American distributor. (A source placed its budget just under $20 million.) However, we no longer live in a world where buyers will overpay for a film before they can gauge its theatrical value: The risk is just too great.That’s why sellers CAA and UTA opted to not show the film to distributors before the festival. Instead, they’re betting that an enthusiastic response from Cannes media and audiences will boost its sale price.“People are being skittish about paying top dollar for a movie as easily as they did in the past,” said Sony Pictures Classics co-president Michael Barker. At Cannes, SPC will screen the Pedro Almodovar gay western short “Strange Way of Life” starring Ethan Hawke and Pedro Pascal; it will be released in the fall.“May December” presold a handful of international territories, which mitigates some of the risk. Sellers hope that still represents a viable business model.“It gives us continued confidence that there are equity investors willing to take chances on original stories like this, ” the agent said.  “And when a film like this works, it helps support our independent business and hopefully make investors a little less risk averse.”To understand buyers’ caution, look no further than Cannes 2022 when Ruben Ostlund’s English-language comedy “Triangle of Sadness” made an $8 million domestic sale to Neon before it took home the Palme d’Or. Despite strong reviews and three Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Director, and Original Screenplay, the movie topped out at $4.6 million domestic and $25.6 million worldwide. Ostlund is this year’s jury president.Sophie Mas (“The Witch,” “Call Me By Your Name”), who is Portman’s producing partner at their new banner MountainA and a producer on “May December,” says the film turned out better than they could’ve imagined. “It’s our job to take bets and then to know that it’s going to be great,” she said. “And if you don’t have the reaction right away or if you want to find the best partner, you’re taking the chance of waiting more and having a better deal. I think we knew what we had in our hands, and let’s see what happens on the 20th, but I think there’s a reason why we’re confident.”Another major title in the official selection seeking distribution is Henry VIII’s bodice-ripper “Firebrand,” starring Jude Law as the English monarch and Alicia Vikander as his sixth and final Queen. There’s also potential Oscar submissions in films by Italian auteur Nanni Moretti (comedy “A Brighter Tomorrow”) and French filmmaker Justine Triet (courtroom thriller “Anatomy of a Fall”).Apple TV+ will bring Martin Scorsese’s highly anticipated epic “Killers of the Flower Moon” (October, Paramount), but no one expects streamers to be in active acquisitions mode. Apple TV+, Netflix, and Amazon will check out titles and take meetings, but they all have plenty of in-house content and — as always — they’re unlikely to want movies that are not available for the whole world.The Cannes market, with its packages and promos, is a different animal. “It’s a finance and pre-selling market. Completed films in the market don’t tend to be super high-end movies,” said Cinetic Media CEO John Sloss, who will sell an Anita Pallenberg documentary showing in Cannes Classics.David Garrett, CEO for sales agent Mister Smith Entertainment, which reps the fantasy adventure “Riddle of Fire” in Directors Fortnight and will sell Emma Roberts comedy “Hot Mess,” said the market packages steer away from dramas and toward more marketable genres and stars.Another sales agent described this year’s market as surprisingly eclectic with multiple English-language properties available. “Last year was our biggest Cannes ever, and this year may top that. We’ll see. Fingers crossed,” FilmNation’s SVP of international sales Rob Carney said. “I actually expect this to be a pretty lively market.”Among the titles for sale are two biopics: “Voyagers,” Sebastian Lelio’s latest starring Andrew Garfield and Daisy Edgar-Jones as stargazers Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan, and “Maria,” from director Pablo Larraín and writer Steven Knight, starring Angelina Jolie as Maria Callas. And in a change of pace, Emma Thompson stars in action thriller “The Fisherwoman,” from “Luther” creator Brian Kirk.The ongoing writers strike led to a rush assembly of packages, but it’s unclear what impact, if any, they will have on the Cannes market. Writing is already locked on many of the packages and international players dominate Cannes. The studios’ prep work could represent a shift in the sellers’ favor; Garrett even speculated that the strike puts an actor on hiatus on a show or movie, they could become available for production on a package in waiting. (Now if directors and actors go on strike, that’s another story.)The market was already uncertain before the strike. Ask specialty distributors about the state of the North American theatrical market for indie films and they waffle even on generalities. “It’s hopefully heading in the right direction,” said Sloss. “It’s still challenging. Hopefully we will have better evidence later in the summer. People need movies and always will need movies.”Roadside Attractions co-president Howard Cohen, who bought Oscar-winning “Judy” off a promo reel at Cannes, is looking at Wes Anderson’s “Asteroid City” (Focus) as the test of “the ongoing dialogue between the specialty market and the audience,” he said. “It’s the blue-chip movie for this audience. If they come back for that, are they going to start coming back? Everybody is not sure.”Barker said that while they aren’t coming back quickly, “people are coming back to movie theaters for independent movies. Theatrical is the primary.” Still, distributors are adjusting spends and viewing theatrical as a marketing tool for ancillary markets. “The marketplace isn’t responding even when you spend money,” said Cohen.Sloss said he sees “signs of life” in the turbulent documentary market, he said. Submarine’s Dan and Josh Braun will show footage from the first documentary about Brian Eno, and will screen Nick Broomfield’s Brian Jones documentary in the Cannes market.“A lot of films look alluring at Cannes,” Barker said. “One of the beauties of Cannes is you can go in and the title is unknown and walk out with something wonderful.”Title: “May December” (Competition)\nDirector: Todd Haynes\nStars: Natalie Portman, Julianne Moore\nGenre: True-crime drama\nSeller: CAA and UTA\nBuzz: The word is it’s entertaining, accessible, and could be Oscar catnip.

During the production of Netflix’s “Back in Action” opposite Cameron Diaz, Foxx was hospitalized.“We wanted to share that, my father, Jamie Foxx, experienced a medical complication yesterday,” Corinne wrote on Instagram April 12. “Luckily, due to quick action and great care, he is already on his way to recovery. We know how beloved he is and appreciate your prayers. The family asks for privacy during this time.”On May 12, Corinne shared on Instagram Stories, “Update from the family: Sad to see how the media runs wild. My Dad has been out of the hospital for weeks, recuperating. In fact, he was playing pickleball yesterday! Thanks for everyone’s prayers and support!”Corinne teased, “We have an exciting work announcement coming next week too!”Fox Entertainment announced that Nick Cannon would be taking over Foxx’s “Beat Shazam” hosting duties while the actor is on the mend. A statement was shared to Foxx’s Instagram account that same day on May 3, “Appreciate all the love!!! Feeling blessed. Appreciate ya my boy @nickcannon. See u all soon.”Foxx is listed on IMDb as having 10 upcoming projects in the works in addition to “Back in Action,” with the “Strays” release date also being pushed back.In April 2022, Foxx addressed his shelved directorial debut “All-Star Weekend,” which co-stars Robert Downey Jr., Benicio del Toro, Gerard Butler, Jeremy Piven, and Eva Longoria. “All-Star Weekend” was filmed in 2016 and centers on two best friends who win tickets to the NBA All-Star game but their travel plans get derailed due to a group of outrageous (and race-swapped) characters.“It’s been tough with the lay of the land when it comes to comedy,” Foxx told CinemaBlend at the time of the now potentially problematic comedy. “We’re trying to break open the sensitive corners where people go back to laughing again. We hope to keep them laughing and run them right into ‘All-Star Weekend’ because we were definitely going for it.”",

        "title": "Vin Diesel Teases ‘Trilogy’ for ‘Fast X’ Franchise Finale",
        "content": "Vin Diesel is revving his engine for yet another “Fast and Furious” film.The lead star and franchise producer teased that a possible “Fast X” trilogy may be in the works. The tenth “Fast and Furious” installment was originally set to be part one of a two-part finale to the long-running high concept films.“Without giving away too much, I can say this, going into making this movie, the studio had asked if this could be a two-parter and after the studio saw this Part One, they said, ‘Could you make “Fast X: The Finale” a trilogy?'” Diesel told Fandango.Co-star Michelle Rodriguez added, “It’s three acts in any story.”Diesel hinted, “You probably are [getting a trilogy].”IndieWire has reached out to Universal for comment.Along with Diesel and Rodriguez, “Fast X” also stars returning stars Sung Kang, Ludacris, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, and Nathalie Emmanuel, with Charlize Theron, Helen Mirren, and Cardi B reprising their supporting roles. Rita Moreno, Jason Momoa, and Brie Larson additionally join the franchise. Meadow Walker, the daughter of late original star Paul Walker, joins Diesel onscreen for the first time, a decade after her father’s death following a car accident.“Thanks to my dad, I was born into the ‘Fast’ family,” Walker wrote on Instagram. “I can’t believe now I get to be up there too with those who have been around to see me grow up…I am so blessed to be able to honor my father’s legacy and share this with him forever.”Per the official synopsis for “Fast X,” Dominic Toretto (Diesel) and his crew must seek help in their fight against Cipher (Theron) when she recruits Dante (Momoa), a mysterious new adversary. The logline teases that the “end of the road begins” with the new film.“Fast X” is directed by “Lupin” and “Now You See Me” helmer Louis Leterrier after “Fast and Furious” franchise director Justin Lin departed the production, allegedly over a rumored argument with lead star Diesel. Leterrier has been confirmed to helm the next — and previously announced, final — installment, as Universal shared in April 2023.“Fast X” speeds into theaters May 19.WATCH: On the red carpet in Rome, Italy, did Vin Diesel just confirm that #FastX is the first part of a… trilogy?!

        "title": "Natalie Portman Reflects on ‘Leon, the Professional’: It Has ‘Some Cringey, to Say the Least, Aspects to It’ ",
        "content": "Natalie Portman is looking back on “Léon, the Professional.”The 1994 film, helmed by Luc Besson, stars Portman as a young orphan who was mentored by a professional hitman (Jean Reno) after her family is murdered. Portman was 11 years old when she was cast in her film debut that had undertones of a sexual relationship.“It’s a movie that’s still beloved, and people come up to me about it more than almost anything I’ve ever made,” Portman told The Hollywood Reporter, “and it gave me my career, but it is definitely, when you watch it now, it definitely has some cringey, to say the least, aspects to it. So, yes, it’s complicated for me.”Portman addressed the allegations against “Léon, the Professional” director Luc Besson, who was accused in 2018 of repeatedly raping Dutch-Belgian actress Sand Van Roy over the course of two years. The case against Besson was dismissed in 2021 after an investigation.“It’s devastating,” Portman said of the Besson accusations, adding that “of course” she was shocked by the claims.“I really didn’t know,” Portman explained of her experience with Besson. “I was a kid working. I was a kid. But I don’t want to say anything that would invalidate anyone’s experience.”The “V for Vendetta” actress previously compared “Léon, the Professional” to “Lolita” and opened up about being “sexualized” at age 11.“I was definitely aware of the fact that I was being portrayed as this ‘Lolita’ figure,” Portman said in 2020. “Being sexualized as a child, I think took away from my own sexuality because it made me afraid, and it made me [feel] like the way I could be safe was to be like, ‘I’m conservative,’ and ‘I’m serious and you should respect me,’ and ‘I’m smart,’ and ‘don’t look at me that way.'”She added, “So many people had this impression of me that I was super serious and conservative and I realized I consciously cultivated that because it was always to make me feel safe. Like, ‘Oh, if someone respects you, they’re not going to objectify you.’ When I was in my teens I was like, ‘I don’t want to have any love scenes or make-out scenes.’ I would start choosing parts that were less sexy because it made me worried about the way I was perceived and how safe I felt.”",

        "title": "3 Ways the Cannes Film Festival Will Shake Up the Industry Next Week",
        "content": "The Cannes Film Festival may be the best-known gathering for showcasing cinema from around the world, but it can also whip up a lot of news for the film industry. Last year’s energetic launch for “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Elvis” kickstarted their successful commercial and awards season cycles. Now, as pandemic-era challenges recede to the background, Cannes is back with more potential to shake up the news cycle.In this week’s Screen Talk, Eric Kohn and Anne Thompson discuss some of the ways that the 2023 edition is certain to generate conversation. Read on for three big takeaways from the episode.Watch or listen to the full podcast above. Screen Talk listeners attending Cannes this year, take note! A live edition of the podcast will take place at the American Pavilion on Tuesday, May 23, at 2 p.m. You will need AMPAV accreditation to attend, but listeners who want to attend and need help with access can reach out to Kohn via Twitter.Critics and journalists often get a chance to pre-screen some of the bigger movies at the festival (as was the case with “Top Gun: Maverick” last year). But Disney is taking the opposite route with “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” the fifth and apparently final entry in the franchise, which will make its big debut for the media alongside the rest of the Cannes crowd early in the festival. With the generally reliable director James Mangold taking the reins from Steven Spielberg, the movie is being positioned as a lively finale with major blockbuster appeal beyond the nostalgia factor. It’s also a final chance to salute 80-year-old Harrison Ford as his most famous character — and the actor will be on hand to receive an honorary Palme d’Or, which means there will be a lot of good vibes for his legacy coinciding with the premiere.Buyers will be looking for available movies around the festival, but — as Thompson reports — the big streamers aren’t necessarily eager to load up on available projects. Meanwhile, there are only two buzzy acquisition titles in the Official Competition this year: “May December” and “Firebrand.” They have name talent and real potential to play well for Cannes audiences, but it remains unclear how buyers will respond to them in that context. Look for more action at the Cannes market, which is expected to return to pre-COVID levels of activity despite the possible impact of the WGA strike on upcoming productions.Cannes has programmed more women in competition than ever before; it also chose not to screen the new Woody Allen film. Has the festival moved in a more progressive direction this year? That will become clearer once films screen and the environment takes shape. But there are some early indications that the festival has made some new efforts to evolve and meet the demands of the current cultural landscape. Then again, many of the films directed by women have been programmed at the end of the festival this year…so, we’ll see.Also in week’s podcast: Discussion of new releases “Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie,” “Sanctuary,” and “BlackBerry.”Screen Talk is produced by Azwan Badruzaman and available on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, and Spotify, and hosted by Megaphone.

        "title": "‘Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3’ Says Goodbye to James Gunn’s Misfit Superheroes in the Bowie Spaceship",
        "content": "It’s fitting that James Gunn’s “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” wraps up with Rocket’s origin story in the largest spaceship in MCU history: The Bowie, which debuted in “The Holiday Special.” According to the backstory, the massive, four-story craft was built by power tool expert Rocket (Bradley Cooper). “We always thought of it as the muscle car of spaceships,” production designer Beth Mickle (“The Holiday Special,” “The Suicide Squad”) told IndieWire.In honor of Rocket, the Bowie ended up in the shape of a giant circular saw after initial sketches involved various power tool designs. The art department then built the Bowie’s interior as a series of interconnected sets (three stories high) with seven different areas on a 20,000-square-foot stage at Trilith Studios in Atlanta.“We wanted the physical spaces to all be connected by these circular shapes, which we hadn’t seen much of before,” Mickle said. “And we staged scenes in every single one of them so that the actors could literally walk from one area to another without interruption. We wanted it to feel as real for the audience as it possibly could.”As a result, the central corridor wraps around like a large cylinder, and the med bay, where Rocket spends a lot of time, forms a perfect circle. “And we wanted a really sizable pilot bay two stories tall,” she continued, “with a big, beautiful, glass canopy looking out. So we took the lines of the architecture from the exterior.”The only VFX cheat (production supervised by Marvel’s Stephane Ceretti and carried out by Sony Pictures Imageworks) occurred when an elevator didn’t work that was supposed to take Quill (Chris Pratt), Drax (Dave Bautista), and Mantis (Pom Klementieff) from the central core to the pilot bay. “That was the CGI of having the background behind them lower to give the effect that they were rising and it worked beautifully,” added Mickle.The production designer, who is one of the few women in the industry working on superhero tentpoles, also wanted a very special color palette for the Bowie. She settled on teal and pink, which blended well together, and Gunn immediately approved. “I had never seen a wine-pink color in a spaceship,” Mickle said. “So we thought, OK, let’s put these colors onto the body of this. It all happened very quickly, and within two or three weeks of early concepts I had a rough pass and took it to James, and he was really excited by it.”Another fun fact is that they put a toilet on the Bowie, also pretty rare. Of course, it’s no ordinary toilet seat: It’s made from the same cotton material as old ice packs, courtesy of set decorator Rosemary Brandenburg. “And so if you look, when Gamora [Zoe Saldaña] is sitting in there, you can actually see the fabric gusset like a big ice pack,” Mickle said.The rest of the world building was just as imaginative, from the 300-mile-high red Arete skyscraper spacecraft in the shape of a cube, to the ’70s Counter-Earth planet, to the cold and sterile Halfworld lair of the villainous High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji), to his bizarre intergalactic bio-engineering company, Orgocorp.“For the Orgocorp planet, James said he wanted it to be all flesh,” Mickle said. “We worked from a photo of a spaceship module that looked sort of flesh-like in its texture and other flesh references to come up with something that could feel like a biologically grown world. But, in addition to all the flesh, we had lots of mechanics, lots of metal piping, lots of metal hosing, lots bone architecture, lots of gadgetry attached to it all.”The color palette was limited but striking, with fleshy, white and pink plant life scattered throughout along with a yellow liquid that ran everywhere. “Then we just had the pop of red with the costumes, and that set for me was very successful because of the limited color palette,” said Mickle.Now it’s on to production designing Gunn’s “Superman: Legion” for Mickle, who got a taste of DC with “The Suicide Squad.” Of course, Gunn is not only writing and directing the as-yet-to-be-cast “Superman” reboot (scheduled for a June 11, 2025, release from Warner Bros.) but rebuilding DC Studios with producing partner Peter Safran as co-CEOs.“He has a very fresh vision for the direction that the DC world can take, and he’s really committed to doing that,” Mickle said of Gunn and his rock ‘n’ roll, misfit ethos. “It’s exciting to see his notes and his references and to hear him talk about how he envisions this movie we’re going to make.”Mickle added that “Superman: Legion” is already the highlight of her career. “I’ve talked about it with my peers how women just haven’t gotten to do movies of this tentpole franchise level. Only in the last five years have women been given any opportunities in this arena.” For her, the Man of Steel personifies “optimism, hope, and goodness.”",

        "title": "‘Fool’s Paradise’ Review: Charlie Day’s Directorial Debut Is Far from Sunny",
        "content": "The sun has set on Charlie Day‘s “Fool’s Paradise” before it’s even risen.The cringe comedy that serves as both a farcical ode to Old Hollywood and a Charlie Chaplin-esque platform for writer-director-star Day is…not good. Pair the off-beat script with a slew of celebrity cameos and the film feels more like a “Threat Level Midnight” inside joke amongst Day’s A-lister pals. It’s an Adam Sandler sensibility of filmmaking without the wide-appeal marketability. At best, “Fool’s Paradise” could have been a hilarious “The Other Two” episode about the hollow insanity of Hollywood and the sleight-of-hand trick behind the magic of movies. Sadly, “Fool’s Paradise” instead keeps viewers trapped in the nine circles of hell.Day pulls double (quadruple?) duty as a psychiatric patient who has lost the ability to speak due to severe trauma, and his misbehaving Method actor doppleganger, Thomas Bingsley. The film opens on a desperate publicist (Ken Jeong) who is looking to find the next big actor and make a “a real somebody from a nobody.” That “nobody” turns out to be a mental health patient diagnosed with a “mind of a five-year-old or a Labrador retriever” as part of a “medically undefinable” case. Of course, the unnamed man is forced out of a hospital due to a lack of mental healthcare from the state.Is it funny, or problematic? Day channels both Chaplin and Steve Martin’s Ruprecht sequence in “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,” on mute. He’s picked up on the side of the road by a mega-producer (Ray Liotta) who gives him a ride to the set of “Billy the Kid” in which Thomas Bingsley (also Day) has holed himself up in his trailer to down booze and sling Western slang to stay “in character.” The mental patient, now known by Latte Pronto for Liotta having aggressively demanded a latte from a P.A., steps in as a body double, and later a lead star, after Thomas accidentally kills himself practicing a hanging scene for the movie. It’s essentially the Eddie Murphy plotline of “Bowfinger,” complete with Latte’s co-star, played by Kate Beckinsale, seducing him as part of his induction into the incestuous and predatory nature of Hollywood. Hey, didn’t Heather Graham already do that in the 1999 send-up of the industry that actually is a comedy classic?Adrien Brody, Edie Falco, and Jason Sudeikis also star as industry insiders, with Common, Jason Bateman, John Malkovich, and Jillian Bell appearing in cameo roles. It’s clear that Day’s real-life friends are having a ball during production, but it’d be nice if audiences were also in on the joke.Yet it’s late icon Liotta, in one of his final performances, that is the small highlight of the film. Liotta screaming “Fuck off!” into a cellphone and arguably being the only sane character makes him the ideal (and slightly unhinged) straight man to whatever the hell Day is doing onscreen. The only saving grace of “Fool’s Paradise” is watching Liotta do what he did best.Sadly, Liotta isn’t the main star. Day, an “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” scene-stealer, traps himself in an unfunny slapstick comedy with references to Orson Welles and Angelina Jolie. Sure, Latte Pronto can climb the ladder of Hollywood without saying a word. The only problem is the would-be inside jokes of “Fool’s Paradise” fall on deaf ears.Rating: DA Roadside Attractions release, “Fool’s Paradise” is now playing in theaters.",

        "title": "‘The Starling Girl’ Trusts You to Know That This Is Not a ‘Lolita’ Story",
        "content": "As cultural “discourse” becomes more aligned with scare-quotes than substantive conversations, putting a complicated piece of art into the world can be terrifying. “Sometimes, it’s scary to trust the audience,” said “The Starling Girl” writer and director Laurel Parmet. “It’s also invigorating and thrilling.”Parmet’s directorial debut is loosely based on her own coming-of-age story, during which she had a relationship with an older man when she was just a teenager. Set against the backdrop of a patriarchal fundamentalist church community, “The Starling Girl” stars Eliza Scanlen as Jem Starling, a curious and clever teen whose world is upended by the return of intriguing young pastor Owen (Lewis Pullman). Drawn to each other despite many constraints that should keep them apart — their age difference, the power dynamic, and much more — their relationship serves as the catalyst for Jem fully coming into herself.It’s a tricky story that risks becoming incendiary in the current culture. When the film premiered at Sundance 2023, IndieWire’s own (very positive) review from our David Ehrlich generated social media rancor for a headline that called Pullman’s character “sexy” and said that Scanlen’s character “sins with” him. It was a clicky header, but it also captured the film’s tension. Owen is appealing. Jem does believe, for a time, that she’s an equal in their relationship. The film is built on that gray area and works for viewers willing to make space for it. “That’s part of what I think is par for the course when you’re telling a story that is so nuanced,” Parmet said during a recent interview with IndieWire. “We definitely want to be having those conversations, and that’s part of the point of the film. But this is what’s so difficult about advertising the film and then social media and Twitter, where there’s really just no room for nuance. It’s all about brevity and it’s all about how to talk about the film in so many words and in sound bites. That was something difficult for us, even when we were cutting the trailer and talking about how to market the film. It’s like, how do you convey the nuance that a two-hour film conveys?”Scanlen, who also joined us on Zoom, hopes audiences are willing to look past tropes to appreciate the film’s own deeply considered take. “Audiences are familiar with those stereotypes where you either have the young girl who falls in love with an older man, and she’s a victim of abuse and she’s not portrayed to wield any sort of agency, and then you have the other end of the spectrum where the creator is just completely eroticizing that power dynamic, like ‘Lolita,’” Scanlen said. “Laurel wanted to steer clear of both of those stereotypes and create something — yeah, I’m going to say the word again — something with more nuance.”Parmet said navigating that was “the entire focus” of her filmmaking process. “I was asking myself that as I was writing and as I was directing every single day, ‘How do we get this delicate dance down right?,’” Parmet said. “We’re trying to show these two characters fall into this romance and get invested in these characters, while at the same time highlighting how it’s problematic. It’s such a tightrope walk. It extended to every part of the filmmaking process.”Parmet found her solution by approaching the story through Jem’s perspective. “It was about grounding the film in Jem’s experience 100 percent, so that the audience experiences the relationship, how she experiences it, and creating something that is vivid and intoxicating and intimate and immediate,” Parmet said. “Bringing the audience on this journey where they’re really experiencing everything that she’s experiencing in real time, I think that is how you accomplish that.”That meant trusting the audience to see things through Jem’s eyes. “That was the most fun part of directing,” she said. “At the beginning of a scene, they [might] feel one way about the relationship, and then in the middle of the scene, they feel a totally different way about the relationship, and then at the end of the scene they’re like, ‘Oh, wait, maybe I am rooting for it again.’”Said Scanlen, “It’s a much more interesting experience for the audience when they’re challenged. Laurel was exploring a moral gray area, and the only way that she could do that was to completely immerse the audience in Jem’s perspective. They can experience with Jem her confusion and her guilt, and how she oscillates between her desire for Owen and her desire to be her own person and free from shame and the restriction that she feels as a result of being in this community.”In practice, that meant lots of experimentation. “Lewis had to try many different versions of Owen’s intentions in various scenes,” Scanlen said. “To have those different options made it easier for Laurel to manipulate those scenes in post-production so that the audience was able to experience that ride with Jem.”Parmet added, “Just to be able to turn those dials up on Owen’s charm and down on Owen’s charm and to play with where in the story I want the audience to be connecting with him and what I want them to feel repulsed. It was very calculated.”However, Parmet said she didn’t want to manipulate her audience; she wanted to trust them. “We didn’t want to force interpretations on the audience through visuals or through music,” Parmet said. “There are hardly any insert shots in the film, because I just felt like they emphasize moments too much. It was about being present with the characters and allowing these moments to unfold and resonate more organically, to have the restraint that would encourage viewers to form their own conclusions about what’s on screen.”Parmet said she was inspired to set the story inside a religious community after connecting with a group of fundamentalist women at an Oklahoma rodeo while researching another project. She didn’t share their upbringing, but found that their feelings attached to growing up as women in a male-dominated world were eerily similar. She also spent months interviewing members of communities that experienced church abuse, and the production brought on consultants to serve as a resource for the cast.“Jem’s feelings of shame, I resonated with growing up,” Scanlen said. “I think every girl at some point in their life experiences that at different levels. I’m not religious, but I did go to a Catholic school and I would have what you call Catholic guilt. Those are very formative years in your life, and I definitely was taught to be perhaps a little bit more reserved. I think that women are often taught at a young age to feel shame around their sexuality and expressing their desires.”Scanlen also pointed to the impact that entertainment can have on young minds. “I won’t name the film, but I was just watching a film on the plane and some parts were funny, but all the jokes that were being made where the woman was the butt of the joke I wasn’t laughing at all,” Scanlen said. “It was just deeply offensive, and it just made me think about how you imbibe those beliefs and assumptions about women at such an age.”Parmet added, “You don’t even realize that it’s happening, but you’re just indoctrinated.”If the pair sound like they’re in sync, that’s because they are. Even during a Zoom interview where they were thousands of miles apart — Parmet in Los Angeles, Scanlen back in her native Australia — the pair listened intently and never cut off each other before adding their own take on a line of thought. “Eliza is my creative partner for life,” the filmmaker said. “She’s, I think, the best actress of her generation.”In contrast to the online tongue-clucking, Parmet and Scanlen said they have experienced plenty of positive feedback from in-person audiences. “Pretty much after every single screening, we’ve had people come up to me who were raised in the church in some fashion, they’re struggling with their faith currently, or they have left a conservative church,” Parmet said. “People have come up to me and said how much the film resonated with them and how seen they felt. We oftentimes have these very emotional conversations. It was so important to me that the film feel authentic and truthful, so it feels like it’s working and I’m really, really happy for that. We spent a lot of time trying to get that right.”Scanlen also noted that she’s particularly pleased with the reactions to how the film tackles religion. It’s not judgemental, but that can be a hard thing to sell in a log line or a sound bite or a Twitter reaction. “People really appreciate that Laurel didn’t want to criticize religion, she didn’t want to make any kind of moral statement about religion, but to actually show that you can have many different kinds of relationships with God or a higher being and that there’s nothing inherently wrong about that in particular,” Scanlen said. “That’s what Jem ultimately discovers in the end, her own unique relationship with God.”Who would Parmet most like to see at her film’s opening weekend? “I want anyone who loves films to go see this film, but I think this film speaks particularly to female-identifying people, anyone who has experienced trying to figure out who they are in the face of all of the expectations that the world places on us. It’s about the freedoms and the dangers that those searches can bring. I think anybody can relate to that.”A Bleecker Street release, “The Starling Girl” will hit theaters on Friday, May 12.",

        "title": "The Best Movies New to Every Major Streaming Platform in May 2023",
        "content": "Netflix may get most of the attention, but it’s hardly a one-stop shop for cinephiles looking to stream essential classic and contemporary films. Each of the prominent streaming platforms caters to its own niche of film obsessives.From the boundless wonders of the Criterion Channel to the new frontiers of streaming offered by the likes of Disney+ and Max , IndieWire’s monthly guide highlights the best of what’s coming to every major streamer, with an eye toward exclusive titles that may help readers decide which of these services is right for them.Here is your guide for May 2023.Kate Erbland, Sophie Monks Kaufman, Tambay Obenson, and Esther Zuckerman also contributed to this article. This May might very well become the month that Apple TV+ starts turning into a must-subscribe for movie fans — not because of anything that’s premiering on the platform over the next few weeks, but rather because of what’s premiering in Cannes during the same time period as a preview of things to come.But while Davis Guggenheim’s “Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie” may not have quite the same cachet as Martin Scorsese’s imminent “The Killers of the Flower Moon,” this sensitive and unflinching doc is very much worth a watch.Here’s what Esther Zuckerman wrote about the film from its Sundance premiere in January:“Upsetting as it is to confront the pain that Parkinson’s Disease has wrought upon Michael J. Fox’s body, the actor is nothing if not a likable figure, and he and Guggenheim have crafted a likable film about both his suffering and resilience without turning him into a martyr. The wise conceit Guggenheim (‘An Inconvenient Truth’) uses to tell Fox’s story involves recutting the actor’s movie and TV appearances to fit his narration about his real life. This is to say that Alex P. Keaton and Marty McFly act out Fox’s ascent to fame. Scenes from ‘Family Ties’ and ‘Bright Lights, Big City’ show his courtship with Tracy Pollan. As he grapples with his denial about the challenges his body faces he also dodges gunfire in ‘Mars Attacks!’ These images of Fox frequently running and doling out punchlines with his perfect timing stand in stark contrast to the footage of Fox in the present day where his mind seems to work faster than his ability to express himself and his legs consistently fail him. It’s not without some of the conventional beats of a star-driven documentary, but it also refuses to turn maudlin when it so easily could.”Available to stream May 12.Based on quantity alone, Criterion Channel’s May slate might not seem as robust as their average monthly lineup, but a quick look under the surface reveals a rich and typically well-curated array of essential movies that should be able to keep anyone happy from now until June.The fun starts with a 14-film series devoted to the anarchic Japanese director Seijun Suzuki; Suzuki’s deliriously cool Yakuza masterpieces (e.g. “Youth of the Beast,” “Tokyo Drifter”) have been staples of the Criterion library since the company’s inception, but his even more unclassifiable late-career freak-outs have proven more elusive. There’s no topping the art-pop majesty of “Branded to Kill,” but the surreal and endlessly protean likes of “Zigeunerweisen” and “Yumeji” offer broader insight into one of the 20th century’s most irrepressible film artists.Bridging the gap between Japan (along with the rest of Asia) and the Western world is curator Brian Wu’s absolutely unmissable series devoted to the Asian American films of the 1980s. Anchored to Wayne Wang’s landmark “Chan Is Missing” and extending out to vital gems like Steven Okazaki’s “Living on Tokyo Time” and Elliott Hong’s action-comedy “They Call Me Bruce,” the program offers a vibrant and frequently punkish overview of cultural identities cohering on screen at a critical moment in the history of independent film. Elsewhere, the Channel is serving up a retrospective of James Stewart films directed by Anthony Mann (don’t miss “Winchester ’73”), a fond tribute to the great Jennifer Jason Leigh (there’s never a bad time or reason to revisit “In the Cut”), and the exclusive streaming premiere of Jafar Panahi’s excellent “No Bears.”All titles available to stream May 1.Well, it was either this, the nature documentary “Wildlife,” or a family movie that I haven’t seen about three kids who steal a rover so that they can explore a crater in outer space. It’s called “Crater,” and in hindsight I probably should’ve just gone with that instead. Only a streaming service that owned the rights to Pixar’s entire library in perpetuity could get away with phoning it in this hard.Available to stream May 17.Other highlights:\n– “Crater” (5/12)\n– “Wildlife” (5/26)I’ll be honest with you: I haven’t actually seen “The Cynic, the Rat and the Fist,” but as a fan of both Umberto Lenzi’s splashy giallo fare (e.g. “Seven Bloodstained Orchids”) and a fan of movies with absolutely incredible titles, this explosive poliziotteschi about a prison escapee hellbent on murdering the man who put him behind bars is still an easy choice for our pick of the month.It highlights a concise but potent blast of refreshingly unexpected content from the good folks at Film Movement, whose May slate also includes Lenzi’s “Almost Human” and “Brothers Till We Die” in addition to the early Mel Gibson vehicle “Attack Force Z” and some higher-brow fare like the recent Canadian drama “Drunken Birds” and the sensitive Israeli suicide drama “The Day After I’m Gone.”Available to stream May 19.Other highlights:\n– “Drunken Birds” (5/5)\n– “Attack Force Z” (5/5)\n– “The Day After I’m Gone” (5/19)Hulu’s partnership with some of the film world’s strongest production labels continues to pay off with another month of excellent arthouse fare that stands out from the library stuff that dominates the biggest streaming platforms every month. The platform’s May slate is highlighted by three NEON titles from last year’s festival circuit, the best of which is Alice Diop’s stunning “Saint Omer.”Here’s some of what Sophie Monks Kaufman had to say about the film when it premiered in Venice in September:“For her first narrative film, French filmmaker Alice Diop brings the rhythms of her documentary background to reconstruct a heavy, ripped-from-the-headlines story. In 2013, Fabienne Kabou left her 15-month-year old baby girl on a beach in Berck-sur-Mer to be claimed by the rising tide. Diop read about the story while pregnant and felt an intimate connection, one that she has written into ‘Saint Omer’ through an alter-ego.Rama (Kayije Kagame) is a pregnant academic who decides to watch the court case of the mother on trial, here rechristened Laurence Coly (Guslagie Malanga), ostensibly as part of her research into the most famous baby killer of all, Medea. Despite her academic interest, the mere act of witnessing Laurence’s trial gets under Rama’s skin, and lines of association between Rama, Laurence, Rama’s unborn baby, and her very real mother are blurred until the central tragedy of it all belongs to everyone.Although technically a work of fiction, ‘Saint Omer’ is fiercely documentary-like in its concerns. The questions it conjures are not the anticipated emotional ones, rather they challenge the audience, asking: what expectations do we carry about a person like Laurence? Do we want to believe that she is evil? Crazy? Is she the product of a ‘foreign’ culture? Is there someone else in her life that we could pin this on? ‘Saint Omer’ doesn’t so much dodge easy answers as reframe the focal point, so that although the film recognizes the injustice done to Baby Elise in its somber atmosphere, Diop’s unflinching yet bracingly empathetic gaze ends up fixed on the nature of motherhood.”Available to stream May 12.Other highlights:\n– “Both Sides of the Blade” (5/4)\n– “Broker” (5/24)RIP HBO Max. Long live Max! Or is it “max”? Or “m@x”? Or “a harebrained scheme to eke out a streaming profit by churning together 100 different brands into a massive blue soup that means nothing to anyone”? Well, whatever the hell it is, you’ll be able to watch “Parasite” on it when it launches, so that’s nice.A comically violent class parable that examines how a society can only be as strong as its most vulnerable people, Bong Joon-ho’s electric Palme d’Or-winner is a tender shiv of a movie that doesn’t rely on its metaphors, or even let them survive; unlike some of the “Snowpiercer” auteur’s other high-concept work, “Parasite” is nothing if not eminently possible.A grounded enough story about the members of a poor Seoul family (led by the great Song Kang-ho) who, one-by-one, each begin working for a nouveau riche family in their sleek mansion up the hill, Bong Joon ho’s Oscar-winning “Parasite” starts as an off-kilter class comedy of sorts before sinking into something wild, unclassifiable, and burning with rage. As heightened as “Okja,” as realistic as “Mother,” and as heart-in-your-throat haunting as “Memories of Murder,” Bong’s latest is a madcap excoriation of life under the pall of late capitalism, and it leaves everyone a little richer at the end of it.Winner of the Palme d’Or at Cannes before going onto become an international sensation, “Parasite” already seems certain to go down as a defining expression of the socioeconomic inequality that has defined so much of the early 21st century, both in Korea and beyond.Available to stream May 19.Other highlights:\n– “Unbreakable” (5/15)\n– “The LEGO Batman Movie” (5/19)\n– “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring” (5/19)IndieWire named “Timbuktu” as one of the best films of the 2010s, and Abderrahmane Sissako’s masterpiece only continues to feel more urgent and perceptive. Here’s what former IndieWire staffer Tambay Obenson wrote about the movie at the end of the previous decade:“A harrowing but lyrical portrayal of a northern Mali community in the grip of a radical Islamist group, Sissako’s ‘Timbuktu’ was always going to hit a nerve. The Mauritanian filmmaker took significant personal risk in making his fifth feature, and he knew that — even when safely completed — the project would be a lightning rod for polemical attacks due to the way it depicted Islam on screen, and cut to the heart of the country’s fraught relationship with artistic expression.But Sissako prevailed. His ability to provide a local perspective on the specific issues ordinary people face, while also offering the world a window into the quotidian hypocrisy of jihadist culture, allowed ‘Timbuktu’ to succeed on a global stage. It resonated across the globe, winning seven César awards and becoming the first film by a Black African filmmaker about Black Africans to earn more than $1 million at the U.S. box office.Sissako’s poetic approach allowed him to temper and complicate the film’s disturbing violence, a tactic crystallized with a soccer game that’s played without the villagers being permitted to use a ball; such is the absurdity of life under fundamentalist rulers, who distort Islam in cruel and clearly unfounded ways in order to justify their atrocities. ‘Timbuktu’ unearthed a pulsing sense of life from beneath an inconceivable plague.”Available to stream May 16.Other highlights:\n– “The White Ribbon” (5/6)\n– “The Wonders” (5/18)\n– “Sátántangó” (5/31)Netflix has precious little in the way of original content to offer its subscribers this month (though we’re obviously still holding out hope for Swedish late-comer, “The Year I Started Masturbating”), but the streamer’s paltry May lineup is buffeted by a strong documentary that flew under the radar at Sundance.Here’s what IndieWire’s Kate Erbland wrote about Nancy Schwartzman’s “Victim/Suspect” back in January:“If anything, ‘Victim/Suspect’ too calmly lays out its case over the course of a tight 90-minute running time. The ‘Roll Red Roll’ filmmaker is again taking on the topic of sexual assault in America with her latest film, which follows investigative reporter Rachel de Leon as she unspools tale after tale of alleged sexual assault victims suddenly, horribly being turned into suspects when the very cops meant to investigate their allegations accuse them of faking all of it. Even worse: They are then charged with a litany of crimes, fully completing the cycle from, yes, victim to suspect.It’s the kind of story that should make viewers rage — at the cops, the system, the world — but Schwartzman sidesteps emotion to cede her story to de Leon, an engaging and dogged journalist who neatly walks us through her reporting process. By the end of ‘Victim/Suspect,’ de Leon has turned up gobsmacking evidence, including numerous incidents of cops just straight lying to these alleged victims, all courtesy of the kind of shoe-leather reporting in short supply these days.”Available to stream May 23.Other highlights:\n– “Starship Troopers” (5/1)\n– “Steel Magnolias” (5/1)\n– “The Year I Started Masturbating” (5/26)OVID’s characteristically unexpected and well-curated May lineup is highlighted by a series of bracing documentaries about modern China, including dGenerate Films’ “Inside the Red Brick Wall,” which offers a ground-level perspective on the pro-democracy protests that turned Hong Kong upside down in 2019, as well as Murray Lerner’s Oscar-winning 1979 doc “From Mao to Mozart: Isaac Stern in China,” which follows the famous violinist as as he collaborates with the China National Symphony Orchestra at a very different time in the country’s history.If that doesn’t do it for you, there’s always Silvana Cesci and Reto Stamm’s “The Queen of Condoms,” which relates the incredible story of the East German woman who followed a Cuban soldier home to the Caribbean and eventually became Fidel Castro’s Sexual Education Minister. OVID’s most high-profile release of the month is likely Salomé Jashi’s awe-inspiring 2021 documentary “Taming the Garden,” about a massive tree that’s ripped out of Georgian soil and sailed across the Black Sea on a tiny barge so that a billionare — Georgian politician Bidzina Ivanishvili — can replant the rare giant in his own personal Eden. Available to stream May 19.Other highlights:\n– “Inside the Red Brick Wall” (5/1)\n– “From Mao to Mozart: Isaac Stern in China” (5/3)\n– “The Queen of Condoms” (5/19)If and when people think “Peacock,” they definitely think “impressionistic Hong Kong auteur Wong Kar-wai.” That’s why the Peacock logo looks so natural and not-at-all objectionably vulgur when you slap it on a still from one of his movies. And so it stands to reason that — sandwiched between similarly incredible seasons of “The Traitors UK” and “The Traitors Australia” — Peacock subscribers are about to be treated to one of the most artful martial arts movies ever made.It’s unlikely that Peacock will offer the far superior director’s cut of Wong’s masterpiece (what, no “The Grandmaster China”?), but beggars can’t be choosers when it comes to a platform that offers 27 seasons of “Access Hollywood” for every worthwhile movie it streams. If Wong’s films suggest the detail and potency of a short story writer, Ip Man biopic “The Grandmaster” is his one true crack at an epic. To call this achingly sad Kung Fu saga a biopic would be misleading in the extreme: For one thing, that suggests the kind of dull linearity that Wong couldn’t do with a gun to his head. For another, “The Grandmaster” is less a focused story about the Foshan-born man who eventually found his way to Hong Kong and became Bruce Lee’s teacher than it is a bittersweet mural that depicts the emotional timbre of an entire migration. And the fight scenes are unlike anything else you’ve ever seen.Available to stream May 1.Other highlights:\n– “The Joy Luck Club” (5/1)\n– “Notting Hill” (5/1)\n– “Schindler’s List” (5/1)Several of last year’s most underappreciated films are making their way to Prime Video this month. Here’s what IndieWire’s Kate Erbland had to say about Maria Schrader’s “She Said” when the journalistic thriller — a sober, harrowing docudrama about the investigative reporters who brought down Harvey Weinstein — premiered at the NYFF in October:“There is, of course, a dark irony to Weinstein — for so long such a Hollywood titan, a bonafide super-producer — getting taken down (again! and good! do it more!) via the kind of awards-y, end-of-year true-life tale the former Miramax head probably would have loved to make, back when he was, oh, you know, not in jail for multiple sex crimes. Hit him where it hurts. But it’s also bitterly hilarious that Weinstein’s downfall came at the hands of two women, the kind of tenacious, emotional, stressed, and heroic people he spent so much of his life and career trying to shut down. Dozens of films could be made about what Weinstein did, how Kantor and Twohey took him down, and the many lives his crimes disrupted, but Schrader’s would likely still be the best of the bunch, a definitive endeavor right out the gate.”Available to stream May 19.Other highlights:\n– “Till” (5/9)\n– “Three Thousand Years of Longing” (5/23)\n– “Violent Night” (5/26)One of the most harrowingly accurate movies ever made about living with grief and the guilt that comes with it, Jennifer Kent’s “The Babadook” leverages dozens of traditional horror tropes into a wrenching portrait of the human pain to which no other genre has such immediate access. Anchored by Essie Davis’ unforgettable turn as a single mother who’s still living in the shadow of her husband’s death, Kent’s brilliant debut feature uses terror as a way to plunge deeper into its heroine’s heartache.The Babadook itself is a marvel (and a burgeoning gay icon?), the amorphous creature popping out from the pages of a mysterious children’s book to wreak all sorts of Rorschach-like havoc on the poor Australian woman who brought it into her home. Yes, the monster is a clear metaphor for depression, but few films have so viscerally realized the residual agony of loss, and how it can never be fully extinguished. Available to stream May 15.Other highlights:\n– “Inside” (5/1)\n– “Consecration” (5/9)\n– “Huesara: The Bone Woman” (5/12)",

        "title": "‘Air’ Dressed Nike Behind the Times So Michael Jordan Looks Like the Future",
        "content": "“Air” was a labor of love for a lot of people, evidenced not least by Ben Affleck’s willingness to wear peak ’80s jackets and athleisure clothing as Nike boss Phil Knight. But all of the clothing, as organized by costume designer Charlese Antoinette Jones, gives audiences a sense of the era in which Nike marketing exec Sonny Vaccaro (Matt Damon) seeks a new kind of partnership with young phenom Michael Jordan. The costumes also help pinpoint Nike’s relative standing in the industry in relation to Converse and Adidas, marking Vaccaro and his team as underdogs. “I wanted [Nike] to feel behind,” Jones told IndieWire. “I wanted them to definitely feel behind the times, like they hadn’t quite caught up to the fashion. I really wanted the Portland offices to reflect that time before we had Internet, before trends were widely dispersed globally like they are now and there were more regional fashion styles.” Denoting geography through fashion was especially important, given the film was shot in Los Angeles; it’s mostly down to how in-line (or not) the different sneaker companies are with ‘the’80s fashions that give a sense of their places in the world and within the hierarchy of sneaker companies. “I’m really proud of being able to distinguish between Portland and Germany, where the Adidas offices are, and Converse, because it’s all [done] through suiting, for the most part,” Jones said. “Even though everyone’s in suits, I’m proud of how different the worlds look, the different geographical styles and vibes. We shot everything in L.A., but it feels global in this cool way.”Nike’s Portland headquarters definitely feel less like a hipster hub and more like the final stop along the Oregon Trail, which makes Sonny’s prospects of signing an NBA star in the making feel like that much more of an uphill climb. The underdog ethos of the Nike offices also helps Phil Knight’s idiosyncrasies stand out all the more, sartorially and otherwise. “It was a time when people didn’t wear athletic wear out much,” Jones said. “There’s very little athletic wear in the film. But we had the opportunity, because Phil goes for a run, and Phil as the leader of the company is way more forward-thinking, so that’s why I was able to put that [purple tracksuit] in the film.” Jones picked up on the idea that Knight would constantly be testing new Nike merchandise, from the blue-black-red windbreaker that marks the nadir of his optimism in the Jordan deal to the hot pink running shorts and shirt Jones built for Knight to wear into the office over the weekend to offer Sonny moral support. But many things in the film came out of Jones’s research into the real Nike of that era. “The tracksuit is based off a ‘60 Minutes’ news segment where he’s actually running in the segment in something very similar, with those crazy Oakley glasses on,” Jones said. “I looked at as many photographs as I could and I figured out, based on the photos over time, what [each character’s] style was and built out closets and made them very distinct characters.” Research also led Jones to a wonderful fashion progression for Dolores Jordan (Viola Davis). She’s also suited for each of the three sneaker pitches, but each suit betrays how comfortable she is (or isn’t) with each deal. “In these meetings, she’s very much [wearing her clothes] like an armor. She’s suited up in darker colors. Then in the Nike meeting, she’s in a lighter color and it’s a little bit more of a relaxed suiting,” Jones said. “It was based on actual research but it worked out for our story as well. So that was like a happy accident.”\n\nBut Jones relishes the other looks she created for Davis, the casual clothes that say something about the life experience and conviction she brings looking after her son’s interests. For the weekend when Sonny ambushes the Jordans at their home, Jones picked out a thrifted T-shirt that nonetheless gives a sense of how formidable Dolores is.  “Back then when you traveled, it was a big deal and you got a special T-shirt and that would be your weekend T-shirt. And she’s a Christian woman, so she would wear a denim skirt of a certain length, a modest length, the Pro-Keds. These are things that I remember as a Black woman my mom and my grandma and my aunties wearing in the ’80s, so it was a really fun [look] to create and make feel natural for that environment and that moment,” Jones said. But the real power move in the film’s costuming is in the choices Jones deliberately did not make until the very end. “There’s minimal red in the film. I don’t really start implementing red until after you see the shoe,” Jones said. “After you see the shoe, then Sonny has on a polo with a red stripe on it, and that was completely purposeful. There are no bright, vibrant, cherry reds in the film because I wanted [the sneaker] to be the focal point.” The choice to forgo red until the creation of the Air Jordan wordlessly signals how the innovation of the Nike-Jordan partnership changed the world in small, tangible ways. Whether in sneaker trends or the power dynamic between athletes and brands, “Air” doesn’t just tell us why Michael Jordan matters; it shows the difference he’s made. ",

        "title": "‘Crater’ Review: Scott Mescudi Flatlines Otherwise Cutesy Disney+ Tween Adventure",
        "content": "Within the first four minutes of Disney+ Original film “Crater,” we already have a cavalcade of movie tropes to contend with: dead parents, spaceships, and a 72-hour ticking clock for one newly-orphaned tween to say farewell to his friend group. At least we know Disney hasn’t shied away from its classic storylines.Part “Guardians of the Galaxy” and part “Goonies” with a dash of “Outer Banks,” “Crater” centers on Caleb Channing (a well-cast Isaiah Russell-Bailey), who was raised on a lunar mining colony by his single dad (Scott “Kid Cudi” Mescudi). After the death of his father, Caleb becomes a ward of the state, poised to reap the “death benefits” from his father’s work contract with the colony. As part of said benefits, Caleb is supposed to be put in a cryosleep and transported to distant planet Omega, which takes 75 years to reach.But when a meteor shower warning puts the planet into an unexpected lockdown, he has just 72 hours before the transport is scheduled. Of course, Caleb takes this limited time for one last hurrah with his best friends, Dylan (Billy Barratt), Borney (Orson Hong), and Marcus (Thomas Boyce), and follow his late father’s treasure map to uncharted territory (trope alert: treasure map!).The sweet ensemble friend group is joined by Addison (Mckenna Grace), whom the boys seek out to befriend explicitly for her father’s access to a space rover so they can explore a crater. Sure, there’s cringe green-screen CGI, which makes the kids’ faces mirror “Twilight” icon Renesmee in the space suit helmets, but their adventure away from the adults (cough, cough, the worst part of the film) makes it a worthy escape.Caleb pictures his father in flashbacks, encouraging him to take more road trips that let him “leave everything behind,” like the grief they both endured losing Caleb’s mother. Yet Mescudi had a far better turn in Ti West’s “X”; the actor wavers in a more serious role for “Crater,” especially one of a steady father grappling with a slew of emotions before his own inevitable demise. Caleb and crew were wise to teleport away from him in the script.The freedom of an adolescent friend group existing in their own universe, sans parents (dead) or other adults (threatening to force Caleb away from his friends forever), is well-captured in the coming-of-age movie. It’s believably fun, but best suited for the age group the actors embody. Any older audience member will surely roll their eyes at the spoon-fed cuteness. Yet for a 12-year-old, “Crater” just might feel like shooting for the moon.“Crater” is directed by Kyle Patrick Alvarez, whose experience helming “13 Reasons Why” seems to be on full display with the young actors. Yet the tension displayed in Alvarez’s indie features “Easier with Practice” and “The Stanford Prison Experiment” is nowhere to be seen, outside of a chilly first few minutes when the weight of Caleb’s emotional journey sets in. The film is penned by John Griffin (“From,” “The Twilight Zone”), staying tried and true to the three-act structure with no surprises.In the film’s final moments, Caleb even seems to be part of a teased “Avengers: Endgame”-esque moment, cate of an unexpected reunion with his pals, much like Captain America in the Marvel epic. Yet the film decides to stay more conservative and even more somber. The message is that there’s no going back to the past, and no true reunion with the people you’ve lost, so you might as well enjoy the out-of-this-world adventure while you can.“Crater” is now streaming on Disney+.",

        "title": "Chloé Zhao’s Favorite Movies: 10 Films the Director Likes",
        "content": "When you listen to Chloé Zhao talk about the films that she loves, an obvious pattern emerges. The Oscar-winning director describes her favorite movies by focusing on their scope and the worlds they create. One of her favorite ways to praise a director is by focusing how they approach using their locations: how the tiny details that populate a setting are considered, and how the characters’ interactions with their surroundings establish and reflect their own internal universes.The films that use their locations successfully, in Zhao’s eyes, can vary widely. Some are massive epics like “Lord of the Rings” or “Interstellar,” while others are intimate romantic dramas like “Happy Together” or “Wuthering Heights.” Zhao’s films are often compared to the works of Terrence Malick, and she’s unsurprisingly a big fan of the director’s absorbing and gorgeous works, especially his 2005 historical epic “The New World.” But Zhao’s no snob about the other movies and TV shows she considers her favorites: “Man of Steel” and “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” are among the titles she’s quick to praise.The priority Zhao gives to world-building in film is well reflected in her own work as a director. Across her first three movies — “Songs My Brothers Taught Me,” “The Rider,” and “Nomadland,” which made her the second woman in history to win Best Director at the Oscars — she established herself as a chronicler of the American West, making movies about ordinary people in society’s margins navigating their ordinary troubles. Her first two films both starred non-professional actors, many from South Dakota’s Pine Ridge Lakota Sioux region. “Nomadland” had Oscar winner Frances McDormand in the lead as a widow who travels through the country working seasonal jobs as a nomad, but also featured of real-life modern nomads in its supporting cast. All three films are quiet and contemplative, placing the audience in the often quiet characters’ heads through the way they interact with the exquisite landscapes around them.Those three movies established Zhao as an independent film darling, which made it intriguing when she joined up with Disney to direct “Eternals”: a big-budget superhero space epic and linchpin in Marvel’s Phase 4. The film didn’t become the critical darling that her pedigree promised, but nonetheless, seeing her move her sharp observant style to new subjects and genres remains an intriguing proposition. Zhao’s next film will see her take a stab at a historical romance; based on the book by Maggie O’Farrell, “Hamnet” will focus on the relationship between William Shakespeare and his wife Anne Hathaway (not that Anne Hathaway), and the devastating death of their only son.It’s unclear how long we have to wait for Zhao’s return to the director’s chair, as “Hamnet” is still in pre-production. To bide the time before we can get another one of her movies, why not look at the movies that shaped her into the filmmaker she is? Here is a list of 10 of Zhao’s favorite films, compiled from interviews she’s given over the years and listed in no particular order.In 2022, Zhao spoke with Google TV about her favorite movies and TV shows. One of her choices was “Blade Runner 2049,” Denis Villeneuve’s acclaimed followup to the ’80s cyberpunk classic. Zhao spoke about how the film speaks to her because it transports its audience members to another world. “Every detail, structure, colors, how is this character interacting with the location,” Zhao said. “All of that says so much about that character.” Another pick from Zhao’s Google video was Christopher Nolan’s sci-fi drama “Intersteller,” which she said had a huge impact on her, and was “ahead of its time.” “I didn’t cry the first time I watched it. But between when that film first came out and where we are in the world, as a human being on this planet, I sobbed by the end, this time,” Zhao said. “I think in another 10 years when you watch Interstellar, it’s going to take a whole different meaning about our relationship with the planet, our planet’s relationship with the cosmos, and what’s the destiny of humanity.”  Zhao is a huge fan of the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy by Peter Jackson, but she has a particular love for the second film in the fantasy epic. In her Google interview, she praised the film for its epic scale. “The landscapes, the epic battles, it makes you fall in love with these characters and root for them in their struggles,” Zhao said.  In her Google video, Zhao praised the work of Andrea Arnold, best known for her 2016 Cannes Jury Prize winner “American Honey.” Her favorite movie from the English filmmaker is her 2011 adaptation of “Wuthering Heights,” the classic gothic romance from Emily Brontë.“She has a very strong sense of place. When you watch ‘Wuthering Heights,’ you know this filmmaker isn’t just staring at her actor,” Zhao said. “She’s constantly looking. ‘What else around us can we capture?’ And the way the characters are interacting with this place says so much of their innocence and love for each other.” The one filmmaker that Zhao is most consistently compared to in her career is Terrence Malick, whose luscious use of scenery and meditative stories feel like major influences on Zhao’s own style. Her favorite film from Malick, and one of her favorites overall, is 2005’s “The New World,” which tells the story of the first British settlers in the Americas. Zhao said the film has particular emotional meaning for her because she relates the love story between John Smith (Colin Farrell) and Pocahontas (Q’orianka Kilcher) — who fall for each other despite not speaking the same language — to her own youth, when she left her family in China to live in England and the United States as a teenager.   “I left home and I came to a country where I didn’t speak the language,” Zhao said. “So much of my youth is watching people without understanding what they’re saying. There’s one moment in the film that has such a huge impact on me as a filmmaker, the way that he contrasted [Pocahontas]’s immenint passing with the joyous expression she’s giving. He’s captured an essence about mortality and where we belong.”    In her Google TV interview, Zhao referred to Germany’s Werner Herzog as one of the most important and essential filmmakers to watch. Her favorite film from Herzog is one of his many documentaries: 2011’s “Into the Abyss,” which profiles two Texas men convicted of a triple homicide and given the death penalty. “The film is a heavy subject, but that’s not what the film is about,” Zhao said. “That’s what the genius of Werner Herzog is, it’s always about more. It shows you how much life can shock you, and how magnificent it is to be alive in the most bittersweet way.”  No, it’s not a movie, but Zhao is a full-fledged “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” head. As she puts it in her Google TV video, the classic teen drama that starred Sarah Michelle Geller as the chosen hero against the demons plaguing our mortal world “is a very important show for me.” “It was everything for me, for a few years in college,” Zhao said. “Vampires, witchcraft, teen romance, I mean, what else do you want?” In an interview with USA Today during the 2021 Oscar season, Zhao referred to “Happy Together” as the “film that made me want to make films.” Wong Kar-wai’s 1997 romantic drama stars Leslie Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu-Wai, two of the director’s frequent collaborators, as a gay couple who become stranded in Argentina during a vacation and navigate their loving but tumultuous relationship in the foreign country.  In the same USA Today interview, Zhao revealed that the very first American movie she ever saw, or at least remembers seeing, is James Cameron’s action thriller “The Terminator.” “I was like, ‘Holy (expletive), that looks crazy,'” Zhao said. “Man of Stee,” and the comic book movies of Zack Snyder in general are a bit of a divisive topic on the internet. But Zhao is an unabashed fan of Snyder’s 2013 take on the Superman origin story, and named it a key inspiration for the character of Ikris (Richard Madden) when she was developing her superhero blockbuster “Eternals.” Zhao went as far as to compare Snyder’s gritty take on Superman to the films of her cinematic hero Terrence Malick.   “He approached this myth in an authentic and very real way. I remember thinking it was ‘Superman’ by Terrence Malick when I saw the trailer,” Zhao said. “This film left a strong impression on me.”",

        "title": "‘The Mother’ Review: Jennifer Lopez Is Mother in Niki Caro’s Slick Thriller",
        "content": "Jennifer Lopez may be singlehandedly able to revive the rom-com, but she’s here to remind us she can carry other blockbuster genres: The crime thriller. It’s been awhile since Lopez set her sights on a high-stakes action drama (as she did in Steven Soderbergh’s 1998 hit “Out of Sight”), but clearly she hasn’t forgotten her combat training. Deadly serious with a killer instinct, she is hardly maternal in “The Mother,” a tense thriller about a sharpshooter who must give up her child and go into hiding after double crossing two nefarious exes.Directed by Kiwi filmmaker Niki Caro (“Whale Rider,” “Mulan”), “The Mother” sees two business-savvy women making a mark on the most masculine of genres — and pulling no punches. While it’s far from groundbreaking, “The Mother” is a satisfying nail-biter grounded in a genuine (albeit familiar) emotional setup. Besides, we’ve seen enough violent thrillers about lone wolf fathers protecting their children while the helpless wives sits at home. It’s high time the mothers came out to play — and much more realistic to boot.Lopez’s character is never named in the film; her singleminded mission is defined by her sole identity being “Mother.” The action opens with a pregnant mother in custody with the FBI, where she warns her handler Cruise (Omari Hardwick) that the location is not secure. Ignoring her predictions, the facility is soon under siege from a mercenary group led by her former partner Adrian Lovell (Joseph Fiennes, firmly in his villain era). Luring her one-time lover into a bathroom, he stabs her pregnant belly before a makeshift firebomb surrounds them both in flames. As shower water rains down its protective bubble, the title credits roll.Amazingly, the baby survives, but a tough love FBI agent (Edie Falco, who mysteriously never returns) lays out the hard truth that the only way to protect the child is to terminate her parental rights and put the baby in witness protection. After saving his life in the gunfight, she makes Cruise promise they will find a nice family, and to contact her at the first sign of trouble. Twelve years later, and our thick-skinned heroine is donning deerskin and hunting elk somewhere remote and snowy, her only contact a weathered local named Jons (Paul Raci) who runs the supply shop. When her annual birthday photo from Cruise arrives too early, alarm bells sound.Inventing a fake line-up as a reason to bring her in, Cruise informs her that her daughter’s cover has been blown and she may be in danger. For the first time, she learns her name is Zoe (Lucy Paez) and sets sights on her in the wild. While scoping her out from a safe remove, she happens to witness an abduction in real time, but even she can’t act fast enough to save Zoe from being taken. After an impressive shootout that sees her punching through a rusted-out truck bed to climb into the carriage, she and Cruise hatch a plan to get Zoe back. Adopting aliases, they head to Cuba in search of her other ex-partner, the thinly-sketched but still sketchy Hector Alvarez (Gael Garcia Bernal).It’s a lot of action with not many surprises, but the sharply staged blowouts and chemistry with Cruise add a nice momentum to the predictable proceedings. Doling out her checkered back story in various flashbacks, we learn that Adrian recruited her to work for him during her military training, introducing her to Hector in the meantime.Both men operate by the missive that “powerful people want things that are not on the menu,” and she turns against them both after finding a shipping container full of children amongst the contraband. Though the details are glossed over, it’s clear that she was at one point sleeping with both Hector and Adrian. When Cruise tries to ascertain which man might be most motivated to find Zoe, she replies: “She’s not Hector’s, and she’s not Adrian’s. She’s mine.”It’s a hell of a lot of setup to get what becomes the real meat of the drama: The time she spends with Zoe back in her remote woodsy cabin. Determined to teach Zoe to protect herself, Mother runs a tight training regimen of target practice, hand to hand combat, and wilderness survival. A wolf mother and her pack of cubs may be a heavy-handed metaphor, but it gets the job done (and it’s a pretty impressive feat of animal handling.) Though her inability to connect with Zoe emotionally doesn’t quite pack the dramatic punch the film needs, the lull in the tension is well-paced within the narrative, and the culminating action scene delivers on the requisite thrills. It’s not quite a Bond movie, but some very agile snowmobile drivers keep things exciting.Some well-placed needle drops feature fittingly eclectic artists, including Maluma, Grimes, Maxwell, and Portishead, and do a lot to further the movie’s claim as a stylish woman’s riff on a macho genre. As she did the with live-action “Mulan,” Caro proves herself adept at staging large-scale action scenes with intriguing creative flourishes. Sure, the writing contains some groan-worthy cliches, like when mother asserts that not feeling is “the only way to survive,” but they are far less offensive than in your average action thriller. If they can look past their own internal biases, “The Mother” should satisfy even the most diehard action fans, while leaving the door to some new ones.“The Mother” starts streaming on Netflix on Friday, May 12.",

        "title": "Michael J. Fox on How ‘Once Upon a Time in Hollywood’ in Part Inspired Him to Retire",
        "content": "Michael J. Fox had to look back to the future to decide on his own retirement.The “Back to the Future” icon explained to Empire magazine (via Screen Rant) that Quentin Tarantino‘s 1960s set “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” inspired him to seriously consider stepping away from acting. Fox detailed that on “The Good Wife” spinoff “The Good Fight,” he had trouble remembering his lines due to his Parkinson’s disease.“I thought of ‘Once Upon A Time In Hollywood.’ There’s a scene where Leonardo DiCaprio’s character can’t remember his lines anymore. He goes back to his dressing room and he’s screaming at himself in the mirror. Just freaking insane,” Fox said. “I had this moment where I was looking in the mirror and thought, ‘I cannot remember it anymore. Well, let’s move on.’ It was peaceful.”Fox is set to receive the Museum of Moving Image’s Lifetime Achievement Award in June 2023. Among his accolades, Fox has won five Emmys, four Golden Globes, one Grammy, two Screen Actors Guild awards, the People’s Choice award, and GQ Man of the Year honor. In 2000, he launched the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research, which is now the leading Parkinson’s organization in the world. To date, the foundation has raised over $1.5 billion.The actor admitted in April 2023 that “every day gets tougher” with his illness. ““You don’t die from Parkinson’s, you die with Parkinson’s. So I’ve been thinking of the mortality of it,” Fox said. “I’m not going to be 80.”Fox charts his own health journey in documentary “STILL: A Michael J. Fox Movie,” which debuted at 2023 Sundance. Directed by “An Inconvenient Truth” helmer David Guggenheim, the film captures Fox’s career after being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease at age 30. “Every tremor is like a seismic jolt. But he never says, ‘look at how I’ve suffered,'” Guggenheim exclusively told IndieWire’s Anne Thompson about working with Fox. “He went through hell that year [during production]. More time in the emergency room than at home. And, and yet he never bitched or complained, you know? ‘Dude, you gotta at least, let me teach you how to talk about your pain. Because I’m really good at that.’ He just doesn’t want to be pitied. He says, ‘pity is a benign form of abuse.'”",

        "title": "‘Hypnotic’ Review: Ben Affleck Navigates the World’s Silliest Conspiracy Like an Absolute Champ",
        "content": "Find someone who looks at you the way Ben Affleck looks at genres that peaked in the ‘90s. His ongoing quest to save the middlebrow movie has seen him try his hand at everything from big budget sports dramas to old school erotic thrillers in recent years as he tries to prove that entertaining adults is still a noble goal.His latest role, which finds him starring in in Robert Rodriguez’s “Hypnotic,” is a similar throwback to the kind of nonsensically complex, star-driven thrillers that could be instantly forgotten before enjoying a long DVD shelf life in 2002. If TBS launched its own airline and started producing original films designed to be viewed on two hour commuter flights, this would be an ideal first project. The elevator pitch for “Hypnotic” may well have been, “Take ‘Inception,’ strip it of any serious artistry and nuance, cram as many twists as humanly possible into 90 minutes, and make it fucking rule.” It feels like an utterly ridiculous film before you hit the multitude of twists that blow up its already-shaky premise a dozen times over. But at a certain point, the film’s commitment to its own asininity becomes so overpowering that even the most cynical viewers will have no choice but to suspend their disbelief and be sucked into its magic. Danny Rourke (Affleck) is a very sad cop. He hasn’t been himself since the day his daughter Minnie (Hala Finley) was kidnapped at a park in Austin, and he spends his days being tortured by his inability to find the bastard who did it. The only thing keeping him sane is solving the occasional crime. When the department gets an anonymous tip about a bank robbery that’s about to go down, Danny smoothly intercepts coded messages and figures out that four goons are attempting to steal a safety deposit box. He gets to the box before they do and finds that it contains a picture of his daughter with the words “Find Lev Dellrayne” written on it. We soon learn that Lev Dellrayne (William Fichtner) is the world’s greatest hypnotic. As the name suggests, hypnotics are mental savants who can control other people’s minds and get them to do virtually anything by altering their perceptions of reality. Dellrayne has recently escaped from a top secret prison designed to house dangerous hypnotics, and his ability to perform mental gymnastics on all but the most powerful minds makes him virtually unstoppable. Danny becomes convinced that Dellrayne orchestrated his daughter’s kidnapping, and his determination to steal the photo of her makes him think that she’s still alive somewhere. He teams up with local tarot card reader and fellow hypnotic Diana Cruz (Alice Braga) to track down Dellrayne by working with a series of underground hackers and spies that comprise the hypnotic community. But nothing is ever as it seems, as Dellrayne is constantly fucking with their heads by making them believe they’re in different places than they actually are. Things keep getting more and more meta as they try to peel back the layers of deception and figure out why the hypnotics are so obsessed with Danny’s daughter. Rodriguez has always done his best work outside the confines of the studio system, and this independently-financed project is the kind of messy work of genius that you get when you let great artists cook. But as charming as Rodriguez’s script might be, his real stroke of genius was casting the only actor on the planet who could make this movie work. “Hypnotic” was simply destined to be a Ben Affleck movie. The role of Danny allows Affleck to show off all his signature moves — zoning out in a cloud of sadness while still looking insanely handsome, telling his subordinates to stop telling dumb jokes with one stern look, and ultimately pulling himself off the mat and getting his act together when he realizes that there’s more to life than just brooding.This canny casting also works because Affleck’s chaotic career trajectory has given him an unprecedented ability to split the difference between highbrow and lowbrow entertainment. To avoid being dismissed as direct-to-VOD trash, “Hypnotic” needed a legitimate A-lister with unimpeachable movie star gravitas to lead it. But watching Brad Pitt talking about a hacker’s homemade Mountain Dew recipe would just be stupid. Danny Rourke is a role that needed to be played by a man who made “Argo” and went viral for his sad Dunkin’ Donuts runs. Affleck’s ability to simultaneously occupy the roles of lauded auteur and cultural rodeo clown made him the ideal man for the job. It’s hard to imagine a throwback like “Hypnotic” making much of a cultural impact during its theatrical run — but how many of these movies ever did? Its real moment in the sun will come ten years from now, when some film student is perusing the $2 DVD section of his local record store. “Hypnotic” probably won’t even be in there, but another sweaty customer will tap him on the shoulder and say that he’s selling a bunch of other DVDs for $1 in the parking lot. They’ll walk outside, the kid will trade a mostly-used Subway gift card for the man’s copy of “Hypnotic,” and he’ll have the time of his goddamn life watching it.Ketchup Entertainment will release “Hypnotic” in theaters on Friday, May 12.",

        "title": "Maïwenn Confirms She Assaulted a French Journalist Ahead of ‘Jeanne du Barry’ Cannes Premiere",
        "content": "French writer/director/actress Maïwenn, née Maïwenn Lo Besco, has admitted to assaulting a journalist amid an ongoing lawsuit.The “Jeanne du Barry” director and star is the subject of legal action taken by Edwy Plenel, the editor-in-chief of Mediapart magazine. Plenel alleged Maïwenn pulled his hair and spat in his face while dining at a Paris restaurant. The reporter filed a police report on March 7 and cited that the encounter took place in late February.In a new live TV interview on nightly talk show “Quotidien,” Maïwenn addressed the assault allegations.“Can you confirm? Can you say more?” host Yann Barthès asked the filmmaker (via Deadline).“Can I confirm that I assaulted him, or that I received a complaint?” Maïwenn responded before clarifying, “I didn’t receive a complaint. I learned about it in the press.”Barthès inquired, “And did you assault him?”Maïwenn said, “Yes,” before sidestepping the details. “Nice try, but it’s not the moment for me to talk about it. I’ll talk about it when it’s the right moment. I am very anxious about the launch of my film,” she concluded.Maïwenn’s “Jeanne du Barry” is opening the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Controversial actor Johnny Depp stars as Louis XV, with Maïwenn playing his titular lover. She said that she did not “hesitate” to cast Depp in the role despite the domestic violence allegations shared by ex-wife Amber Heard.“Very quickly I said, he lost the first trial, he won the second,” Maïwenn explained. “We could say it was one person’s word against another. I didn’t feel I had the right to judge.”She admitted to not wanting to come across like a “groupie” when first meeting with Depp to discuss the film prior to his casting.“I gathered myself for five minutes beforehand to make sure I didn’t go in with ‘a groupie’ head but rather a director head, to really see if I could see him in the role,” she shared. “I only spoke French…He was fantastic in the film. He was really invested. He speaks really good French and knows all of French history.”Cannes festival director Thierry Fremaux stood by the “Jeanne du Barry” as the opening night film, saying in April, “I don’t see Maïwenn’s film as a controversial choice at all, because if Johnny Depp had been banned from working it would have been different, but that’s not the case. We only know one thing, it’s the justice system and I think he won the legal case. But the movie isn’t about Johnny Depp.”",

        "content": "Charlize Theron thinks anyone who opposes drag is a monster.The “Monster” Oscar winner and “Fast X” star participated in a “Drag Isn’t Dangerous” telethon alongside Elizabeth Banks, Jesse Eisenberg, Billy Eichner, Sarah Silverman, Adam Lambert, Marcia Gay Harden, and more LGBTQ+ allies. Theron vowed to “fuck anybody up” who is against drag queens in response to proposed bills in states like Tennessee, Kentucky, and Montana banning public drag performances.“We love you, queens. We’re in your corner and we’ve got you,” Theron said in a video. “I will fuck anybody up who’s trying to fuck with anything with you guys. There are so many things that are hurting and, really, killing our kids, and we all know what I’m talking about right now and it ain’t no drag queen.”Theron continued, “If you’ve ever seen a drag queen lip-sync for her life, it only makes you happier, it only make you love more, it makes you a better person. Please support all the great organizations that are out there helping all of this nonsense go away like it should. All of these incredibly stupid policies. Bye! No more room for hate, only love, and love equals drag queens!”Opposition to drag bans has become an increasingly popular topic in Hollywood. Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick recently shared their support in a viral TikTok video with the caption, “Drag bans are bad karma.”“Drag performers and the LGBTQIA+ community need our help,” the video stated. “Tap the link in my bio to shop the #SixDegreesOfKB campaign supporting the @aclu Drag Defense Fund in the nationwide effort to protect creative expression or make a gift.” The couple also wore matching t-shirts reading: “Drag is an art and drag is a right.”“RuPaul’s Drag Race” stars Kerri Colby — who was the first trans woman on the cast — and Bosco exclusively reflected in an IndieWire interview on what the reality competition series means in this current political climate.“Everything has an evolution, just like how so many of us found who we are by finding our drag persona,” Colby said to IndieWire’s Jude Dry. “Especially coming out of the pandemic…I think it was only the appropriate decision to have such a trans-inclusive cast…because drag and the LGBTQ experience is a progressive state of the human race, but with a show that represents it and is the stamp of queer approval.”Bosco added, “With drag in particular transness comes up all the time. It’s a very organic part of the sport, a lot of self-discovery goes into drag. And for a lot of us, we find our transitions through our art. And I’m really, really happy that our season got to showcase that and we got to be a part of that.”new! ✨ charlize theron during her participation today (07), in the program \"drag isn't dangerous\". pic.twitter.com/VsxGme5VQv",

        "title": "Ruben Östlund Gets Why Scorsese Doesn’t Want ‘Killers’ in Competition at Cannes: It’s More of a ‘Risk’",
        "content": "Ruben Östlund is aware that the Cannes critics can resemble a circle of sadness.The two-time Palme d’Or winner and “Triangle of Sadness” director admitted to Variety that he understands why Martin Scorsese declined to debut “Killers of the Flower Moon” in competition at Cannes. Östlund serves as the 2023 Cannes Film Festival jury president.“You have to use the competition to gain energy. And think of how much energy the Cannes Film Festival has given to filmmakers all over the world,” Östlund said. “Of course, if you’re a director of the caliber of Martin Scorsese, to be in competition with other films involves a risk rather than a reward — critics in Cannes can be harsh.”He added, “But I would like to encourage everybody to enter the competition.”Scorsese’s long-awaited “Killers of the Flower Moon” is premiering at this year’s festival; however, the Western epic true crime period piece will play out of competition, similar to “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.”The official logline for “Killers of the Flower Moon” bills it as a 1920s Oklahoma drama depicting the serial murder of members of the oil-wealthy Osage Nation that became known as the Reign of Terror. Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone, Jesse Plemons, Brendan Fraser, Robert De Niro, Tantoo Cardinal, Cara Jade Myers, JaNae Collins, and Jillian Dion star.Cannes festival director Thierry Fremaux confirmed that the film was eligible to debut in competition due to its theatrical release from Apple, in partnership with Paramount Pictures. Fremaux told Variety earlier this year that he wanted Scorsese to compete for the Palme d’Or almost a half-century since “Taxi Driver.”“When we saw the film back in November and when we invited it, it was an Apple movie. The situation has changed now that Apple has announced that it will be released in theaters everywhere, including in France, on Oct. 19. That means it qualifies for the Cannes competition since, as you know, all films competing must have a theatrical release,” Fremaux said. “So I told Apple and Martin Scorsese that considering how great the movie is, it’s obviously invited in competition. And now I’m waiting to hear their decision. We have until the last minute.”He continued, “When Fellini won the Palme d’Or for ‘La Dolce Vita,’ he said ‘I’m not coming back in competition,’ and Marty won the Palme d’Or in 1976. So obviously one could say, he doesn’t have much to gain considering his prestigious status. Except one thing: the Palme d’Or. I think he should come in competition.”Fremaux further teased that “Killers of the Flower Moon” is akin to David Lean and Cecil B. DeMille Old Hollywood classics. Scorsese has yet to publicly comment on whether the film will be in competition or not at Cannes. For all the details on “Killers of the Flower Moon,” click here.",

        "title": "‘Poor Things’ Teaser: Emma Stone Is Undead in Yorgos Lanthimos’ Latest",
        "content": "Emma Stone transforms into a “Frankenstein”-esque lead for Yorgos Lanthimos‘ latest film “Poor Things.”Stone and Lanthimos continue their partnership following “The Favourite” and short film “Bleat.” Stone is also confirmed to be cast in Lanthimos’ “AND” feature.For “Poor Things,” Stone leads a Frankenstein-inspired tale of second chances. Per the official synopsis, the film centers on the incredible tale and fantastical evolution of Bella Baxter (Stone), a young woman brought back to life by the brilliant and unorthodox scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe). Under Baxter’s protection, Bella is eager to learn. Hungry for the worldliness she is lacking, Bella runs off with Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), a slick and debauched lawyer, on a whirlwind adventure across the continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella grows steadfast in her purpose to stand for equality and liberation.“Poor Things” is based on Scottish author Alasdair Gray’s novel about a woman who drowns herself to escape her abusive husband and is resurrected with the brain of her unborn child. The film is written by “The Great” showrunner Tony McNamara, who also penned Lanthimos’ last film “The Favourite.”Ramy Youssef, Christopher Abbott, Margaret Qualley, and Jerrod Carmichael also star. Lanthimos praised “Poor Things” actor Dafoe’s commitment to the role, saying, “That’s what you want from actors, to want to be part of it in any way.”Lanthimos re-teams with editor Yorgos Mavropsaridis, with “Poor Things” produced by Lanthimos, Stone, Ed Guiney, Ali Herting, Andrew Lowe, and Dave McCary. Ildiko Kemeny, Kasia Malipan, and David Minkowski serve as co-producers.Lanthimos previously told The Guardian in 2018 that he hoped to push Stone further as an actress. “I don’t think she’s out of her comfort zone yet – she has a lot of room there,” the “Killing of a Sacred Deer” actor said. “I’m not sure how I knew that, but I kind of knew it. She was very confident from the beginning – physically, she was immediately on it from the rehearsals.”He added of helming provocative films with central female leads, “I can’t pretend that I thought we need more women represented in a certain way, it was just an instinctive thing. I was interested in that which I hadn’t seen very often.”“Poor Things” premieres September 8 in theaters from Searchlight. Check out the teaser below.",

        "title": "‘My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3’ Trailer: Nia Vardalos Heads to Greece",
        "content": "How do you top not one but two Big Fat Greek Weddings? By having a Big Fat Greek Wedding that’s actually in Greece. Focus Features released the first trailer for “My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3″ this Thursday, seeing the Portokalos family head off to the motherland.First released in 2002, the original “My Big Fat Greek Wedding” tells the story of Toula Portokalos (Nia Vardalos), a Greek woman in Chicago who falls in love and gets engaged to WASPy Ian Miller (John Corbett, who’s reprising another of his iconic early 2000s rom-com roles this year in Season 2 of “And Just Like That”), but struggles to deal with her large Greek family during the wedding planning process. 2016 brought the film’s first sequel, which focused on Toula and Ian’s life as parents and a second wedding between Toula’s parents Maria (Lainie Kazan) and Gus (the late Michael Constantine).The third film picks up with Toula and her family after the passing of Gus, whose last wish was for his children to visit his childhood village in Greece. The whole family packs their bags for a vacation to the country, as Toula attempts to track down her dad’s childhood best friends, the grown-ups reconnect with their roots, and Toula’s aunt Theia (Andrea Martin) plays matchmaker with teenage Paris (Elena Kampouris) and tagalong Aristotle (Elias Kacavas).The original “My Big Fat Greek Wedding” was a major sleeper hit when it was first released, making $368.7 million worldwide on a minuscule $5 million budget, despite never reaching No. 1 at the box office during its theatrical run. It remains the highest-grossing rom-com domestically, making $241.4 million in North America. (It’s also the highest-grossing film in the history of IFC Films, earning about 10 times what the next highest, “Boyhood,” did, and considered by some to be the highest-grossing independent film ever.) The film was also positively received by critics, netting Vardalos an Oscar nod for Best Original Screenplay.Vardalos takes over the director’s chair for the third film, in addition to penning the screenplay again. Corbett, Martin, Kazan, and Kampouris also star with Louis Mandylor, Gia Carides, Joey Fatone, Maria Vacratsis, and Melina Kotselo. Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, and Gary Goetzman all return from the first two films to produce the third installment; Paul Brooks, Scott Niemeyer, and Steven Shareshian serve as executive producers. Focus Features will release the film in the U.S., and Universal Pictures International will distribute the film internationally.“My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3” heads down the (movie theater) aisle September 8.

        "title": "Cannes 2023: 20 Most Anticipated Films Playing at This Year’s Festival",
        "content": "The red carpets are being rolled out, the rosé is being chilled, and the biggest names in international cinema are getting ready to converge on France for this year’s Cannes Film Festival. After a stellar return to form with last year’s event, which followed a delayed and truncated 2021 festival and a totally cancelled 2020 edition, the circuit’s starriest annual event seems ready to deliver another enviable selection of some of the year’s best (or, at least, destined to be) films.This year’s festival includes new films from some of cinema’s biggest names, including Martin Scorsese, Wes Anderson, Todd Haynes, Ken Loach, and even (well, sort of) Jean-Luc Godard. There are big studio efforts on offer (“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” “Elemental”) and new features from some of our favorite auteurs (a staggering assortment, including Wim Wenders, Alice Rohrwacher, Jonathan Glazer, Hirokazu Kore-eda, Jessica Hausner, Aki Kaurismaki, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, Catherine Breillat, and so many more).There’s also already plenty of controversy afoot, from the programming of Maïwenn’s Johnny Depp-starring “Jeanne du Barry” as the fest’s opener to the inclusion of The Weeknd and Sam Levinson’s embattled new series “The Idol.” In better news, records have already been broken, with the fest’s competition slate including an all-time of seven films directed by women. And this thing hasn’t even started yet!Digging through the Cannes lineup is always a treat, fueled by those initial big names and trundled along by the continued discovery of brand new films and filmmakers to get excited about. This year is no different, with a lineup that offers up new thrills with each subsequent perusal. To help make sense of such a rich lineup, we’ve selected 20 films we’re most excited about seeing on the Croisette and sharing with you post-haste.This year’s festival run May 16 — 27, and you can check out all of our coverage of it right here, with much more to come.Anne Thompson, Ryan Lattanzio, and Jude Dry also contributed to this article. Turkish filmmaker Nuri Bilge Ceylan will challenge and hopefully enthrall audiences once again with another three-plus-hour epic, “About Dry Grasses,” at Cannes. Back in 2014, he won the Palme d’Or for his beautifully realized drama about a retired actor’s existential crisis, “Winter Sleep,” while remaining best acclaimed for his searching 2011 crime drama “Once Upon a Time in Anatolia.”  This one has a timely hook that could set off great debate in France. Starring Deniz Celiloğlu, Merve Dizdar, and Musab Ekici, competition title “About Dry Grasses” centers on a young teacher eking out a living in rural Anatolia under compulsory service who eyes an assignment in Istanbul amid harassment accusations from two female students. Five of Ceylan’s features have been submitted for the International Oscar. Expect jury president Ruben Östlund to pay close attention to this film from a globally celebrated auteur who has yet to deliver a disappointment. —RL Justine Triet’s fourth feature has long seemed like a natural pick for this year’s Cannes: all of her features have shown at the festival and, in 2019, she leveled up to competition status with her prickly dramedy “Sibyl.” Her next film, “Anatomy of a Fall,” will also compete for the Palme d’Or amongst a starry assortment of new features.The film continues Triet’s interest in following characters thrust into situations in which they must battle forces much bigger than themselves. This time, Triet’s star will go up against both the French legal system and her own moral code, as the film follows lauded “Toni Erdmann” star Sandra Hüller as a woman accused of murder after her husband dies in a strange fall. (The Cannes synopsis bills the trial itself as nothing less than “a veritable dissection of [the] relationship.”)The only person who might save her? Her blind son, who starts to doubt her innocence as the trial unfolds. Hüller is always worth watching, and paired with the gimlet eye of Triet, “Anatomy of a Fall” isn’t just one of our most anticipated Cannes features, it’s one of the year’s most thrilling filmmaker and actor combinations. —KEFrance may have an outsized influence on Wes Anderson, but his adopted home — where he’s spent much of his time since 2005 — has also given the filmmaker’s imagination easy access to the rest of Europe, which comes in handy even when he’s telling stories that take place in the United States.Set in a fictional American desert town but shot against the sand-dusted expanses of Chinchón, Spain, “Asteroid City” transports us back to a Junior Stargazer convention in 1955, where students and parents from across the country gather together in the middle of nowhere to look up and see what they can find in the night sky (judging by the “Moonrise Kingdom” meets “Nope” vibe of the trailer, we’re guessing it’s probably aliens). The cast is immense even by the filmmaker’s usual standards, boasting a constellation of stars that finds first-timers like Tom Hanks and Margot Robbie joining Anderson regulars like Tilda Swinton and Jason Schwartzman. —DEThis year’s Cannes competition is loaded with veteran filmmakers, but there’s one major exception. “Banel and Adama” stands out as the only directorial debut in the section, a major feat given how often first features wind up in Un Certain Regard or other areas of selection before filmmakers “graduate” to the competition ranks. (The last movie to debut to premiere in competition was in 2018.)French-Senegelese director Ramata-Toulaye Sy’s intriguing drama holds a lot of potential to make some noise at the festival this year, as the movie focuses on a young Senegelese couple (Khady Mane and Mamadou Diallo) whose relationship runs into problems with the traditions of their provincial community. Shot in local language of Pulaar, the movie follows Sy’s award-winning short “Astel,” which centered on the experiences of a 13-year-old Senegelese girl. Her new work is poised to establish her as a major African talent as the continent aims to gain more traction around the world. —EKFor her fourth narrative feature, Italian auteur Alice Rohrwacher sets her latest narrative in the rich world of archeological looters, known in Italian as tomboroli, or tomb robbers. Filmed in Southern Tuscany and set in the 1980s, “La Chimera” stars Josh O’Connor as a British archaeologist who becomes embroiled in an international network of Etruscan artifact thieves. The film also stars Isabella Rossellini as a retired opera singer, the filmmaker’s sister Alba Rohrwacher, Brazilian actress Carol Duarte, and “Martin Eden” star Vincenzo Nemolato.Rohrwacher has said that “La Chimera” is the final piece in a triptych about Italian identity and the country’s reckoning with the past, which began with her 2014 Grand Prix winner “The Wonders” and continued in “Happy as Lazzaro,” which took home best screenplay at Cannes in 2018. Neon scooped up international rights to the film ahead of its Cannes premiere, which should signal a measure of broad appeal. O’Connor’s popularity with Italians will also see him starring in Luca Guadagnino’s hotly anticipated “Challengers,” which is set for a September release. —JDCannes regular Hausner seems like an obvious pick to return to Cannes — her previous feature, “Little Joe,” played in competition in 2019 and won star Emily Beecham the fest’s Best Actress award, and all of her previous films, save for Venice premiere “Lourdes,” have debuted on the Croissette. Her latest, which again returns her to the competition slate, is filled with intrigue. The film, Hausner’s second English-language effort, stars Mia Wasikowska as a young teacher who takes a gig at a tony prep school, where she forms a strong — and eventually dangerous — bond with five of her students.In March 2021, Hausner told Screen that the film is “a lot about eating — eating disorders and eating behavior.” Its official Cannes synopsis lets on even more: Miss Novak arrives at the institution to teach a “conscious eating class. She instructs that eating less is healthy.” By the time the rest of the school’s adults catch wind of what’s happening, it may be too late, and her grip on the impressionable youngsters might be too far gone. Sounds eerily topical. —KEArgentina is no stranger to great heist movies, but it’s been almost 25 years since “Nine Queens,” and about time another one delivered the goods. The potential breakout status is strong for Un Certain Regard entry “The Delinquents,” filmmaker Rodrigo Moreno’s pitch-black look at a man who robs the bank where he works with the intention of hiding the money until he’s released. In the process, he coerces a coworker into the scheme, and both men are forced to deal with the fallout as thrilling and comical twists unfold (including a most unexpected love triangle).With the expert tonal shifts of a great Coen brothers crime odyssey and unnerving tension reminiscent of Claude Chabrol, the Un Certain Regard premiere is likely to deliver one of the buzzier crowdpleasers of the section. —EKSix years have passed since the great Finnish deadpan filmmaker Aki Kaurismaki’s “The Other Side of Hope,” and his work is always a welcome addition to a festival showcasing the greatest auteurs working today. Kaurismaki’s films are sad comedies with glimmers of unexpected uplift, as he tracks the experiences of lost souls and outcasts looking for some measure of meaing in their lives.“Fallen Leaves” promises more of just that, as the Helsinki romance reportedly follows a young supermarket worker who falls in love with an alcoholic as they both struggle to find stability and happiness in their solitary world. There are elements of Kaurismaki career-highs “Match Factory Girl” and “Ariel” in this premise, but those movies came out decades ago, and Kaurismaki deserves another shot to remind audiences of his poignant and comical skills. Here’s hoping that he delivers exactly that. —EK Filmmaker Joanna Arnow’s first feature since 2015’s “i hate myself :)” is the kind of scrappy, no-frills American indie that almost plays like it was designed to prove scrappy, no-frills American indies still exist. The director stars as a wayward New Yorker in a hapless cycle of BDSM relationships in which playing the submissive gives her some measure of catharsis from the grind of her boring day job. A deadpan sex comedy designed both cringe-worthy and soulful in its vision of modern-day malaise, the movie promises to deliver some genuine DIY spirit to this year’s Directors Fortnight.The movie also boasts Sean Baker as an executive producer, and like the “Red Rocket” filmmaker’s uncompromising ability to blend sexual discomfort and extreme self-loathing with unexpected pathos, “The Feeling That the Time For Doing Something Has Passed” should make the case that at least one other director can pull off that balance just as well. —EKBrazilian filmmaker Karim Ainouz’s first English-language film stars Oscar winner Alicia Vikander (“The Danish Girl”) as canny survivor Catherine Parr, the sixth and last wife of Henry VIII (Jude Law). Based on the 2013 novel “The Queen’s Gambit” by Elizabeth Fremantle, this feminist psychological thriller tracks the machinations of the English Court: Parr is romantically entangled with Thomas Seymour (Sam Riley) when she catches the eye of the king, still desperately seeking a male heir. But, after she marries him, Parr helps to make Princesses Mary and Elizabeth eligible to inherit the throne. This sales title could be Oscar bait for one of the top specialty distributors. —ATAlready snapped up by MUBI prior to its Un Certain Regard premiere, and boasting an attention-grabbing title that’s sure to make it one of the sidebar’s hottest tickets, Molly Manning Walker’s “How to Have Sex” definitely wants you to think you’re in for a fun romp about three teenage girls trying to get laid during a bacchanalian holiday on the Greek island of Malia — its horned up heroines sure do.Unfortunately for this trio of long-time besties, they were born into a movie that takes place in the real world, and their whirlwind drinkathon will test their livers, their friendships, and even their protean self-identities by the time it spits them back out. Fresh off her fantastic work as the cinematographer on the Sundance breakout “Scrapper,” Walker takes a seat in the director’s chair for what promises to be a sensitive and sobering debut feature — one that dives headfirst into those legendary spring break nights, but also isn’t afraid to re-examine them in the cold light of day. —DEYou can’t keep an iconic on-screen adventurer down for long these days, particularly one who is a) played by an actor who has made no bones about his continued adoration for the character and b) so ripe for some snazzy, technologically-aided updates to his classic visage. Harrison Ford may have already bought back his Indiana Jones for one last ride already, but it seems like he (and the rest of the Indy team, plus newbie franchise director James Mangold) were just as bummed about “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” as most movie-goers and are eager to close out (for real this time!) with one more giddy adventure.Little is known about “Dial of Destiny” except that it will toggle between a late ’60s setting and flashbacks to World War II — all the better so Indy can fight the Nazis in classic “Raiders” and “Last Crusade” fashion — powered by CGI youthening techniques first pioneered in “TRON: Legacy” and “The Irishman.” The film also stars Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Antonio Banderas, John Rhys-Davies (Sallah from “Raiders” and “Last Crusade”!), Toby Jones, Boyd Holbrook, Ethann Isidore, and Mads Mikkelsen. And with a starry May 18 premiere date on the books, it seems no secret that this is one Cannes-minted blockbuster to greatly anticipate. —KEPerhaps no Cannes title comes freighted with more expectation than Martin Scorsese’s latest three-hour epic, uniting in one movie — for the first time — the filmmaker’s two favorite stars, Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. They play uncle and nephew in this tragic 1920s American saga adapted by Oscar winner Eric Roth (“Forrest Gump”) from David Grann’s non-fiction bestseller.The book chronicles the insidious plot by a white Oklahoma family to steal the wealth of the Osage Nation, which was given oil-rich land by the American government. Jesse Plemons is the dogged FBI man who is determined to solve the mystery of a string of inexplicable murders, a part originally slated for DiCaprio. But at his behest, Roth beefed up the role of the more complex Ernest Burkhart, who is married to an Osage woman (Lily Gladstone) who wants to live. Apple TV+ plans to release the $200-million feature in theaters in October via Paramount Pictures. —ATFor revered French filmmaker Catherine Breillat’s first new film in 10 years, she chose to remake the Danish erotic drama “Queen of Hearts,” written and directed by May el-Toukhy. The 2019 Danish film was a critical darling that won nine of the Danish Film Academy’s Robert Awards, including Best Danish Film. With references to Lewis Carroll’s “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland,” the story follows a middle-aged woman embroiled in a forbidden affair with her teenage stepson.Fresh off her turn in the Oscar-nominated drama “Close,” French actress Léa Drucker plays the lead in the French remake, starring alongside theater actors Olivier Rabourdin and Clotilde Cournau. Never one to avoid controversy, it’s no surprise the provocative source material inspired Breillat, a master of showing women’s sexuality in all of its messy complications. Though certainly a gamble, it remains to be seen if the hot-button subject of “Last Summer” is the right container to revive her somewhat tarnished reputation. —JDWe’re in weird times when a new Todd Haynes film premiering at Cannes is still up for sale, but don’t expect this one to stay on the shelf for long: “May/December” stars Natalie Portman and Julianne, destined to bring star wattage to Croisette photocalls, star in this “Persona”-esque drama about the ripple effect of a tabloid romance that once gripped the nation. Now, 20 years after the romance sparked, Gracie Atherton-Yu (Julianne Moore) and her husband Joe (23 years her junior and played by “Riverdale” heartthrob Charles Melton) are preparing for the empty nest as their twins graduate high school. Meanwhile, a less-veteran Hollywood actress, Elizabeth (Natalie Portman), comes to their Southern home to better understand Gracie before playing her in a film. Very soon, the women’s identities become oddly entangled as family dynamics rip apart. “May/December” filmed last year in Georgia with cinematographer Christopher Blauvelt stepping in for Haynes pal Ed Lachman, who left the project after an injury. The drama reunites Haynes with his longtime collaborator Moore, who brought worried elegance to his classics “Safe” and “Far from Heaven” as suburban women in crisis before also starring as an actress in Haynes’ “Wonderstruck.” All eyes — cinephiles and buyers alike — will be on this one ahead of its competition premiere mere hours before Martin Scorsese drops “Killers of the Flower Moon” on Cannes that same night. —RL The prolific Hirokazu Kore-eda has been a bit off his game since winning the Palme d’Or for “Shoplifters” in 2018, as neither “The Truth” nor last year’s “Broker” were up to par with his best work. But you can’t keep one of the greats down for long, and Kore-eda is already back in the fold with another Palme contender, albeit one that he didn’t script himself (a rarity for the auteur, who’s self-generated every one of his films since his 1995 debut, “Maboroshi”).Written by TV writer Yuji Sakamoto, and starring “Shoplifters” breakout Sakura Ando as a single mother who starts to believe that something is very wrong with her teenage son — and gets more than she bargained for after she demands answers from the kid’s high school teacher — “Monster” seems to find the warm and fuzzy Kore-eda returning to the darker territory that defined the likes of “Distance” and “The Third Murder.” The film’s score will feature contributions from the late Ryuichi Sakamoto, who sent Kore-eda two original piano compositions before his death in March. —DEMexican director Amat Escalante lit a firecracker on the Croisette in 2013, winning best director for “Heli,” a controversial and very violent thriller about a factory worker up against a corrupt police force while in the crosshairs of a vicious drug war. His 2016 sci-fi horror film “The Untamed,” tearing from “Possession’s” pages in centering on a couple driven to psychosexual madness by a creature dropped in their town by a meteorite, skipped Cannes for Venice but won the Italian festival’s Silver Lion for directing.  After trying his hand at directing episodes of Netflix’s “Narcos: Mexico,” the former Carlos Reygadas protégé is back in cinemas with “Perdidos en la Noche” (“Lost in the Night”), a last-minute addition to the Cannes Premiere section out of competition. It follows a young man named Emiliano (Juan Daniel García Treviño) living in a small Mexican mining town, looking to avenge the disappearance of his activist mother. Without help from the justice system, his journey leads him on the path to a wealthy family with secrets of their own, and possible romance amid the chaos. Any Escalante film is a tough vision you can’t ignore, and it’s worth noting that his 2013 “Heli” directing prize came from a jury led by Steven Spielberg. —RL Chilean director Felipe Galvez’s first feature follows a trio of horsemen in Patagonia circa 1901 hired by an wealthy landlord to mark the perimeter of his territory. With the expedition comprised of a Chilean with mixed heritage, an American, and a Brit, the scenario reportedly devolves into a violent meditation on the country’s colonialist past as the group is tasked with hunting down an indigenous figure who refuses to leave his land.Galvez, whose 2018 short film “Rapaz” played at Cannes’ Critics Week sidebar, has been developing this ambitious feature debut for years in between editing gigs. Among several Latin American films poised to help the continent make a post-pandemic comeback this year, “The Settlers” may end up as the most impactful of the bunch. —EKCannes regular Pedro Almodóvar’s second English-language film, like the first, “The Human Voice” (2020), is a short film. When “Brokeback Mountain” was getting set up almost 20 years ago, the Spanish auteur considered directing that seminal gay Western, but turned down the chance out of fear that he would not have creative freedom. He’s now making his own gay Western on his own terms.This time, the director filmed in the desert in Spain favored by spaghetti Westerns his story of two middle-aged men, a sheriff (Ethan Hawke) and a rancher (Pedro Pascal) who meet again after 25 years. Flashbacks reveal their early romance, when they partnered as hired gunmen. “This is a queer Western,” Almodóvar revealed on the “Dua Lipa: At Your Service” podcast. “There are two men, and they love each other, and they behave in that situation in an opposite way. It has a lot of the elements of the Western. It has the gunslinger. It has the ranch. It has the sheriff. But what it has that most Westerns don’t have is the kind of dialogue that I don’t think a Western film has ever captured between two men.” —ATIt’s been almost a decade since “Under the Skin” debuted in the fall of 2013, but the ever-unpredictable Jonathan Glazer has finally returned with another film: A Martin Amis adaptation starring Christian Friedel and Sandra Hüller. We’re told the movie tweaks the source material in order to focus on a Nazi commandant and his wife’s shared dream of building a beautiful home and garden for themselves next to the camp, but either way the film is sure to be every bit as confrontational and dread-inducing as Glazer’s previous work, even if it eschews the usual Holocaust movie tropes in order to probe the inner lives of those who passively observed and/or participated in one of history’s worst atrocities. —DE",

        "content": "Parker Posey didn’t lose sleep over her “Sleepless in Seattle” role being cut from the final film.The “Beau Is Afraid” and “Party Girl” icon revealed that she was cast in the Nora Ephron film, with the writer-director later reaching out to assure Posey that her performance was not why she was cut out of the rom-com starring Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks.“Nora was so supportive,” Posey recalled to Vogue. “She told me I was a ‘gifted comedienne,’ which I’d never been called before.”Ephron wrote Posey a note apologizing for the final edit; Posey was later cast in Ephron’s “Mixed Nuts” and “You’ve Got Mail,” with a role that Ephron created specifically for her.“Being on set with Nora was kinda like a cocktail party without the cocktails — it’s still the best catering I’ve ever had on a film set,” Posey said. “She didn’t have a lot to say, which is why everyone really wanted to please her and try to make her laugh.”Tom Hanks recently praised late filmmaker Ephron, with whom he collaborated on both “Sleepless in Seattle” and “You’ve Got Mail.” Hanks credited Ephron for encouraging his writing career.“She told me I was a writer when I didn’t realize I was a writer,” Hanks said during the “Q with Tom Power” podcast. “When we first met for ‘Sleepless in Seattle,’ I was a big shot. I had everybody telling me I was a big shot. Nora was very, very patient.”Hanks suggested changing the dialogue between his character and onscreen son (played by Ross Malinger) during a fight scene on set.“So here are these two women that are running rehearsals, and I was complaining continuously that they were women and I was a man,” Hanks recalled. “‘Men are not undone by their sons. Oh, boo hoo, my son doesn’t want me to go out. You know what I’d say to the little bastard if I was going out on a date and he tried —’ and I just kept going on, all this kind of stuff. And Nora and Delia would say, ‘Well, what would you say?’ I said, ‘Well, I would say this, la la la.’ And they took that and they put it in the movie.”He added, “Once the movie came out, I said, ‘Hey, you know, that stuff was pretty funny.’ And Nora said, ‘Well, you wrote that. I said, ‘No, I just said it, then you guys put it in the movie.’ And she said, ‘That’s what writing is!’”",

        "content": "Sarah Snook is stuck in a twisted game of hide and seek with the daughter she thought she knew.The “Succession” actress leads Daina Reid’s feature directorial debut “Run Rabbit Run,” which premiered at 2023 Sundance. Snook plays Sarah, a mother and fertility doctor whose own daughter Mia’s behavior drastically becomes more and more unhinged upon her seventh birthday. A surprise pet rabbit present unlocks Mia’s (Lily Latorre) memories of a supposed past life, and sending Sarah down a rabbit hole of horror.Damon Herriman and Greta Scacchi also star.Director Reid has previously helmed episodes of “The Shining Girls” and “The Handmaid’s Tale,” both starring Elisabeth Moss who was once attached to “Run Rabbit Run.” The script is penned by Australian novelist Hannah Kent, with an original idea developed by Carver Films. Anna McLeish and Sarah Shaw of Carver serve as producers, with Snook executive producing along with director Reid. Indie studio XYZ Films financed the film with Screen Australia and will handle international sales, with Netflix having the global rights out of Sundance.Lead actress Snook formerly collaborated with director Reid on the limited series “The Secret River.” IndieWire’s Ryan Lattanzio compared “Run Rabbit Run” to “The Babadook” and “Relic,” among other trauma-ridden horror films.“[‘Run Rabbit Run’] largely tears from the playbook of similar recent horror titles about mothers wracked by grief and trauma who are staring down supernatural events that confront them with their strained relationships with their own mothers and children,” Lattanzio wrote. “Ultimately, ‘Run Rabbit Run’ is a pile-up of banal horror tropes…The saving grace that makes ‘Rabbit’ maybe worth seeing is an unkempt Sarah Snook, who goes into full, well, ‘Babadook’ and ‘Black Swan’ and even ‘Repulsion’ territory in the movie’s final throwdown. But that these are reference points at all suggests the movie’s mundanity and missing original pieces.”While “Run Rabbit Run” is the first film to debut after Snook’s turn in “Succession,” the actress is set to also star in upcoming film “The Beanie Bubble” alongside Elizabeth Banks, Zach Galifianakis, Geraldine Viswanathan, and Carl Clemons-Hopkins about the brand that took over plush collectibles. “Run Rabbit Run” debuts June 28 on Netflix.

        "title": "Disney Will Start Removing Content from Its Streaming Platforms",
        "content": "Disney may not be the happiest streamer in the world any longer.During the May 2023 earnings call on Wednesday, CEO Bob Iger said, “We realized that we made a lot of content that is not necessarily driving sub growth, and we’re getting much more surgical about what it is we make. So as we look to reduce content spend, we’re looking to reduce it in a way that should not have any impact at all on subs.”Iger said when Disney+ launched three and a half years ago, the goal was still growing global subscribers and flooding the “digital shelves.” As with the rest of the industry, that has changed to focus on revenue, and it’s led to cost-cutting and finding content that will actually grow subscribers. That includes big tentpole projects, specifically ones that first played in theaters.One of the challenges Iger noticed was with marketing, and he said that under the old model, they were spreading themselves way too thin and not “allocating enough money to even market them when they came on the service,” and that includes some of the studio’s upcoming biggest theatrical releases like “The Little Mermaid,” “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” and “Elemental.”“When you make a lot of content, everything needs to be marketed. You’re spending a lot of money on marketing that are not going to have an impact on the bottom line except negatively due to the marketing costs,” he said. “We believe we actually have an opportunity to lean into those more, put the right marketing dollars against it, allocate more, or basically away from, programming that was not driving any subs at all. This is part of the maturation process as we grow into a business that we had never been in. We’re learning a lot more about it, specifically we’re learning a lot more about how our content behaves on the service and what it is consumers want.”CFO Christine McCarthy cited Iger’s vision for “cost-cutting initiatives” including removing content from Disney+ as the streaming platform looks to add Hulu content to Disney+ as part of a “one-app experience.”“As Bob mentioned, we are making excellent progress on our cost-cutting initiatives and are on track to meet or exceed the efficiency targets we outlined last quarter,” McCarthy said. “During Q2, we took a restructuring charge of approximately $150 million primarily related to severance. While we are continuing to refine our estimates. We currently expect to record additional separate charges of approximately $180 million over the remainder of this fiscal year. With the bulk of that additional charge expected in the third quarter. We are in the process of reviewing the content on our DTC services to align with the strategic changes in our approach to content curation that you’ve heard Bob discussed.” McCarthy continued, “As a result, we will be removing certain content from our streaming platforms and currently expect to take an impairment charge of approximately $1.5 to $1.8 billion the charge which will not be recorded in our segment results will primarily be recognized in the third quarter as we complete our review and remove the content. Going forward, we intend to produce lower volumes of content in alignment with this strategic shift.”Disney is in the process of laying off 7,000 staffers and is on track to meet or exceed cost savings of $5.5 billion. Disney+ lost 4 million subscribers in the quarter that ended March 31.Disney’s direct-to-consumer business lost $659 million in fiscal Q2, with the company crediting Disney+ and ESPN+ for the improvement over last year’s $1 billion loss. Disney+ and ESPN+ recently raised subscription prices. Disney+ is expected to reach profitability in 2024.“We’re pleased with our accomplishments this quarter, including the improved financial performance of our streaming business, which reflect the strategic changes we’ve been making throughout the company to realign Disney for sustained growth and success,” CEO Iger said. “From movies to television, to sports, news, and our theme parks, we continue to deliver for consumers, while establishing a more efficient, coordinated, and streamlined approach to our operations.”Similarly, Warner Bros. Discovery removed content and canceled upcoming productions reportedly for tax write-off purposes under the leadership of CEO David Zaslav. More than 81 titles were removed from HBO’s streamer Max in late 2022.Reporting by Brian Welk and Tony Maglio.",

        "title": "Dolph Lundgren Was Told He Had ‘Two or Three Years’ Left to Live Before Filming ‘Aquaman 2’ Amid Cancer Battle",
        "content": "Dolph Lundgren is opening up about his ongoing cancer battle.The “Rocky” actor revealed he was told he only had “two or three years” left to live after his kidney cancer spread in fall 2021. Lundgren was in London at the time to begin production on “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” and “The Expendables 4.”“We realized it was a lot worse than we thought,” Lundgren said during the latest “In Depth with Graham Bensinger” interview (below). “[The doctor] kind of started talking about all these different tumors, like, in the lung and the stomach and the spine, outside the kidneys. He started saying these things like, ‘You should probably take a break and spend more time with your family,’ and so forth.”Lundgren continued, “I asked him, ‘How long do you think I’ve got left?’ I think he said two or three years, but I could tell in his voice that he probably thought it was less.”The actor’s cancer was first discovered in 2015 when a tumor was removed.“Then I did scans every six months, then you do it every year and it was fine, you know, for five years,” Lundgren said. “In 2020, I was back in Sweden and had some kind of acid reflux or… I didn’t know what it was. So I did an MRI and they found there were a few more tumors around the area.”Six more tumors were discovered by doctors, leading to Lundgren beginning systemic therapy and treatment that mirrored how lung cancer is handled.“If I had gone on the other treatment, I’d have had about three to four months left,” Lundgren said, citing that the lung cancer treatment has been shrinking his tumors by around 30 percent within a three-month period.“2022 was basically watching these medications do their thing,” Lundgren summed up. “Finally things had shrunk to about 90 percent. Now I’m in the process of taking out the remaining scar tissue in those tumors…The prognosis is that, hopefully, when they take these out, there’s no cancer activity and the medication that I’m taking is going to suppress everything else.”",

        "title": "Trace Lysette (Finally) Takes Center Stage in ‘Monica’",
        "content": "The poignant family drama “Monica” is full of artful mirror shots, serving striking visual reminders of the many angles that shape a life. There’s also something poetic about the sidelong coverage when you consider the film‘s luminous star has spent her career as a supporting act — when she’s clearly meant to be a leading lady. Whether she’s seen in a sleek compact, a glancing rearview, or a profile in patina, there’s no such thing as too much Trace Lysette. Delivering both gravitas and levity as the central character in “Monica,” she’s finally given the chance to shine.Most audiences will recognize Lysette from her breakthrough role as Shea in the groundbreaking series “Transparent,” or opposite Jennifer Lopez in “Hustlers,” where her casting was a major boon for trans representation in a studio movie. Even with such high profile gigs, it’s been a long road for Lysette and for “Monica,” for which she first auditioned in early 2017. The pandemic, funding scarcity, and casting issues (Anna Paquin was originally attached in a supporting role) delayed production until the summer of 2021. Through it all, Lysette remained steadfast in her commitment to the project.Told with minimal exposition, “Monica” revolves around a trans woman who returns home after many years to be with her estranged mother Eugenia, who is suffering from dementia. Played by the incomparable Patricia Clarkson, Eugenia is caustic and childlike, both a powerful loose cannon and a frail old woman. Though their relationship is clear to the audience, Eugenia thinks Monica is just another person to help with her care. As Monica attempts to reconnect with her mother, the two women engage in a delicate dance of acceptance and forgiveness, with neither ever fully pinning down where the other stands.“I knew it was really rare to center a trans woman in a title character, and I knew that this story wasn’t an atypical trans story in that a lot of us have rifts with our blood family. And that it being told through her eyes and not other people’s was really rare,” Lysette said during a recent interview with IndieWire. “So even though the dialogue was sparse, I just knew that if I got the chance to do it, I could make it work.”Though the dialogue was minimal, Lysette saw potential in the nascent project. The director is César-nominated Italian filmmaker Andrea Pallaoro, whose first two feature films premiered at the Venice Film Festival and centered women leads. Pallaoro penned the “Monica” script with his longtime collaborator Orlando Tirado, both cisgender men.With this in mind, Lysette did something she doesn’t usually recommend: She gave notes for free.“Andrea wrote a great script, but it was written by a cis man,” she said. “Before I had the job, Andrea and I were having a discussion about it, and they wanted to know what I thought. I don’t recommend this, but I did give them a round of free notes. They asked and I gave it freely, but I also wanted them to know how invested I was in telling this story.”Lysette illustrates a unique predicament that often faces performers from marginalized identities; whether or not to draw on their own experience to improve someone else’s project. In this case, she was grateful to be met by collaborators who not only listened to her, but recognized and compensated her for her expertise by being named an executive producer.“If someone says, ‘Let me know your thoughts,’ and then you discuss a larger conversation around a script, I think it can be tricky, especially for marginalized groups. Because at the end of the day, we’ve got to put food on the table. And if we’re lending our life experience, you hope that there’s some sort of a check attached to it. But I don’t think I was expecting that at that point,” she said. “I was in a place of just generosity and just wanting this story to be right, and wanting to show them how passionate I was. … And in the end, they brought me on as a executive producer, which was good.”There were two key moments where Lysette’s advocacy really stood out: When she fought to cut an instance of Monica being deadnamed, and when she lobbied to include a scene of Monica performing sex work.“At one point there was a line where it gets said to her and we were like, ‘Maybe we’re past that.’ And it became a large discussion. And thankfully, they were collaborative and wanted to do what the trans voices on set thought was the right thing to do. So we ended up not saying that line,” she said. “I think it was much more elegant and beautiful that way. … I love that it’s not heavy-handed.”To show how Monica made a living, Lysette felt strongly about representing the many trans women who survive on sex work. Not only for authenticity, but to highlight the limited employment options available to trans women. In the first act of the film, we see Monica performing on-camera sex work through her laptop in her hotel room. For Lysette, this one was personal.“I come from the hustle. I come from survival sex work, and pre-internet survival sex work, so old school sex work in the West Village. I was like, ‘We have to see a glimpse of something because the girls are out here doing what they have to do to survive with what society has given them, which isn’t much,'” Lysette said. “I fought for that to get put back in. It wasn’t in the final cut of the film. … There was actually another trick at the top of the film where I’m jacking off the guy who I give the massage to, and that got taken out as well. And I thought, ‘Well, we need one or the other. We need to know what she does to survive.'”All that behind-the-scenes work doesn’t detract one bit from Lysette’s performance, which is gracefully dialed in and expansively nuanced. Monica stays remarkably collected throughout the trying circumstances, rarely expressing the full range of her emotions with conventional outbursts or monologues.But she is always onscreen, even if in oblique profiles or at odd angles, and Lysette is able to translate depths of experience with very little speech to fall back on.“A lot of people don’t always want to confront the tough stuff. And I think with the limited time they had left, that’s why you don’t see some big blowout scene with her mom on her deathbed. … I thought it was interesting and beautiful and it’s definitely a choice,” she said. “So you cannot phone it in, because it reads. There were no easy scenes. And I knew that going in, I knew how much would be going through Monica’s mind at any given time and through her heart. There was a lot of internal work that had to go on in every single scene. There were no light days.”IFC Films will release “Monica” in limited theaters on May 12, 2023.",

        "title": "Disney+ Lost Another 4 Million Subscribers in March Quarter",
        "content": "Disney+ is regressing — in subscribers, at least.The Disney streaming service lost 4 million overall subscribers in the company’s fiscal second quarter after losing 2.4 million subs in Q1. All told, the company now has 231.3 million streaming total streaming subscriptions, counting Disney+, Disney+ Hotstar (which led the losses), Hulu, and ESPN+.Netflix ended the same quarter with 232.5 million global paid subscribers, which means as of March 31, 2023, Netflix is again the undisputed streaming king in terms of subscriptions. (Though Amazon might like a word.) Disney’s total portfolio had previously surpassed Netflix’s subscriber count, though the ARPUs (average revenue per user) are wildly in Netflix’s favor.Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar now combine for 157.8 million subscribers. Here’s the new breakdown:\n\nDisney+ (core): 104.9 million, up 1 percent from 104.3 million at the end of Q1\nDisney+ Hotstar: 52.9 million, down 8 percent from 57.5 million at the end of Q1\nHulu: 48.2 million, up a hair from 48 million at the end of Q1\nESPN+: 25.3 million, up 2 percent from 24.9 million at the end of Q1While most subscriber losses came from Disney+ Hotstar — the name of the (very) low-revenue-generating Disney+ in India and other Southeast Asia countries — core Disney+ did lose 300,000 subscribers in the U.S. and Canada. Excluding Disney+ Hotstar, the service grew 2 percent internationally. Hotstar has been hurting since Disney lost cricket rights.Disney’s direct-to-consumer business lost $659 million in fiscal Q2, which is an improvement on the $1 billion it lost last quarter. The company credited Disney+ and ESPN+ for the improvement; the two services recently raised subscription prices. Hulu, which like Netflix has been profitable for years, struggled along with the advertising market.Disney executives have previously stated they expect Disney+ is expected to reach profitability next year. There was no such mention of the benchmark in the fiscal Q2 earnings announcement.Here’s all CEO Bob Iger had to say: “We’re pleased with our accomplishments this quarter, including the improved financial performance of our streaming business, which reflect the strategic changes we’ve been making throughout the company to realign Disney for sustained growth and success. From movies to television, to sports, news, and our theme parks, we continue to deliver for consumers, while establishing a more efficient, coordinated, and streamlined approach to our operations.”Surely there will be more when Iger and Disney’s senior executive team host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss the second quarter in greater detail. We’ll hopefully get an update on Disney+ target profitability then.Wall Street forecast Disney’s earnings would come in at 93 cents per share on revenue of $21.79 billion. The consensus was right on the money, literally, on earnings per share; Disney posted $21.815 billion in revenue, which was slightly better than estimates. Revenue was 13 percent better than the comparable quarter last year, but earnings decreased 14 percent.The Parks, Experiences, and Products segment was the star of the quarter, with Shanghai Disney Resort, Disneyland Paris, and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort rising the tide overseas; Disney’s cruise line performed admirably stateside. Merchandise from the Star Wars, Spider-Man, Frozen, and The Avengers brands decreased.Disney’s media and entertainment businesses combined for a 42 percent loss in operating income; you can blame linear television for nearly all of that.The studio’s big second-quarter theatrical release was “Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania,” which proved to be a disappointment at the box office. Thankfully there was plenty of carryover success from “Avatar: The Way of Water.” There wasn’t a whole lot to speak about in terms of series: “The Mandalorian” Season 3 came out March 1 on Disney+.Theatrically, the current quarter should stand on its own two feet with “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” “The Little Mermaid,” “Elemental,” and “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.” That last one comes out on June 30, however, which is the final day of Disney’s fiscal third quarter. Any Indy profits from the big-screen performance will have to wait for the company’s final quarter (again, on a reporting basis — Disney does not follow the calendar year).",

        "content": "The cast and crew of “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” wanted to take on more impossible stunts.Director Christopher McQuarrie, who previously helmed 2015’s “Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation: and 2018’s “Mission: Impossible – Fallout,” recalled discussing the dream stunts with lead star Tom Cruise during a new interview with Entertainment Weekly.“At the start of this movie, I said to Tom, ‘What do you want to do?'” McQuarrie shared. “He said, ‘I want to drive a motorcycle off of a cliff. What do you want to do?’ And I said, ‘I want to wreck a train.’ We’re enormous fans of Buster Keaton, John Frankenheimer, David Lean, all of these filmmakers who at one time or another had a fabulous train wreck. I thought, ‘I’ve earned that, I want to wreck one too.'”The production used a 70-ton train in the United Kingdom, with the train crashed into the Darlton Quarry for the film.“I think the energy that went into developing it, designing that, building it, and then making a sequence that justified its existence was probably the biggest challenge of my entire life,” McQuarrie said.The first 20 minutes of the Paramount Pictures film debuted during 2023 CinemaCon, with Paramount Global chief Bob Bakish calling the action movie an “insane” achievement. “It’s like a complete thrill ride. And Tom, he’s very good,” Bakish said.“The ‘MI’ series really does represent the pinnacle of filmmaking excellence,” Paramount president Brian Robbins similarly said earlier this year. “And we have no doubt that this new picture will set the bar even higher.”Robbins continued, “After five release dates and a whole bunch of rumors where this movie would end up, we are finally ready to bring this phenomenal movie to where it always belonged, and that is your theaters.”Cruise allegedly pushed Paramount via legal action to guarantee a longer theatrical window prior to the film being available to stream on Paramount+. “M:I 7” production was repeatedly halted by the pandemic with the budget reportedly increasing to upwards of $290 million. The film is set to open in theaters July 12, with “Dead Reckoning Part Two” out in 2024.",

        "title": "What Do Those Academy Inclusion Standards for Best Picture Really Mean?",
        "content": "As unfortunate as it is that the reason the Academy’s inclusion standards are back in the news (because of an answer Oscar winner Richard Dreyfuss recently gave in an interview that ultimately led into his defense of blackface), it is worth it to take a closer look at them before they officially go into effect this coming film awards season.While one can find a more detailed description of them on the Academy website, the organization has listed Standards A through D with the requirement that a film meet at least two in order to qualify for Best Picture (the only category the standards are applied to). Standard A focuses on on-screen representation, themes, and narratives, meaning the film could be centered on an underrepresented group (women included), or have some level of meaningful diversity among its acting ensemble (even a significant supporting role for an actor of color counts).Standard B focuses on creative leadership and project team, meaning a film with a diverse crew or several crew members from underrepresented backgrounds in key roles like a department head or Script Supervisor would qualify.Standard C focuses on industry access and opportunities, so if the production company or distributor has a DEI program like Universal Directors Initiative, that counts.Standard D focuses on audience development, so a studio and/or film company has multiple in-house senior executives from among the following underrepresented groups.The technical aspect of the process would be that, as a film prepares to submit for Best Picture consideration, the production company and/or studio would separately need to fill out an application on the Academy’s RAISE platform (RAISE being an acronym standing for Representation and Inclusion Standards Entry). The submission form will have an ID that can be added to the standard Oscar submission form, so the data from the two applications can be merged on the backend.It is important to again note that only two of the standards need to be met in order to qualify for Best Picture, so if a film has distribution from a major corporation like Warner Bros. Discovery, which has several DEI initiatives and a studio co-run by Pamela Abdy, it likely only needs its distributor to fill out the form in order to qualify via Standards C and D. That said, the cost of the pandemic has partially been paid by the loss of many diversity and inclusion initiatives part of cost-cutting measures, so Standard C has become harder to qualify for.If a film’s route toward qualifying for Best Picture is through Standards A and B, its production company has resources like Crewvie or Free the Work to organize a project’s demographic information. A hypothetical concern as the standards are implemented is that it is likely more difficult to collect demographic information after the fact, than as the production is hiring, so it’s likely that a service like Crewvie becomes a part of the onboarding process for more and more productions. Those services also offer a tool that organizes all the information a film would need to qualify for the inclusion standards into one document.If subject matter is how a film qualifies for Standard A, the RAISE form also has an option to for the filmmaker to explain why, which is especially helpful to international filmmakers that may need to shed light on something like a country’s caste system, which may not be common knowledge to Americans.While there is an expectation from Academy members that the organization help lead the conversation around equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the film industry, Jeanell English, the Academy’s Executive Vice President of Impact and Inclusion, recently said to The Hollywood Reporter, “It’s important to note we’re not an analytics institution. We rely heavily on data from great places, whether it’s USC or UCLA, to help demonstrate the trends.”Last August, Academy CEO Bill Kramer also said of the industry standards, “We want this to be collaborative. And again, seeing that the best Picture nominees of this past year all qualify gave us great hope that our conversations and partnership with studios and distributors and filmmakers is working, and is not creating a challenge.”Though change is often met with resistance, the overall takeaway in the two years that filmmakers have shared inclusion data with their Oscar submissions has been that many films qualify for the inclusion standards without even knowing it, so it is unlikely that such standards are the attack on creativity critics, like Dreyfuss, claim they are.",

        "title": "How to Make a Modern Period Piece for $5 Million: Behind the Scenes of ‘BlackBerry’",
        "content": "In 2010, David Fincher set the template for modern tech biopic with “The Social Network,” delivering a rapid-fire seriocomic portrait of young entrepreneurship at the dawn of the 21st century. It cost $40 million. Last year, filmmaker Matt Johnson made “BlackBerry,” a biopic about the rise and fall of the eccentric characters behind the outdated mobile phone. It cost $5 million.“The amount of money that gets spent on making a movie is completely mind-boggling to me,” Johnson told IndieWire over Zoom. “We were pretty clear from the beginning we would make something on the scale we prefer.”That ethos was established 10 years ago, when the Canadian director made the buzzy found footage movie “The Dirties,” in which Johnson starred as an aspiring filmmaker who morphs into a high school shooter. The $10,000 movie manages a tricky balance between satirizing its character’s cinematic aspirations and the looming alienation that drives him to a horrific extreme. The complex and emotional provocation won Slamdance and gained support from Kevin Smith, who helped distribute the movie. “Our lives changed very much,” he said. “Going from a broke student filmmaker to having a career was extremely difficult to manage.”While Johnson signed with an agency and entertained studio offers, he continued to churn out innovative lo-fi work from his perch in Toronto, including 2016’s “Operation Avalanche,” a playful snippet of historical fiction in which Johnson and Owen Williams play young CIA agents tasked with faking the moon landing in 1969. He also created the web series and eventual Canadian TV show “Nirvanna the Band the Show,” which ran from 2017-2019 and was made with the same collaborators.“For the most part, studio heads really do want to meet with young, interesting voices,” Johnson said. “It’s generally a meritocracy. But my experience was that nothing really spoke to me, and I always came back to what interested me because of that.”His longtime writing and producer partner Matthew Miller, who joined him on Zoom, chimed in. “None of this ever felt like work,” he said.“BlackBerry” marks the first time John and Miller worked on material together that they didn’t originate, as they adapted the script from the book “Losing the Signal: The Untold Story Behind the Extraordinary Rise and Spectacular Fall of BlackBerry,” after producers who had acquired rights to the book approached them about directing it. “They could’ve given the material and book to more conventional filmmakers and would’ve gotten something more conventional,” Miller said said.Instead, Johnson and Miller turned the saga into a wry, almost minimalist workplace comedy. At its center is the evolving dynamic between geeky innovator Mike Lazaridis (Jay Baruchel) and his fun-loving partner-in-crime Douglas Fregin (Johnson), as their shrewd idea for a smartphone capable of sending and receiving emails attracts the attention of combustible executive Jim Balsillie (Glenn Howerton, bald and gruffer than his “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” persona).After Balsillie talks his way into becoming co-CEO of the scrappy startup, “BlackBerry” careens through a series of cringe-worthy chapters in the company’s history as loyalties are tested and the original duo’s easygoing workplace environment gets forced into the cutthroat demands of a corporate ecosystem. Through a series of shouting matches, awkward pitch sessions, and slapstick twists (including a prototype that goes missing moments before a big presentation), “BlackBerry” magnifies the underlying tension between personalities when innovation and capitalism collide.Johnson said that while he hasn’t done his time in Silicon Valley, he was still able to draw from personal experiences. “We tried to make it very close metaphorically to what filmmaking is like,” he said. “How success can change the culture of a production company — we just grafted that onto corporate culture.”They were also wary of mocking Lazaridis, a geeky figure played Baruchel with a level of empathy he hasn’t shown onscreen before, as the character attempts to do the right thing with the technology even as Balsillie attempts to push the company into legally dicey and otherwise tumultuous territory.In other words, nothing like the goofballs on “Silicon Valley,” a show he knew would come up as a comparison early on. “Those guys are very clearly trying to be funny and very proud of themselves for it,” he said. “That’s revolting to me, and it wasn’t influential in terms of how we did this.”Instead, he turned to more serious precedents, looking at “All the President’s Men” as well as D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus’ 1993 Bill Clinton campaign documentary “The War Room” to determine the approach. “They had a lot of scenes with men in rooms trying to change the world,” Johnson said. “We didn’t want to Hollywoodize it and make these guys seem like Elon Musk. They had to be like LAN party nerds who — by happenstance — wind up changing the world and not even realizing they did it.”While it lacks the polished surfaces of “The Social Network,” Johnson and Miller did enough research ahead of the writing and production process to make a much bigger movie. They secretly interviewed ex-staffers and combed through diaries from several stages of the company’s history, from its early successes to the downward slope of its existence in the aftermath of the iPhone release. Their production designer put together a bible for the show out of 2,500 photos provided by former BlackBerry employees.That provided the key to their low-budget approach. “BlackBerry” takes place in a handful of messy office spaces and bland conference rooms. There are no massive crowd scenes or travel montages. “We were working with very little money and that meant we needed to shoot it a certain way,” Johnson said. Still, the budget for the movie came together in piecemeal, which created some new challenges. Telefilm Canada provided the bulk of the financing (with less than 10 percent provided by the American-based XYZ Films).The Canadian financing made it difficult to cast any American actors, including Howerton, despite his fame. “It wasn’t until very close to production we were finally able to present it to him,” Johnson said. The result is the actor’s first great performance outside of “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” which returns with its 16th season in June. “The fact that we have Glenn shaving his head and sticking with it creates a sense that this movie is going somewhere,” Johnson said. “It buys us so much good will. It’s a comedy performance but the characters don’t think he’s funny. He’s deadly serious and quite humorous.”Johnson’s homegrown approach had to evolve to meet the needs of actors who weren’t part of the original group involved in all of his previous endeavors. “Normally, I’m just working with my friends and everything is improvised,” he said. “You very much direct and write on the fly. This had to be done differently because of strangers who didn’t necessarily trust me. It wasn’t until the second week of shooting that we could start taking risks.”Eventually, Johnson was able to settle back into his usual documentary-like approach, which finds him shooting in wide shots and encouraging his actors to keep performing without any real sense of when the cameras are rolling. “I’m expecting people to always be on,” he said.Producers were able to pre-sell U.S. rights to IFC off material screens for buyers at AFM last fall, which helped cover finishing costs ahead of the movie’s premiere at Berlin in February. After the movie’s premiere, Paramount acquired international rights. “It’s been so much fun to have the support of these distributors, but it’s also very odd,” Johnson said. “I’ve been able to do what I want, I always have final cut, and I can literally make anything I want to make.”Now, the 37-year-old director is keen on maintaining that setup rather than entertaining that kind of offers thrust his way a decade ago. “We started making stuff in our twenties in different life positions and all our friends were paying cheap rent,” he said. “As you get older and want to work with the same people, it’s harder. But we hope to keep being able to graduate up that way.”IFC Films opens “BlackBerry” in limited theaters on Friday, May 12.",

        "content": "Natalie Portman is reflecting on the rise and fall of the Time’s Up movement.The ticking clock behind the movement, of which Portman was a founding member in 2018, fully “dissipated” and culminated in the CEO exiting in 2021. The Time’s Up movement was based on combating sexual harassment in the workplace. Portman opened up about the “mistakes” made leading the non-profit in a Hollywood Reporter cover story.“It was really, really heartbreaking that Time’s Up dissipated the way it did. I think a lot of people made mistakes, but mistakes are deadly for activism,” Portman said. “You have to be so perfect in order to demand the change that you want to see, and I don’t know, maybe acknowledging all our imperfection as humans and saying that people can do something wrong and also be good at something else, having a little bit more shades of gray might actually let us get to more progress.”The Oscar winner continued, “There was something so powerful about just gathering women with similar experiences and sharing. And so many amazing things have spun off it that I think those relationships have persisted and have turned into incredible other projects, but it still is painful that Time’s Up doesn’t exist anymore as it was. For an entire movement to not be allowed to exist because of individual mistakes or even collective mistakes, I think that we have to be able to make mistakes and learn from them and allow that.”Portman added, “It’s a great silencing mechanism to hold people up to perfection standards because then everyone’s like, ‘Well, I shouldn’t say anything because I’m not perfect.'”The actress, who is next starring in Todd Haynes’ Cannes premiere “May/December,” addressed the festival’s fraught history with women amid the MeToo movement.“I think that it’s something that they’re responding to now, which I’m happy that they’ve been pressured to do so,” Portman said. “I obviously wish it were a lot farther along…It can always be better. We will keep pushing for it to be better.”",

        "content": "Shia LaBeouf is washing away his sins in the biopic of real-life monk Padre Pio.The eponymous film, directed by Abel Ferrara, will be distributed by Gravitas Ventures. “Padre Pio” stars LaBeouf as the Italian monk who rose to fame in Catholicism during the two world wars. Padre Pio, born Francesco Forgione, exhibited stigmata, or Christ-like crucifixion wounds. Padre Pio died in 1968 at the age of 81; he was later beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1999 and canonized in 2002.The film is co-written by Ferrara and Maurizio Braucci. “He’s an iconic figure,” Ferrara told Variety of Padre Pio’s legacy. “He’s on the back of every truck. He’s the saint of every drug dealer in Naples. Pio is like the alternative Jesus, in a way.”After connecting with LaBeouf about the role, Ferrara said the “Transformers” alum was “driving to a monastery in California” moments later to fully immerse himself in the experience. LaBeouf donned monk-like robes and slept in Padre Pio’s former bed at a southern Italian monastery during production. Ferrara noted the film is supported by the Padre Pio brotherhood, with LaBeouf acting opposite real monks.“He’s bringing his own life to it,” Ferrara said of LaBeouf’s performance. “You are seeing a person going through a very similar experience. It’s not just about wearing robes and performing actions. He connected very deeply with Pio’s journey in the film. When the actor is living a parallel-type journey, that’s when you get such a powerful performance.”The film debuted at the 2022 Venice Film Festival and marked LaBeouf’s return to the screen in two years. Gravitas Ventures senior director of theatrical distribution Cameron Moore called LaBeouf’s performance “show-stopping” in the career-changing “religious biopic.”LaBeouf also stars in Francis Ford Coppola’s upcoming “Megalopolis.”“Padre Pio” will be released June 2.

        "content": "Will Poulter is shining a light on the warped reflection of Hollywood.The “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” star called out the emphasis on looks in the film industry, citing the “backhanded compliment” behind a “glow-up” transformation across his career during a wide-spanning interview with GQ.“It’s funny — when things trend like that on the Internet, all context is lost and a big one is talking about overnight transformations. The one that went viral in relation to me was a picture of me in ‘We’re The Millers’ next to a picture of me in ‘Guardians.’ There’s literally 10 years between those two pictures but people don’t even realize it,” Poulter said. “Someone in the pub two days ago said, ‘Oh, you’ve had a glow up. Congrats.’ It’s a little bit hard to not accept that as, ‘You were ugly for the best part of your life, and now things are looking up a bit!'”The “Midsommar” alum added, “I don’t know if that’s just me being cynical, but it’s hard to not take it as a backhanded compliment. People say it like it’s positive, but it could also contribute to a complex.”Poulter continued, “It was weird when people started to debate my physical appearance online as to whether it was deemed attractive or unattractive. I am very comfortable and secure in the knowledge that I’m not conventionally attractive as I’ve always had remarks about looking unusual — whether it’s my eyebrows or whatever else, people have made a thing of that. I think it just speaks to a wider issue, of: Why are we discussing or spending so much time discussing people’s physical appearance? Especially in the case of women. But whether you’re male or female, why is that the focus so much? Unfortunately, social media has created this problematic idea that everyone’s opinion on everything matters equally.”Following his viral turn in Ari Aster’s horror film “Midsommar” and subsequent dating rumors surrounding his co-stars, Poulter noted that his level of fame skyrocketed to an “uncomfortable” height.“For the last few years, virtually every day, someone takes a photo without asking, which is uncomfortable,” he said. “To a large degree, male privilege has protected me from that kind of objectification and the idea that up until now really I’ve been able to go about my job and not have my physical appearance be something of a subject matter — that privilege hasn’t been afforded to my female counterparts in the industry.”Poulter turned his attention toward staying in shape, namely hitting the gym harder to play Adam Warlock in James Gunn’s final Marvel film.“When I’m in a mentally unhealthy state, how do I manage my relationship with those things? Physical exercise has been the thing that has really sustained me more than anything else,” Poulter said. “All I know is I worked as hard as I could, safely and naturally, to conceivably pass as a superhero. If that isn’t enough for people, fair enough, but I’m not prepared to compromise on the way that I went about it. I can’t be an advocate for mental health and simultaneously be promoting anything other than responsible and natural bodybuilding. I wouldn’t want anyone to feel like I’m suggesting there is a body type that is better than anybody else’s body type.”",

        "content": "Tom Cruise gave himself an impossible task: Smoothing things over with longtime pal Emilio Estevez.According to Estevez in an Uproxx interview, Cruise regretted killing off his character in 1996 film “Mission: Impossible,” which kicked off an almost three-decade-long franchise. Cruise plays rogue CIA agent Ethan Hunt, with the original Brian de Palma film infamously having a bloody cold open killing off most of the A-lister cast.“The way Tom had explained it, he said, ‘Look, I’d love for you to come and join the cast. The whole opening number where everybody gets wiped out, it’s going to be a lot of well-known people and all of them are going to go uncredited and it’s really going to set up the level of peril for Ethan,'” Estevez recalled. “And I said, ‘I’m in. You don’t have to ask me twice, I’m in.’ And then afterwards, obviously, the movie’s a giant hit.”“Mission: Impossible” has spurred seven sequels, with the final two installments, “Dead Reckoning” parts one and two, debuting in 2023 and 2024. The next films are helmed by Christopher McQuarrie, who directed “Fallout” and “Rogue Nation,” with Cruise serving as a producer. Production for “Dead Reckoning Part One” was repeatedly halted by the COVID-19 pandemic but eventually wrapped in September 2021.“[They’re] still making them!” Estevez said. “Tom was like, we were doing a run the year after that and he says, ‘Man, we made such a mistake killing you off.'”Estevez added that “Mission: Impossible 2” director John Woo even discussed having Estevez return in a different role.“He and John Woo were trying to figure out a way to bring me back for Part Two, but it just didn’t make sense,” he said. “I thought you could have because with all the masks, right?”Estevez appears in former “St. Elmo’s Fire” co-star Andrew McCarthy’s upcoming documentary on the ’80s Brat Pack, to which he compared Cruise and McCarthy, saying he would work with them in any capacity “without question.”“It was like Tom: The people who never ask, you just say yes,” Estevez said. “It’s like a Willy Wonka moment. You just say, ‘Yeah, of course. I’ll participate.'”",

        "title": "Paul Schrader on the ‘Explicit’ Script He Gave to Elisabeth Moss: ‘I’m an Old Male. How Am I Going to Direct This?’",
        "content": "Paul Schrader will not keep mum.On Monday night, the filmmaker spoke at Santa Monica’s Aero Theatre between screenings of “First Reformed” (2017) and “The Card Counter” (2021). He’s been making the promo rounds of late, whether sharing his new digs on Facebook or being interviewed by New York Magazine or, most recently, The New Yorker.His distributors often ask him to refrain from Facebook posting ahead of the release of his new film — in this case “Master Gardener” (Magnolia, May 19), starring the romantic triangle of Joel Edgerton, Sigourney Weaver, and Quintessa Swindell, which played well at Venice. It’s the concluding film in Schrader’s lonely-man-in-a-room trilogy, including “First Reformed” and “The Card Counter.” And yet the indefatigable Schrader is still posting, weighing in on A.I., among other things, and during the conversation, he also spoke about the tricky movie he’s written and now hopes Elisabeth Moss will star in and direct.Like other WGA creators barred from certain promo duties right now, the unrepentant director admitted that while he was told in an email that he is not allowed to campaign for his movies during the writer’s strike, he does it anyway, because any punishment is “toothless,” he said. “A slap on the wrist.”And unlike many pundits, Schrader sees a scenario where the strike could be over sooner rather than later. What has to happen is for the DGA and SAG/AFTRA, whose contracts expire on June 30, to line up in support of the writers’ demands. “Well, the writers like to strike,” he said. “It’s a bump for them. They were formerly unemployed. Now they’re on strike. Directors hate to strike because their guild is primarily assistant directors. And they all lose their jobs when they go on strike. Writers don’t lose their jobs. Believe me, none of the keyboards in Hollywood have stopped working at night. They’re all working right as we speak right now. And then when the strike is over, there’ll be this surfeit of spec scripts.”“But for the first time, the stars are aligning,” he said, with the DGA and the SAG/AFTRA in talks ahead of the June 30 deadline. “The directors don’t like to strike. It’s the same issue. They’re getting burned by the streamers in the same way. So if the directors line up behind the writers, and then if SAG will line up behind them, the strike will be over — boom, right there. The streamers will bump up, they don’t have a choice. So theoretically the strike could go on seven or eight months, but if the director and actors join in, it’s over.”As for A.I., clearly the producers and writers are far apart in the negotiations on this topic, with each side assuming they should get control of the work that comes from chatbots. “A.I. is not going to be resolved, it is going to be very much part of our future,” he said. “And the truth is that a lot of the television scripts and movies you now see are written kind of by A.I. already. If someone were to ask me, say, ‘Do an episode of ‘CSI,’ I’d watch a dozen CSIs to catch the template — the set of characters, all the dialogue, all the pilot positions, everything you need to take a template, I could knock that off easy enough. But that’s the same thing A.I. is going to do. They’re probably going to make a better episode of ‘CSI’ because it’s faster, cheaper and does not waste its time with any pretension.”What’s next? In July, Schrader plans to start filming “Oh, Canada,” an adaptation of a 2021 Russell Banks novel about a dying documentary filmmaker starring his “American Gigolo” star Richard Gere. “Canada being a metaphor for death,” he said. ‘It’s my ‘Ivan Ilyich.'” A movie he won’t make: “R.N.,” his first screenplay featuring a female protagonist. It’s about a trauma nurse in Puerto Rico. “I wanted to do a film about female sexual irresponsibility, mainly behavior that just causes trouble,” he said. “I thought, ‘This is really good.’ But there was a lot of explicit sex in it, masturbation. I’m an old male. ‘How am I going to direct this?’ This is not my part of town. There are a lot of female directors out there now, not like decades ago, when there were only two or three. I feel out of place here, I feel like I’m in Spike Lee’s house telling him how to redecorate. And so I decided not to do it. And then I subsequently have now offered it to Elisabeth Moss for her to star and direct.”",

        "title": "Jane Fonda and Cast Dish on ‘Book Club 2’: ‘I Have This Problem, Maybe It’s Narcissism’",
        "content": "“Book Club: The Next Chapter” is one of those rare sequels that feels like an earned inevitability rather than a desperate bid. That’s because its quartet of genuinely iconic stars — Jane Fonda, Diane Keaton, Mary Steenburgen, and Candice Bergen — all wanted to make another movie with director Bill Holderman, and the 2018 original film’s $104 million global gross certainly sweetened the deal.So did a two-month-plus, all-expenses-paid trip to Italy.In the Focus Features sequel, the four bookish besties rekindle after a long pandemic slog of dishing on books and slurping wine over Zoom. Here, Vivian (Fonda), Diane (Keaton, and of course, she’s named Diane, and in outfits that could have only come from Keaton’s closet), Sharon (Bergen), and Carol (Steenburgen) are all tangling with crises that apply to any stage of life: love, marriage, and career.But they’re doing so on a glitzy trip to Florence, Rome, and beyond, and with their book club selection, Paul Coehlo’s “The Alchemist,” as their guide. (Indeed, it’s a bit of a dial-down from their last selection, “Fifty Shades of Grey.”)Except, as Fonda, Steenburgen, and Bergen revealed in a lively interview with IndieWire, not all had read the book prior to filming on location in Italy, including at the famed Cinecittà Studios. And they still haven’t.“It’s a parable. It’s not easy. It’s a little tiny skinny book. I read it a couple of weeks ago, in fact, because I knew Mary was reading it, so I thought I had to be prepared,” said Bergen.But Fonda hasn’t read the Portuguese novel about an Andalusian making his way to mythic treasure, which has been co-opted in literary circles as a kind of self-help text for those hoping to realize a far-off dream. Maybe it felt like homework.“She gets an incomplete,” Bergen, who plays an acridly witty judge not quite over her retirement, said of her co-star.“I don’t read novels very much,” Fonda said with a laugh. Whether Keaton has read the book, who knows. She couldn’t participate in the junket, as she’s off filming a movie called “Summer Camp” with Kathy Bates.So why Italy? “It was like a magnet,” said Bergen who, with Steenburgen back at CinemaCon 2018, hatched the idea for the follow-up film, knowing Italy had to be the place.“Book Club: The Next Chapter” is not groundbreaking cinema, but after decades of provocative, Oscar-winning movies from these leading ladies, that probably comes as a relief for the cast, who were presumably looking to relax on set and hang out with their friends. Keaton, in a recent New York Times interview, demurred that the movie is “fine.” It’s fun, corny, escapist entertainment that should please fans of the book and especially the late-in-life set (and gay men) who adore seeing these women together onscreen.“Book Club: The Next Chapter,” for Oscar-winner and post-“Grace and Frankie” Fonda, did offer a kind of “older woman with pizzazz” role she rarely sees anymore. Her Vivian is a grab-life-by-the-collar hotelier who’s largely avoided romantic attachment until this sequel throws a curveball her way.“I get a lot of attempted pizzazz-y old women or all these stereotypes, and they’re always one-dimensional. It’s very hard to find good scripts for older women,” Fonda said.“I think it’s hard for her to ever get a movie about a woman with pizzazz who can come close to who she is in real life, but all of us love playing not just strong women, weak women, every kind of character we can explore,” said Steenburgen, whose chef Carol is dealing with unhappiness in her marriage.“And strong women can also be weak and vice versa!,” Fonda added. “She’s 86!,” Burgen chimed in of Fonda. “She has more stamina, more motivation, more drive than anyone I know.” “More than any teenager!,” Steenburgen said.“But you know the problem? I have this problem which, maybe it’s narcissism. I think it’s my responsibility to fix everything. It’s like, if I don’t end the war, it’s not going to end. If I don’t fix the climate crisis, it’s not going to happen, and it drives me. I guess it’s good, but I have to be reasonable,” said Fonda, long an advocate for feminism and human rights dating back to her Hanoi Jane countercultural days circa the Vietnam War. Amid it all, she’s also in remission from the non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis she revealed in 2022.“You’re saying it’s not narcissism? I worry about that,” Fonda pressed. “I don’t want to be a narcissist.” “You would never!,” Bergen said. “She’s not a narcissist,” Steenburgen added.Younger audiences who stumble into “Book Club: The Next Chapter” might not have the same connection to these stars (who have piles of Emmy and Oscar wins between them) that older generations do. People of a certain age or demographic (myself included) would probably run to anything they make blindly just for the joy of seeing them all up on screen together. So I asked them what unsung past project they’d want someone of, say, the Gen Z set to check out.Fonda mentioned 1981’s “On Golden Pond,” a film she made as a sort of peacemaking ode to her complicated and often distant showbiz father, Henry Fonda, who died the year after it was released and whose Best Actor Oscar Jane accepted. “It’s kind of universal,” she added.We also talked about her 1986 Sidney Lumet film “The Morning After,” starring Fonda (in peak Original Workout fashion) as a boozy actress implicated in a murder. “I play a drunk! I did that movie… well, that’s another story. What was the question?,” she said.Fonda advocated on behalf of Candice Bergen for audiences to check out “Carnal Knowledge,” Mike Nichols’ vicious 1971 chamber drama starring Bergen as a college student tangled in a toxic erotic triad with Art Garfunkel and Jack Nicholson (whose character is the definition of a 2023 Toxic Male).Steenburgen wants audiences to see Bergen’s Steven Soderbergh film “Let Them All Talk.” Bergen plays Roberta, a hanger-on of Meryl Streep’s literary celebrity character, who hilariously in that improvised film said a line we can all relate to: “I hate my job. I loathe my life. I desperately need money.” But Fonda said, “I’m not sure if Gen Z people would like that movie very much.”As for Steenburgen, check out the 1980 comedy that won her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, “Melvin and Howard.”But they’re not living in the past because, hey, “Book Club: The Next Chapter” got them a vacation and a job in one package. “And a lot of good meals,” Fonda added.“Book Club: The Next Chapter” hits theaters everywhere on Friday, May 12.",

        "title": "Cillian Murphy Never Read ‘Dark Knight Rises’ Script Before Filming: ‘I Didn’t Want to Spoil It’",
        "content": "Longtime Christopher Nolan collaborator Cillian Murphy admitted he declined to read the full “Dark Knight Rises” script to keep the surprise trilogy ending under wraps.Murphy, who portrayed mad scientist Jonathan Crane aka Scarecrow in the superhero films, shared during an oral history alongside director Nolan for Entertainment Weekly that he preferred to be kept in the dark when it came to how the franchise concluded.“I remember when you called, you said, ‘You want to read the script?’ and I said, ‘You know what, I don’t actually want to read the script. Just tell me what I’m doing, just tell me what my motivation is, and then I want to see the movie,'” Murphy said to Nolan. “I didn’t want to spoil it. So I just came in for that one day, did that little bit on that amazing set, and then waited to see the movie. And it was worth it.”Similarly, Murphy previously revealed that he avoided studying any science for Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” in which he plays the titular father of the atomic bomb.“The Dark Knight” director Nolan added during the EW interview that his “favorite” scene with Murphy as Scarecrow in the trilogy is “definitely the kangaroo court scene where he’s on top of that massive pile of desks” from “Dark Knight Rises.”“I just think, in a world of anarchy, the last judge you’d want to come in front of would be Jonathan Crane,” Nolan said, teasing that the character “never died, just conveniently would be sort of offscreen somehow. Therefore [I was] able to call you up and say, ‘Come on back and put the sack over your head one last time.'”Murphy had auditioned to play Batman in the films prior to Christian Bale’s casting. Nolan recalled, “Everybody was so excited by watching you perform that when I then said to them, ‘OK, Christian Bale is Batman, but what about Cillian to play Scarecrow?’ there was no dissent. All the previous Batman villains had been played by huge movie stars: Jack Nicholson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jim Carrey, that kind of thing. That was a big leap for them and it really was purely on the basis of that test. So that’s how you got to play Scarecrow.”Now, Murphy is stepping into his first lead role with Nolan for the highly anticipated WWII period piece “Oppenheimer” complete with an all-star ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, and Emily Blunt.“I have always said publicly and privately, to Chris, that if I’m available and you want me to be in a movie, I’m there. I don’t really care about the size of the part,” Murphy recently said. “But deep down, secretly, I was desperate to play a lead for him.”",

Directed by Sara Dosa, Fire of Love tells their story through the Kraffts’ own archive of images, featuring spectacular, up-close footage of volcanic eruptions taken by the couple as they relentlessly defy danger to gain proximity to ineluctable forces of nature. The result is at once an intimate portrait of an ordinary marriage and a celebration of scientific determination at its most extraordinary.National Geographic Documentary Films presents A Sandbox Films Production / An Intuitive Pictures & Cottage M Production (Disney+)DOCUMENTARY“Aftershock”Aftershock holds a mirror up to the country’s maternal-mortality crisis, presenting a sobering look at the deadly consequences of a medical system that routinely disregards Black women’s health. The documentary follows two families reeling from preventable deaths, tracing their ongoing journeys through grief and toward activism.Onyx Collective and ABC News Studios present a Malka Films and Madstone Company Inc Production In Association with Good Gravy Films and JustFilms | Ford Foundation Impact Partners.“Batata”        Shot over the span of a decade, starting in 2009, Batata follows a Syrian family on a Lebanese farm as they seek to establish an existence as migrant workers harvesting potatoes. As the Syrian Civil War breaks out in 2011, filmmaker Noura Kevorkian stays with the family through the growing strife and conflict. Accounts of war typically drop viewers in after everything is lost, but here is the rare artifact that captures, with power and precision, the exact lives left behind.Saaren Films Inc., Six Island Productions Inc., Musa Dagh Productions (Streaming platforms)“Independent Lens: Missing in Brooks County”             Set in Falfurrias, Texas, the site of a border checkpoint, Missing in Brooks County pivots around two families who arrive in the small town in search of missing loved ones. Their stories are layered within a spectrum of perspectives that exist within the county—from an activist detective and a team of forensic anthropologists working to help locate the remains of missing migrants to a paramilitary figure dead set on enforcing “closed borders.” The end result is a work that deeply internalizes the complexity of the subject without ever losing sight of the prevailing tragedy.ITVS, Fork Films, Engel Entertainment (PBS)“Independent Lens: Writing with Fire”    The fearless journalists of India’s only all-female newspaper redefine traditional notions of power in Writing with Fire, a gripping film from Independent Lens about the intrepid team behind the success of the news outlet Khabar Lahariya. Their passion and bravery in the face of gender and class bias drive this beautifully shot documentary from directors Rintu Thomas and Sushmit Ghosh.Black Ticket Films (PBS)“Mariupol: The People’s Story”    True to the documentary film’s title, the testimonials featured in Mariupol: The People’s Story collectively chronicle the way a once-bustling European center was ravaged in a matter of weeks as Russian forces gained ground and hoped to throttle the Ukrainian city’s services. Composed almost entirely of footage shot by residents who stayed and who bore the brunt of such attacks—with heartbreaking images of shelled buildings and abandoned corpses on the streets—Robin Barnwell’s documentary is an important assemblage of what was one of the most harrowing episodes in the still raging war taking place on Ukrainian soil.Top Hat Productions / Hayloft Productions (BBC Select)“The Rebellious Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks”            This necessary documentary film from SO’B Productions demands a reckoning with the historical record of the life of Rosa Parks, and shows the depth, courage, and determination of Black resistance to anti-Black racism and white racial terror. Challenging the historical confinement to symbolic celebrations of Mrs. Parks, the film shows her as a central architect and activist at the center of the Civil Rights movement.SO’B Productions (Peacock)“The Territory”       At the heart of the Amazon rainforest, the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau people are fighting the encroaching deforestation that threatens not just their lives and livelihood but that of the entire globe. Their efforts are here captured by a documentary intent on amplifying their plight and uplifting the tireless work of activists and indigenous groups that refuse to capitulate to the capitalist violence inherent in seeing land not as something sacred but as something to be exploited for short-term gain.National Geographic Documentary Films Presents A Documist And Associação Jupaú Film in association with Time Studios, Xtr, Doc Society Climate Story Fund / A Production of Protozoa Pictures, Passion Pictures, Real Lava (Disney+)“We Need To Talk About Cosby”             For decades, no figure shaped America’s perception of Black life with as much authority as Bill Cosby. His eponymous sitcom wasn’t just a massive commercial success; it also opened the door for countless other television series focused on Black characters. And yet, W. Kamau Bell’s deeply personal docuseries takes up the troubling quandary of Cosby in modern times, given all we now know about him—the man, the entertainment phenomenon, the paragon of respectability politics, and the predator.SHOWTIME Documentary Films Presents, A Boardwalk Pictures Production, In Association With WKB Industries (Showtime Networks)ENTERTAINMENT“Abbott Elementary”Through deliciously funny, unfailingly thoughtful storylines, the mockumentary-style sitcom brings both depth and levity to its depiction of a grade school in Philadelphia, where a plucky group of educators work to ensure their students receive the best schooling possible, even as they face the kinds of challenges that are endemic to low-income districts. The show isn’t content to present funny scenarios absent any social context; Abbott Elementary insists on surfacing the structural issues that make its teachers’ work so hard.Delicious Non-Sequitur Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television and 20th Television, a part of Disney Television Studios (ABC)“Andor”Few other long-running franchises loom as large in today’s contemporary pop cultural imagination than Star Wars. Yet amid stories of destiny-driven heroes and doomed superpowered villains, Tony Gilroy’s Andor tackles that familiar galaxy with plenty of spectacle, but also a keen-eyed commitment to mirroring our own mundane trials and tribulations as it follows scavenger Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), who unwittingly becomes radicalized in the wake of a police state intent on crushing any and all signs of the Rebel Alliance.Lucasfilm Ltd. (Disney+)“Atlanta”The experimental series, in which Donald Glover plays a shiftless Princeton dropout trying to manage his cousin’s burgeoning rap career, won a Peabody for its first season in 2016 for its sharp, evocative depiction of its eponymous city and the cast of characters making their way through it. Now, in its final seasons, the groundbreaking series has transcended its original success by introducing an anthology-style structure in Season 3 that deviates largely from the central cast, allowing the final two installments of Atlanta to display a wealth of creativity and insight.FX Productions (FX)“Bad Sisters”On its face, Bad Sisters, the dark comedy from Catastrophe co-creator Sharon Horgan, is a whodunit about the death of John Paul Williams, a man who torments not only his wife, Grace, but also her four sisters. When the embattled quartet decides the only path to saving Grace from John Paul’s abuse is to kill him, they embark on a perilous, oft-thwarted journey, but the heart of the show is its keen, loving attention to relationships among women.Merman / ABC Signature in association with Apple (Apple TV+)“Better Call Saul”It is a remarkable thing for a spinoff to surpass the artistic terms of its predecessor, even more so when that predecessor is as excellent as Breaking Bad, but that’s precisely what Better Call Saul did by the end of its six seasons. Featuring an array of career-best performances from a cast anchored by the quintet of Bob Odenkirk, Rhea Seehorn, Jonathan Banks, Giancarlo Esposito, and Michael Mando, all operating within an impeccable creative infrastructure led by Peter Gould with Vince Gilligan, the show serves as a vibrant interrogation of its forebear as well as a closing chapter to an era of prestige television defined by male antiheroes like Walter White.High Bridge, Crystal Diner, Gran Via Productions and Sony Pictures Television (AMC)“Los Espookys”Primarily a Spanish-language comedy with English subtitles, this half-hour American series pays homage to Latin America’s passion for the paranormal and Hollywood’s love of horror, all inside a deadpan comedy with telenovela influences, created and written by Julio Torres, Ana Fabrega, and Fred Armisen. Cassandra Ciangherotti, Bernardo Velasco, Torres, Fabrega, and Armisen play a group of misfits who bond over their shared love of the macabre and turn their penchant for horror and gore into a start-up businessHBO in association with Broadway Video, Antigravico and Mas Mejor (HBO Max)“Mo”Mo, starring and co-created by Mo Amer (alongside Ramy Youssef), is a hilarious exploration of what it means to move through the world (or, well, Houston, Texas) as an asylum-seeking refugee, with the constant knowledge that your entire life may well disappear from one day to the next. Sure, he may now float from job to job in order to avoid ICE raids, and his mother still bristles whenever her son brings home his girlfriend Maria (Teresa Ruiz), but throughout this Netflix comedy, the humor comes from telling a wholly American story whose absurdity is only matched by its authenticity.A24 (Netflix)“Pachinko”When Min Jin Lee’s book Pachinko was first published in 2017, the life and family history of main character Sunja—which spans much of the twentieth century and captures a history of colonialism and immigration in Japan, Korea, and the United States—gripped readers who welcomed such a complex tale of being and belonging. Adapting the bestseller for the small screen, Soo Hugh developed Pachinko into a handsome period piece that tenderly traces an intergenerational saga that begins in Japan-occupied Korea in the 1920s and splinters its aching melodrama plots in the lifetimes that follow, playfully putting that titular matching game at its center.Media Res / Blue Marble Pictures in association with Apple (Apple TV+)“Severance”In this prescient Apple TV+ series, director and executive producer Ben Stiller and creator Dan Erickson, along with their brilliant cast, probe what it means to live a meaningful life if given the choice of separating our work and non-work lives. Severance details the emotional and psychological effects of the micro practices of discipline and control that its characters endure. And yet at its most hopeful, Severance examines the desire for meaning, the emotional power of memory, the bonds of social attachment, and the urge to rebel against subjugation and control.Fifth Season / Red Hour Productions in association with Apple (Apple TV+)“We’re Here”Whenever Shangela, Bob the Drag Queen, and Eureka O’Hara alight on any given town during any one episode of HBO’s docuseries We’re Here, their purpose is clear: all three queens are eager to preach the gospel of drag. Drag isn’t a mask you hide behind, as they suggest with every new transformation of a local trio tasked with performing at the end of every episode; it’s a way to reveal who you really are.HBO in association with House of Opus 20 and IPC (HBO Max)INTERACTIVE AND IMMERSIVE“ContraPoints”Through her YouTube channel, ContraPoints, Natalie Wynn defies simplicity, having developed a following of more than one million subscribers by producing long video essays that dissect trending topics and social phenomena, from “Canceling” to “Cringe,” “Incels” to “JK Rowling.” Using history, theory, pop culture references, and comedic acting, she helps us understand the deeper nuances of what’s trending.Natalie Wynn (YouTube)“Life is Strange: True Colors”Life is Strange: True Colors centers on the story of a 21-year-old bisexual Asian American woman, Alex Chen, who has spent the last eight years in foster care—a radical departure from whose stories are typically told in AAA video games. Shortly after witnessing the tragic death of her brother, Alex uncovers conspiracies that lead her to question the town’s history and what she knows about her own family. The development team created a diverse and inclusive game, seeking out consultants, including mental health professionals, to ensure that the characters and themes were authentic and respectful, while using a combination of traditional motion capture and performance capture to produce more realistic and nuanced character animations.Deck Nine Games & Square Enix External Studios (PC, Xbox, PlayStation, Stadia)“Lucy and the Wolves in the Walls”Through the endearing and earnest narrative of Lucy and the Wolves in the Walls, Fable Studio deftly invites us to shift our perspective—to see the world as experienced by its eight-year-old protagonist, Lucy, through an interactive VR journey that continues across multiple platforms. As the young girl’s imaginary friend, we are invisible to all other characters in her life, but for Lucy we are witness, confidant, and fellow explorer. Central to Lucy’s story is the delicate balance of truth, evidence, and belief; and at its heart, a celebration of wonder.Fable Studio, Third Rail Projects, Sound+Design, Story Studio & Experiences (Oculus Rift, Oculus Quest)“Reeducated”China’s brutal and systemic detention of Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang is well-documented, but there exists little photographic evidence from inside the camps, which has effectively limited Western journalistic coverage of what is likely the largest mass-internment drive of ethnic and religious minorities since the Second World War. A two-part project that comprises a VR documentary and an interactive feature, Reeducated uses testimony, hand-drawn illustration, and immersive video technology to record the atrocities and conditions inside the walls of the camp.The New Yorker (Oculus, Mobile, Desktop)“The Uncensored Library”A meticulous, artistically-rendered Minecraft build, The Uncensored Library is a monument to press freedom and an innovative back door for access to censored content. Leveraging Minecraft’s availability in countries where other media is blocked, The Uncensored Library has allowed more than 20 million gamers in 165 countries to access censored articles, available in English and the original language, from acclaimed independent journalists under threat by the authoritative regimes of places such as Saudi Arabia, Russia, Mexico, Egypt, and Vietnam.Media.Monks, Reporters without Borders, DDB Germany (Minecraft)NEWS“Guns in America”In 2022, as a shooting at a Texas school and a grocery store in upstate New York joined the ever-growing list of mass shootings, and with meaningful solutions nowhere in sight, PBS NewsHour dedicated an unprecedented amount of resources, airtime, and focus to the issue. Ranging from on-the-ground updates in Uvalde and survivor interviews in Buffalo, to long-range impact stories around the tenth anniversary of the movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado, to a deep dive into the psychology behind gun marketing, NewsHour continually found groundbreaking angles to every gun story.PBS NewsHour (PBS NewsHour)“FRONTLINE: Michael Flynn’s Holy War”This profile documentary from FRONTLINE in collaboration with The Associated Press, doggedly reported over several years, follows General Michael Flynn as he travels across America speaking to growing crowds on the far right. Refusing to see him as an outlier, let alone a fanatical fringe figure, the film conveys a sense of foreboding as Flynn and his followers make plans for 2024 and beyond, with veiled threats as to what might happen “next time,” placing his religious extremist operation at the heart of American politics.FRONTLINE (PBS) with The Associated Press (PBS)“FRONTLINE: Ukraine: Life Under Russia’s Attack”In February 2022, Russia launched a military assault on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, and the Ukrainians refused to surrender. Filmed during the first three months of the unprovoked invasion, Ukraine: Life Under Russia’s Attack provides a powerful inside portrait of the civilians and first responders who chose not to evacuate but to remain and defend the city, refusing to hand their country over to Vladimir Putin and taking a stand for democracy in the process.FRONTLINE (PBS) with Channel 4“The Gap: Failure to Treat, Failure to Protect”This six-part series from KARE11 in Minneapolis exemplifies the best of enterprising local journalism, diagnosing and documenting a major failing in the Minnesota legal system: suspects in crimes are routinely deemed mentally incompetent to stand trial but are never treated for their mental illness. The careful and compelling reporting, which centered a mass local shooting but took in the wider scope of the problem, prompted action from state legislators, resulting in a change to Minnesota laws regarding competency and treatment.KARE-TV (NBC/KARE-TV)“No Justice for Women in the Taliban’s Afghanistan”The impactful and revealing No Justice for Women in the Taliban’s Afghanistan is the result of a VICE News investigation across north and south Afghanistan, which explores the present-day plight—and troublesome future—of a new generation of girls growing up under Taliban rule. Examining the lack of education, healthcare, economic opportunity, and justice, reporter Isobel Yeung weaves together a harrowing and affecting picture of oppression in post-war Afghanistan, where the “new” Taliban swear they are different from their 20th Century predecessors but prove to be anything but.VICE News (VICE News)“One Day in Hebron”For AJ+ Senior Presenter Dena Takruri, arriving in the Palestinian city of Hebron was a vexing homecoming, knowing she wouldn’t find there the lively city her father had known in his youth before leaving for the United States. Capturing her own team’s clash with armed officers in the Israeli settler-occupied urban center and with neighbors intent on making Palestinian residents and visitors alike feel unwelcome (if not outright unsafe), One Day in Hebron offers an unvarnished look at what it means to live cloistered within militarized streets that circumscribe the lives of those within its walled borders.AJ+ (Direct From)“Shimon Prokupecz: Unraveling Uvalde”On May 24, 2022, an eighteen-year-old walked into Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, and killed 19 children and two teachers. Law enforcement inaction may well have further contributed to the tragedy at the school; the team at CNN, led by Shimon Prokupecz, covered this story with a commitment to getting accountability for the many families who had to contend with the fact that their kids, some of whom didn’t make it out of the school alive, had to wait close to an hour before officers actively responded to the 911 calls coming from inside those classrooms.CNN (CNN)PODCAST/RADIO“Stolen: Surviving St. Michael’s”Journalist Connie Walker and her team resurface the obscured past of Canada’s “Indian residential school system,” which was developed to forcibly assimilate scores of Indigenous children into white Christian society, including Walker’s own father. An arresting blend of family history and investigative journalism, this podcast ventures far beyond the findings of Canada’s official Truth and Reconciliation Commission to pull together a new basis for the historical record.Spotify & Gimlet Media (Spotify)“The Divided Dial”“The Divided Dial,” reported and hosted by journalist Katie Thornton and edited by Katya Rogers, Executive Producer of WNYC’s On the Media, offers listeners a sobering window into the rise of Salem Media Group, a conservative Christian radio network that has steadily grown from fringe player to a formidable custodian of power and influence over the political right within the last few decades. Synthesizing dogged business reporting with a clear sense of how right-wing talk radio has fundamentally reshaped the Republican Party, Thornton and Rogers have produced a remarkable, vital, and unparalleled document that outlines the uneasy conflict over truth in American civic life.On the Media/New York Public Radio (New York Public Radio)“This American Life: The Pink House at the Center of the World”On the day the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, This American Life had exclusive access inside the clinic at the center of the legal case, Mississippi’s last abortion clinic, witnessing what happened as staff received the news—and then hurried to see all the patients scheduled for the next month in just ten days, before the ban went into effect. “The Pink House at the Center of the World” offers a comprehensive and compelling snapshot of this turning point in America, always maintaining its focus on the human lives and stories at its core.This American Life (This American Life)PUBLIC SERVICE“FRONTLINE: The Power of Big Oil”Bold and illuminating, this three-part investigative documentary reveals how the fossil fuel industry over four decades manipulated climate change research, influenced environmental policy, and undermined efforts to confront the threat and impact of global warming. The Power of Big Oil draws on more than a year of reporting, reams of newly uncovered documents, and more than 100 interviews with key figures, including scientists employed inside and outside the industry, uncovering the missed opportunities to address an impending catastrophe.FRONTLINE (PBS) (PBS)",

        "title": "Tom Hanks Admits He’s Faked Being ‘Funny, Charming, and Loving’ on Set When ‘That’s the Last Way I Feel’",
        "content": "Tom Hanks is opening up about having less-than-perfect professionalism on set.The Oscar winner, who this week releases the novel “The Making of Another Major Motion Picture Masterpiece,” admitted to sometimes feeling pressured to maintain a certain level of “charming” composure in the past. The affable Hanks is perhaps best known by many as America’s Dad, but his new novel in part deconstructs that persona. The book charts the making of a fictional big-budget superhero movie with an eccentric director and a self-destructive lead actor who delays filming — something Hanks said he can relate to.“I have pulled every single one of those moments of behavior myself on a set,” Hanks told the BBC. “Not everybody is at their best every single day on a motion picture set.”The “Man Called Otto” actor continued, “I’ve had tough days trying to be a professional when my life has been falling apart in more ways than one and the requirement for me that day is to be funny, charming and loving – and it’s the last way I feel.”But Hanks called out the “cardinal sin” of delaying the length of the shoot or changing the budget, adding, “You will be amazed at how many people know that they can get away with it, and are told they can get away with it, because they are carrying the movie on their shoulders.”Hanks additionally addressed the mixed reviews for his book, noting that his “day job as a movie star” has made him “stronger when it comes down to really being torn apart.”The “Elvis” actor revealed that his novel was born after having “just run out of curiosity for the job” as an actor as a whole. “Sometimes you just have to have some other reason to spark your imagination,” Hanks summed up.The “Sleepless in Seattle” icon previously credited late filmmaker Nora Ephron for inspiring and encouraging him to write, even changing the script on set.“She told me I was a writer when I didn’t realize I was a writer,” he said during the “Q with Tom Power” podcast. “When we first met for ‘Sleepless in Seattle,’ I was a big shot. I had everybody telling me I was a big shot.”Hanks was so convinced of his own status in Hollywood that he told Ephron he disagreed with parts of the romantic comedy co-starring Meg Ryan. “I had this problem with it, and I had that problem with it…blah, blah, blah,” Hanks recalled. “Nora was very, very patient.” Hanks suggested changing the dialogue between his character and onscreen son (played by Ross Malinger) during a fight scene.“Once the movie came out, I said, ‘Hey, you know, that stuff was pretty funny.’ And Nora said, ‘Well, you wrote that,'” Hanks looked back. “I said, ‘No, I just said it, then you guys put it in the movie.’ And she said, ‘That’s what writing is!'”",

        "title": "Scarlett Johansson Says Getting Turned Down for ‘Gravity’ Left Her ‘Hopeless’",
        "content": "Scarlett Johansson questioned her acting career after being turned down for Alfonso Cuarón‘s “Gravity.”The “Lost in Translation” actress reflected on her trajectory in a new interview with Variety, citing the devastating loss of being turned down for the Oscar-winning space epic. Marion Cotillard and Natalie Portman also screen-tested for the lead role of a scientist trapped in space, and Blake Lively and Johansson were considered before Sandra Bullock was ultimately cast in the Best Actress-nominated part.“I got turned down for two roles — the first was ‘Iron Man 2’ and then the other one was Alfonso Cuarón’s ‘Gravity,'” Johansson said. “I had wanted that role so much. It was sort of the straw that broke the camel’s back. I felt really frustrated and hopeless. Like, ‘Am I doing the right job?'”Johansson continued, “The work I was being offered felt deeply unfulfilling. I think I was offered every Marilyn Monroe script ever. I was like, ‘Is this the end of the road creatively?'”The star admitted it was “hard to get out of that pigeonhole” of playing an onscreen bombshell. “And I did films like ‘He’s Just Not That Into You’ and movies that kind of continued that narrative,” Johansson said. “I couldn’t make any headway.”Eventually, Emily Blunt dropped out of “Iron Man 2” due to a contractual obligation with 20th Century Fox to film “Gulliver’s Travels.” Johansson instead stepped into the role of Black Widow, cementing her Marvel career turn. (Johansson’s “Iron Man 2” co-star Robert Downey Jr. was also briefly in talks on “Gravity” for the role that went to George Clooney.)“[‘Iron Man 2’] wasn’t going to move the needle forward in terms of how my character was written,” Johansson said of her brief appearance in “Iron Man 2,” “but there was potential for what it could be — a potential for growth in subsequent films.”She went on to star in nine MCU films, including the standalone spinoff “Black Widow.” In 2021, Johansson went to war with Disney when it shifted “Black Widow” to day-and-date streaming on Disney+, which meant Johansson losing out on back-end theatrical grosses. She sued Disney before eventually settling the lawsuit that netted her a reported $40-million-plus payday.Speaking with Variety, Johansson credited indie films “Under the Skin” and “Her” for a mid-2010s career resurgence.“Suddenly it was like, ‘I still love this job,'” Johansson said. “And it reignited my passion for the work. I felt less anxious.”Johansson is next set to star in Wes Anderson’s “Asteroid City,” Kristin Scott Thomas’ “My Mother’s Wedding,” Sebastián Lelio’s “Bride,” and is rumored to be attached to Greg Berlanti’s “Project Artemis.”",

        "title": "Patricia Clarkson Doesn’t Know Why She Loves Playing Mothers in Crisis Either",
        "content": "Patricia Clarkson is no stranger to playing a mother in turmoil.She earned an Oscar nomination for her performance as a woman perhaps oxymoronically named Joy and dealing with breast cancer in “Pieces of April” (2003). On the small screen, she earned an Emmy nomination for portraying Adora, a bitterly faded Southern belle with Munchausen by proxy syndrome in “Sharp Objects” (2018). Now, in director/co-writer Andrea Pallaoro’s “Monica,” she plays Eugenia, a Midwestern mother dying of brain cancer and now getting reacquainted as best she can with her estranged daughter (Trace Lysette), who is trans.In “Pieces of April,” “I was a very present, very feisty woman. [With ‘Monica’], I’m considerably older. I’m 20 years older. She really is on borrowed time,” Clarkson said in a recent interview with IndieWire. As for preparing to play a woman physically and psychologically succumbing to the terminal illness, she added, “I’ll tell you this: the preparation, first of all, it was bourbon. No, kidding. A few nights, maybe.”Co-written by Orlando Tirado, the elegantly Antonioni-esque “Monica” first premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival to an 11-minute standing ovation. In this spare and unsentimental drama, trans actress and “Transparent” breakout Lysette plays the title character, a sex worker in Los Angeles who, shattered by a recent breakup, gets a call from her sister-in-law (Emily Browning) that changes everything. She’s soon entreated her to come home to Ohio to share some parting final moments and words with her mother Eugenia, who has stopped taking her meds, is losing her memory, rarely speaks, and is in the final stages of her cancer.Marvelously, “Monica” doesn’t center around some kind of tragic trans redemption narrative concomitant with a more Hollywood story; the movie, as IndieWire’s Jude Dry noted in their review, “neither ignores nor obsesses over the character’s trans-ness.”“It’s so interesting that now this film of course has taken on a real importance with the idiocies happening in our country with transgender assault,” said Clarkson, a proud Southerner, noting the wave of anti-trans and anti-queer legislature rippling through the country.Back at Venice, Clarkson told a journalist she was still a little scarred by playing a woman deprived of her mental faculties because of illness, but “my trepidations about playing this part pale in comparison” to the real issues “Monica” seeks to address.“To play someone who is dying in front of your eyes, someone who is really in the very last chapter of their life, is daunting as an actor, because you need to get things right. You have to take on how it affects the body, the soul, but you also have to let your body take over and your mind kind of literally fade away,” said Clarkson, who first met director Pallaoro while she was on a jury at 2013 Marrakech Film Festival (Martin Scorsese and Paolo Sorrentino were also among the jurors). They promised to work together, stayed in touch, until years later when Pallaoro came to her with “Monica” and Lysette in the cast.“First of all, it was very flattering. That gorgeous woman, you think I’m her mother?,” Clarkson said with a laugh. “I’m dying, and I can’t wear any makeup!”Clarkson said the movie “wrestled” for a while until the financing came together — and a “great tax break in Cincinnati,” where “Monica” finally shot on film and in the Academy ratio. (“This is true cinema … you haven’t seen a movie shot on film since prehistoric times.”)“Getting a transgender film made is difficult,” Clarkson said. “I had a deep and profound love for this project, but that carried me and kept me someone buoyant in the midst of this darkness I had to enter.”Eugenia requires a great deal of care from those around her, and this creates the conditions for Monica to pose as a hospice worker. Eugenia doesn’t recognize Monica as her own child, whom she sent out of their home many years ago, presumably because of Monica’s trans-ness and before Monica transitioned.“There also was the beauty of a mother realizing your child is your child is your child is your child and taking on this incredibly important subject matter,” Clarkson said.With Eugenia, the relaxed and unpretentious Clarkson also finds it curious that she gravitates to maternal roles — and ones with an acute ambivalence toward motherhood in general — when she herself has famously never been married, never had children, and never wanted either.“I knew from a very early age that I did not want to marry, that marriage was not something I had to do or necessarily would do, as a Southern woman, a straight Southern woman,” she said. “Yes, of course, my parents wanted it, but I have cool parents. My mother ran the city of New Orleans. She’s a powerhouse.”From her Emmy-winning turn as a free-spirit would-have-been artist in HBO’s “Six Feet Under” to a Manhattan divorcee in the film “Learning to Drive,” Clarkson embodies women who rebuke patriarchy and decorum, instead saying what’s really on their mind. (Most recently on the big screen, she played New York Times investigations editor Rebecca Corbett in “She Said,” an instrumental figure in revealing Harvey Weinstein as a serial rapist and sexual predator.) But there’s not some reservoir of personal experience she’s tapping into.“I’ve had really exceptional men in my life, not all of them, but quite a few. So I’ve had profound relationships in my life that I really value still but I do think it’s interesting that I am so far from this life of marriage and child and yet I am always playing these characters within that life,” she said. “I do have parents who’ve been married 70 years, we just celebrated. My sisters are married. A lot of my friends are married. I am surrounded, it’s lousy with marriage around me, it’s just every day, marriage! I think they imprint on me in some ways, but I think I’m empathetic, but I also have a certain kind of reserve about it that maybe helps me play these women in a certain way. I’m not quite sure because I have loved, I’ve had loss, I’ve had heartbreak, I’ve had all of the things that go with a relationship, I just haven’t had the actual marriage certificate.”But Clarkson knows she’s not the centerpiece of “Monica,” which is really Lysette’s story and hinges on Lysette’s performance — and that’s why Clarkson feels such passionate advocacy for it. Humanistic and progressive views of sexual identity are increasingly laundered into mainstream projects that otherwise ignore them, leaving the real responsibility on independent projects like “Monica.” She’s optimistic that, despite being an indie film with a small cast and limited means, “Monica” has a chance to break out.“Will it break because it’s so topical now? It is about a family, it’s a family movie in an odd way, is it possibly a movie that can break through? And that’s what I’m hoping, is that somehow the bigger critics in this town, in New York and LA who are now seeing it for the first time but they didn’t review it then, really embrace it and give it a thrust out in the world and hopefully, you know, people are viewing it,” she said. “We are now opening in quite a few theaters, it’s exciting it was just New York and LA, now it’s other cities … so I am hoping that maybe just the beauty of this film and the importance of this film really kind of help it lift up and out. That’s my wish.”An IFC Films release, “Monica” opens Friday, May 12 in New York at IFC Center and in LA at the Nuart. More dates to follow. Watch an exclusive clip from the film below.",

        "content": "“Portrait of a Lady on Fire” actress Adèle Haenel is calling out the French film industry for supporting known sexual abusers.Haenel wrote an op-ed letter for French publication Télérama in which she denounced the “general complacency” toward “sexual aggressors” like actor Gerard Depardieu, who was recently accused of sexual misconduct by 13 women, and director Roman Polanski, who raped then-13-year-old Samantha Geimer in 1977.“They join hands [to protect] the [Gerard] Depardieus, the [Roman] Polanskis, the [Dominique] Boutonnats,” Haenel wrote (via The Hollywood Reporter). “It bothers them that the victims make too much noise. They preferred that we disappear and die in silence.”Doubling down on her retirement from movies, she added that the French industry has effectively “canceled” its own #MeToo movement over the years, writing, “You have the money, the strength, and all the glory [but] you won’t have me as a spectator. I cancel you from my world.”Haenel previously accused French director Christophe Ruggia of sexually assaulting her when she was 12 years old on the set of “The Devils.” Ruggia denied the 2020 charges and has yet to face trial after being formally indicted. That same year, Haenel walked out of the César Awards when Polanski was awarded the best director prize for “An Officer and a Spy”; Haenel yelled “shame!” while leaving alongside “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” director Céline Sciamma. Haenel has not appeared onscreen since the 2019 queer period piece.In 2022, Haenel first announced she was exiting the film industry as a whole.“I don’t make films anymore because of political reasons,” Haenel said at the time. “Because the film industry is absolutely reactionary, racist, and patriarchal. We are mistaken if we say that the powerful are of goodwill, that the world is indeed moving in the right direction under their good and sometimes unskillful management. Not at all. The only thing that moves society structurally is social struggle. And it seems to me that in my case, to leave is to fight. By leaving this industry for good, I want to take part in another world, in another cinema.”Haenel concluded, “If I stayed today in this film industry, I would be a kind of feminist guarantee to this masculine and patriarchal industry. My dream is to make it clear: This industry defends a capitalist, patriarchal, racist, sexist world of structural inequality. This means that this industry works hand in hand with the global economic order, in which all lives are not equal.”",

        "content": "Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes is separating herself from the fictionalized portrayals of her personal, professional, and criminal life.Convicted fraudster Holmes gave a controversial interview with The New York Times seemingly as part of a personal rebrand as a new mother of two.“I made so many mistakes and there was so much I didn’t know and understand, and I feel like when you do it wrong, it’s like you really internalize it in a deep way,” Holmes said of founding Silicon Valley blood-testing company Theranos and infamously channeling Steve Jobs with a deep voice and black turtleneck uniform. “I believed it would be how I would be good at business and taken seriously and not taken as a little girl or a girl who didn’t have good technical ideas. Maybe people picked up on that not being authentic, since it wasn’t.”Holmes addressed Emmy-winning limited series “The Dropout” starring Amanda Seyfried and the Adam McKay film “Bad Blood,” which Jennifer Lawrence dropped out of in November 2022.“They’re not playing me,” Holmes said when asked about the Lawrence movie. “They’re playing a character I created.”She continued, “If we let how other people might view that, or what impression someone might make of it dictate how we live our lives, then we’ve lost. Finding your person in the middle of all of this and experiencing that love when you’re going through hell is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever experienced.”Holmes pointed to former business partner and ex-boyfriend Sunny Balwani for advising her to take on a different persona.“He always told me I needed to ‘kill Elizabeth,’ so I could become a good entrepreneur,” Holmes said. “It was only when people started to raise questions about the company that I started to see that he was not who I thought he was in business. And then that made me start to question everything else.”She added, “Even though that period was a crisis and Theranos was my life and like my child, I gave everything I had to it,” noting that she “became free” after the company went under.The Holmes interview in the Times was roundly accused on social media over the weekend as being a puff piece.McKay’s “Bad Blood” film was confirmed in January 2021 by would-be lead star Lawrence, who was set to transform into Holmes for the adaptation of true crime book of the same name by Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou, charting the rise and fall of shady Silicon Valley medical start-up Theranos.New York Times journalist Kyle Buchanan tweeted after the publication of an interview with “Causeway” star Lawrence that she would no longer play Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes in Adam McKay’s “Bad Blood” film.“She came to that conclusion after watching Amanda Seyfried play Holmes in ‘The Dropout,'” Buchanan wrote, adding Lawrence said, “I thought she was terrific. I was like, ‘Yeah, we don’t need to redo that.’ She did it.”",

        "title": "‘Dungeons & Dragons’ Leads VOD, While ‘A Man Called Otto’ Takes the #1 Netflix Slot",
        "content": "Just after a reported first quarter loss of $1.23 billion, Paramount has something to cheer this week. “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” ($19.99), released after its fifth weekend in theaters, is #1 on all VOD charts.Reading the tea leaves that studios provide to figure out strategies is confusing. Paramount two weeks ago released “Scream VI” ($19.99) on both their own streaming platform and on PVOD. The much bigger-grossing horror film only reached #1 at Vudu (which ranks by revenue, not transactions), and at the end of its second week, only shows up on one of the three top ten lists.As always, we are in the dark about the revenues a film ranked at #1 takes in. We do know that at a $19.99 price, Paramount recoups around $14/transaction. It appears they conceded much of that for “Scream VI,” hoping that it boosted the Paramount+ subscription interest. Again, this is mostly a mystery, though it is logical to assume its play there got a lot of viewing and possibly more subscribers.At the same time, Sony, the only one of the top five studios to not have an in-house streaming platform, continues to provide #1 ranked films on the Netflix top ten. “A Man Called Otto,” coming there only four months after its wide release, follows “Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,” which was #1 two weeks ago.Other than “D&D” taking over at #1, three other new titles joined the top ten. Both “Renfield” (Universal) and “The Pope’s Exorcist” (Sony) were released after three weekends in theaters, both at $19.99. That was normal for Universal, but atylical for Sony. Neither film opened to over $10 million, and both fell quickly, making the moves logical.Of note — despite Nicolas Cage’s consistent popularity on home platforms, the Russell Crowe-starring “Exorcist” performed better across the board on PVOD than “Renfield.” That might change when the price is lowered in a few weeks. His “The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent” had a much more sustained run as a lower-priced VOD film.“Beautiful Disaster” (Voltage), an American-set but filmed in Bulgaria college romantic drama, also debuted this week on all three charts at $6.99. This comes after it played two weeknights last month as a Fathom event. The home viewing response suggests that kind of play elevated interest.Long-time playing “Avatar: The Way of Water” (reduced to $12.99) and “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” ($19.99), both Disney, plus “Creed III” (MGM) completed the unusually high number (seven) of films to place across the board. A curious newcomer was Apple’s “The Tomorrow Man” from 2019. Likely pushed because of Chris Pratt’s presence in last week’s new theatrical release “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” the unusual VOD play for an old made-for-streaming title showed up on iTunes chart (which, of course, is an Apple brand).It is sometimes said that a lot of people assume all movies are on Netflix. That’s never been true, and less so since four studios have set up the own streamers. But confusion is understandable when nine of the ten titles with the most views come from apart from Sony (“Otto”), also Universal (“Pitch Perfect,” “American Gangster,” “The Dilemma,””The Wedding Date,” and holding the rights to “The Croods” now), Paramount (“G.I. Joe: Retaliation”), Warner Bros. Discovery (“Heat”), and Lionsgate (“The Glass Castle”). That’s all but Disney. “Pitch Perfect” took first place before “Otto” took over.Some of these come from long term deals, but it’s beginning to look like some studios are happy to take Netflix’s cash for at least short-term streaming exclusivity rather than include them for their own subscribers.

        "content": "[Spoiler Alert: The following post contains numerous spoilers for “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3“]Comic book movies aren’t often thought to be vehicles for social change, but People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals disagrees.The organization announced today it’s given a Not a Number Award to director James Gunn for his depiction of the cruelties of animal testing in “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.” In a statement, PETA said the award recognized Gunn’s “unflinching advocacy” in the film, “reminding viewers that all animals deserve a life of freedom under the open sky rather than confinement to laboratory cages.”Much of “Vol. 3” concerns the backstory of Rocket (Bradley Cooper), a sentient raccoon given consciousness (and mad fighting skills) by enduring horrific pain in a lab — sure, he becomes aware, but only to be haunted by the memories of his torment. Not a fair tradeoff. And many of his fellow animals were killed in that lab, such as the adorable otter Lylla, the walrus Teefs, and the rabbit Floor. In the course of the film, he avenges them while freeing others.In a press release praising the film, PETA says that the way Rocket is referred to by a number when he’s in the lab reflects “a practice animal experimenters use to dissociate from the sentient being they’re tormenting.”“Through Rocket, James Gunn has put a face, a name, and a personality on the millions of vulnerable animals being cycled through laboratories as we speak,” said PETA Senior Vice President Lisa Lange. “PETA is celebrating this as the best animal rights film of the year for helping audiences see animals as individuals and suggesting that just because we can experiment on them doesn’t mean that we should.”PETA goes on in its statement to say, “Like Rocket’s friends Lylla, Teefs, and Floor, most animals used in laboratories are killed after enduring a lifetime of suffering. They’re held in cramped cages, often alone, and mutilated, infected with diseases, purposely bred to suffer from debilitating conditions, forced to endure multiple painful procedures, locked into restraint devices, bombarded with stimuli for prolonged periods, and frequently denied adequate food, water, and pain relief. And even though the National Institutes of Health spends nearly $20 billion per year in taxpayer funding on animal testing, studies have shown that 95% of all new drugs that test safe and effective in animals fail in human clinical trials because they don’t work or are dangerous.”In a blog post on their site, PETA doesn’t just praise Gunn, it praises how Gunn got the details about animal testing right, such as showing how animals in labs are often tattooed with numbers on their chests (the way Rocket and Lylla are). And Rocket is restrained at one point in a device very much like those used to restrain primates in labs.“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” is in theaters now.",

        "title": "‘The Zone of Interest’ First Look: Jonathan Glazer Returns with First Feature Since ‘Under the Skin’",
        "content": "Jonathan Glazer is back on the big screen.The “Under the Skin” director returns for his first feature in 10 years with “The Zone of Interest,” based on Martin Amis’ 2014 novel. The period piece follows Rudolf Höss (Christian Friedel), the commandant of Auschwitz, and his wife Hedwig (Sandra Hüller) who both strive to build a dream life for their family in the garden next to the concentration camp. The novel charts a love triangle with a Nazi officer who falls in love with Hedwig; the story is told from the perspective of three characters, one being a Jewish Sonderkommando.Max Beck, Ralph Herforth, Stephanie Petrowitz, Sascha Maaz, Marie Rosa Tietjen, and Lilli Falk also star.Łukasz Żal, the Oscar-nominated cinematographer of Pawel Pawlikowski’s “Ida” and “Cold War,” serves as the director of photography, with Paul Watts editing. The A24 film will be scored by composer Mica Levi. Glazer and Levi have collaborated together on the short films “Strasbourg 1518” and “The Fall” since first teaming up for “Under the Skin,” the cult classic starring Scarlett Johansson as an alien sent to Earth on a mysterious mission. Micachu musician Mica Levi’s unsettling and discordant “Under the Skin” score is frequently listed among the best original film soundtracks of the 21st century.“The Zone of Interest” marks Glazer’s fourth feature following “Under the Skin,” “Sexy Beast,” and “Birth.” This film is set to premiere in competition at Cannes, marking Glazer’s first contention for the Palme d’Or throughout his decades-long career.Glazer previously said on the “A Dash of Drash” podcast that the drama will be tonally very different from other Holocaust films like “Schindler’s List” and “Son of Saul.”“I remember being very taken by the faces of the bystanders, the onlookers, the complicit, you know? Ordinary Germans. I started wondering how it would be possible to stand by and watch that,” Glazer said. “Some of the faces actually enjoy it, the spectacle of it, the kind of circus of it.”Glazer added in a 2019 interview that he wanted to capture the “ever-present” fear of modern politics in his recent projects, namely short “The Fall,” which was inspired by President Trump.“I think fear is ever-present, and that drives people to irrational behavior,” Glazer said. “A mob encourages an abdication of personal responsibility. The rise of National Socialism in Germany for instance was like a fever that took hold of people. We can see that happening again.”",

        "title": "‘Scarlet’ Trailer: ‘Martin Eden’ Filmmaker Pietro Marcello Directs a Jacques Demy-Esque Fairytale",
        "content": "Italian director Pietro Marcello made a splash at the 2019 Venice Film Festival with the Jack London adaptation “Martin Eden.” That film about an idealistic man’s sentimental and moral education at the turn of the 20th century, distributed in the U.S. by Kino Lorber, more or less introduced the talents of heartthrob Luca Marinelli to Western audiences. Now, Marcello is partnering with the U.S. distributor once more, this time turning his camera on the story of a woman’s coming of age, with “Scarlet.” The cast includes Raphaël Thiéry, Louis Garrel, and newcomer Juliette Jouan. IndieWire shares the exclusive trailer for the film, which premiered at the 2022 Cannes Directors’ Fortnight, below.Per the official synopsis, shortly after World War I, veteran Raphaël (Raphaël Thiéry) returns home from the frontlines to find himself a widower and father to an infant daughter. Raised by her father in rural Normandy, the child Juliette (Juliette Jouan) grows into a lonely young girl who is passionate about singing and music and dreams of greater possibilities. She seeks refuge in the nearby woods, where she meets a witch who promises scarlet sails will one day take her away from her village. Reckoning with her future and swept away by a rakish young pilot (Louis Garrel) who literally falls from the sky, Juliette never stops believing in the witch’s prophecy. Tracing Juliette’s journey throughout the 20 years of great invention between the world wars, “Scarlet” delicately weaves together music and fantasy, history and folklore, realist drama and ethereal romance to craft a timeless story of a young woman’s emancipation.Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called the film “a fascinating, slippery movie filled with lyrical beauty, acts of barbarism, moments of magic and unexpected hope… As he did in ‘Martin Eden,’ Marcello takes an expansive, visually adventurous approach to a story about people and the historical forces that define, imprison and sometimes liberate them.”Scarlet is written by Marcello, Maurizio Braucci, and Maud Ameline from the 1923 Russian novel by Alexander Grin.Marcello’s previous film “Martin Eden” received multiple nominations at the 2021 Gotham Independent Film Awards after it was released in the United States. The film also won Marinelli the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 2019 Venice Film Festival.Kino Lorber opens “Scarlet” in New York on June 9, with more dates to follow nationwide.",

        "title": "Did You Catch the Albert Brooks, Hitchcock, and Jacques Tati References in ‘Beau Is Afraid’?",
        "content": "Anyone who has watched the Criterion Channel knows that writer-director Ari Aster is a devoted cinephile with broad taste and a deep understanding of how and why movies work. For his latest and most ambitious film, “Beau Is Afraid,” Aster told IndieWire’s Filmmaker Toolkit podcast that he tried to leave specific tributes to other movies behind, at least consciously. “I would say that a lot of the influences were unconscious while I was writing it,” he said. “I became aware of them while we were shooting, or even in post.” Aster and his regular cinematographer, Pawel Pogorzelski, talked more about literary references than cinematic ones, but there’s no denying that several of the classics that Aster has “metabolized,” as he put it, found their way into the visual and aural DNA of “Beau Is Afraid.” Here are three key films that influeced Aster and Pogorzelski’s approach.“Playtime“Jacques Tati’s 1967 comic masterpiece is a clear inspiration for “Beau Is Afraid,” both visually and tonally. “I definitely looked at the way that he created humor through set design, blocking, and camerawork,” Pogorzelski told IndieWire. Though “Playtime” is more playful and less anxiety-inducing than “Beau Is Afraid,” it sets up a similarly hostile environment for its protagonist. Tati’s Mr. Hulot is surrounded by modernist buildings made up of hard lines and stripped-down decor, with reflections and frames within frames that are extremely complex yet clear and accessible to the viewer. The first act of “Beau Is Afraid,” in which the title character (Joaquin Phoenix) is plagued by terrifying forces in and around his apartment, creates a similarly clean yet dense network of windows, doorways, and off-screen spaces in which sounds that utilize all the surround channels (just as Tati did in his 70mm epic) overwhelm our protagonist. Aster’s skillful juxtaposition of sound and image, in which sound effects are often missing, exaggerated, or moving through space at an abnormal speed, yields just as many laughs as Tati’s sophisticated construction, even if there’s a more frightening undercurrent.“Rear Window“Throughout “Beau Is Afraid,” there is a sense of Beau being watched and listened to by forces that probably don’t have his best interests in mind, which makes Alfred Hitchcock’s 1954 classic of voyeurism a logical reference point. According to Pogorzelski, it was Hitchcock’s palette that most influenced “Beau.” “We were looking at the color rendition and the kind of atmosphere that created,” he said. “Beau Is Afraid” doesn’t so much imitate Hitchcock’s palette — the closest it comes to replicating the warm browns and yellows of “Rear Window” is in the theatrical forest sequence around halfway through the film — as it adopts his technique of using color to elicit emotional responses in the audience. Each movement of the film has its own palette, with the opening sequence immediately putting the audience on edge with its abrasive mustard tones.Perhaps the most effective use of color comes in the sequence that follows, when Beau finds himself in the home of a superficially kind but inexplicably menacing family; the aggressive pastels of the bedroom in which he “recuperates” make this safe haven nearly as horrifying as the urban hellscape from which Beau has just escaped. In addition to the color, Aster builds on Hitchcock’s cinematic experiments with point of view; we are largely limited to what Beau sees and experiences, and, as in “Rear Window,” the rare occurrences where the audience becomes privy to information not available to the hero are pivotal toward the film’s building of suspense.“Defending Your Life“When Aster conceived the final scene of “Beau Is Afraid” — in which Beau is forced to defend himself and his choices in an arena filled with strangers — he had in mind Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s 1946 fantasy film “Stairway to Heaven” (aka “A Matter of Life and Death”). Once he looked at the scene during post-production, however, he realized another favorite film had found its way into the mix. “It occurred to me that the scene was nodding to ‘Defending Your Life,’ without my awareness,” he said. “That’s a film that’s very important to me, and I love it so much.” Brooks’ 1991 masterpiece portrays an afterlife in which the recently deceased sit in courtrooms (which, in a typically sly Brooksian metaphor, visually resemble the studio executives’ screening rooms where he had presumably spent his career being judged) and endure an assessment of their lives by attorneys and judges; in Aster’s film, the process is both more disturbing and more personal, with Beau’s own mother on the prosecution’s team. While the parallels between the final scene and “Defending Your Life” are obvious, the relationship between the two films runs deeper than that finale; like “Defending Your Life,” “Beau Is Afraid” is ultimately a philosophical meditation on how our lives are defined by fear and an inquiry into whether or not we can conquer fear or grow from it. Brooks’ film is ultimately life-affirming and romantic where Aster’s is brutally pessimistic, but the issues and the seriousness with which the filmmakers address them are consistent.",

        "title": "‘Oppenheimer’ Trailer: Cillian Murphy Self-Destructs in Fiery Christopher Nolan Epic",
        "content": "Christopher Nolan‘s highly-anticipated summer blockbuster is one step closer to exploding onscreen.The latest trailer for “Oppenheimer” captures the emotional implosion behind the father of the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), as he creates the ultimate weapon amid World War II. Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt, Kenneth Branagh, Rami Malek, Casey Affleck, Gary Oldman, James Remar, Josh Hartnett, and Alden Ehrenreich also star in the ensemble period piece.Based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Oppenheimer biography “American Prometheus,” the film is billed as a character study centered around the Manhattan Project. The 1945 bombings of Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki killed more than 200,000 people, many of them civilians. Physicist Oppenheimer later became an advocate for controlling nuclear power after creating the atomic bomb.Lead star Murphy opened up about the film being a “huge responsibility” to accurately represent Oppenheimer’s complexities.“[J. Robert Oppenheimer] was complicated and contradictory and so iconic,” Murphy said. “But you know you’re with one of the great directors of all time. I felt confident going into it with Chris [Nolan]. He’s had a profound impact on my life, creatively and professionally. He’s offered me very interesting roles over and I’ve found all of them really challenging. And I just love being on his sets.”Director Nolan recreated the first nuclear weapon detonation in the Trinity test without the use of computer graphics, which the “Tenet” helmer admitted was a “huge challenge to take on.”“Andrew Jackson — my visual effects supervisor, I got him on board early on — was looking at how we could do a lot of the visual elements of the film practically, from representing quantum dynamics and quantum physics to the Trinity test itself, to recreating, with my team, Los Alamos up on a mesa in New Mexico in extraordinary weather, a lot of which was needed for the film, in terms of the very harsh conditions out there – there were huge practical challenges,” Nolan shared. “It’s one of the most challenging projects I’ve ever taken on in terms of the scale of it, and in terms of encountering the breadth of Oppenheimer’s story.”“Oppenheimer” is the first feature film ever to be shot using a combination of IMAX black and white analog photography on 65mm and 65mm film photography. Nolan’s first feature with Universal Pictures, “Oppenheimer” clocks in at almost three hours.“Oppenheimer” premieres July 21 in theaters.

        "title": "Running a Movie Theater Is More Expensive Than You Can Possibly Imagine",
        "content": "Tell me if this sounds familiar: Why are there smudges on the screen? Is the picture supposed to be that dark? Does it sound like one of the speakers is out?  After more than a century, the core of the exhibition business remains unchanged: People go to a building where they buy a ticket to sit in a room with the lights off and watch a movie projected on an oversized screen. Until recently, improvements were analog and incremental. Today, technology creates the potential for near-constant improvement for the moviegoing experience — Lasers! 3-D! Chairs that move!However, every leap forward also means a prohibitive expense for theater owners who may be already struggling with the status quo.“Every one of us has to decide, how much capital can we throw at this problem, the problem being modernizing,” Tim Handren, CEO of Santikos Theaters in San Antonio told IndieWire. “You can’t fix it all in one year, so you have to get on a steady diet. The math is identical for all of us. The question is, what becomes a priority? Does it move faster, can I tolerate taking more of my profits and investing it into the future, or do I not have that luxury?”It’s been 10 years since American movie theaters moved on from 35mm film projectors to digital projection. Not that they had much choice: Studios shifted to digital delivery, which eliminated many of their exhibition costs like printing, cutting, and shipping film prints. For theaters, it meant spending as much as $150,000 to install some of the earliest digital projectors.Studios agreed to help amortize the costs with virtual print fees of about $100, paid to the exhibitors each time they opened a movie. Today, those fees have expired and the original digital projectors are out of date or failing outright, servers are crashing, and each service call demands a highly paid IT technician — presuming you can find one at all.Movie theaters have enough problems. With the box office still in post-pandemic recovery, AMC Theatres currently holds just under $5 billion in debt. Regal Cinemas’ parent company Cineworld is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and closing 39 locations nationwide.All of this introduces the last thing theaters need, which is an existential question: If the picture and sound quality that a movie theater promises isn’t there, why should the audience show up?“Sound and projection is one of those things that people take for granted,” Handren said. “They just assume it’s going to be great when they go, and if it’s not, they talk about it. But if it is great — great, you met expectations.”A 35mm film projector was a machine with a handful of parts. If one broke, theaters could be back up within a matter of hours. Today, a repair call demands an expert in the latest technology. Some exhibitors can afford in-house support, but it’s more common to draw from a pool of contractors in high demand. Worst-case scenario, that can mean days or weeks of a screen being down.“It becomes a feast or famine when you get hit with these big numbers,” said Brian Schultz, founder of LOOK Cinemas. “It’s a big deal when a projector goes down. It could be an $80,000-$90,000 investment, and that’s not including sound.”Exhibitors must choose between upgrading to costly laser projectors, installing premium large-format (PLF) screens, continually performing maintenance on aging machines — or, sacrificing quality altogether. The stuff that goes into making a movie look good is more expensive than most moviegoers can possibly imagine.“We all know that’s why popcorn and soda costs what it costs at a movie theater,” said Jeff Benson, founder of Cinergy Dine-In Cinemas. “You can’t make it on just the tickets. The cost to build that place and staff it is high. We’re not out there getting filthy rich; we’re just trying to make an honest living, and it’s not an easy business. The average customer has no idea what it costs to put together a movie theater. Their two hours sitting there in a recliner watching that awesome projection, they’re covering a little bit of the cost of that multi hundred-thousand dollar auditorium.”Theater owners know that if they can’t offer the experience of great picture, sound, and seating, it’s a tough sell.“I don’t think you can compete effectively if you don’t have all those dimensions,” Schultz said. “I’m seeing exhibitors do everything they can to be competitive. There’s a thirst for folks to come back. We really have one chance to make a great impression as people are coming back to the movies, and I still have a large percentage that hasn’t been back since Covid, so the presentation has to be great.”Not every theater has the cash for upgrades and maintenance. That’s especially true for exhibitors at larger circuits where the costs are multiplied by hundreds or thousands of screens.“For Adam Aron and AMC, he’s got over 7,000 screens in that whole network, so he’s got that problem times 7,000,” Handren said. “I’ve got 129 screens, so I’ve got that problem times 129. The math is the same, no matter how you look at it. It’s a problem for the big guys.”Joe Masher, CEO of Bow Tie Cinemas, said he has two screens with broken projectors. Each requires parts that cost $40,000. This particular multiplex has 14 screens; attendance hasn’t been high enough to demand all of them, so Masher said those two theaters remain “mothballed” until the repairs can make financial sense.“Maintaining a big multiplex is really, really costly, and there’s only so much you can do with ticket and concession pricing,” Masher said. “With the amount of content out right now, eight screens is a really good number. Eight to 10, maybe. Twelve is okay, but anything above that, theaters have a hard time filling seats. It’s really difficult.”Most screens still run “Gen-1” projectors, with maintenance costs that include replacing Xenon lamps (also referred to as bulbs), repairing technical equipment, and service fees to pay IT talent who do the repairs. However, Sony no longer services the oldest projector models. That leaves theater owners to “cannibalize” older projectors, stripping them for parts to service the rest of the fleet. Masher, who operates a fleet of 3-D projectors manufactured by a company that no longer exists, found a stockpile of parts to use as units begin to fail.“Before we had done some of our conversions, the maintenance was getting out of balance,” Handren said. “I know a lot of people doing that, just trying to be cost conscious and minimize how much they’re spending.”Masher, who is also the treasurer of the National Association of Theater Owners, helped break down some of the specific repair costs. These numbers can vary depending on the provider, the size of the screen, and other factors, but they were also verified by multiple other theater owners who spoke with IndieWire anonymously.Keep in mind that each of these costs apply for each screen in a theater.This helps convert the digital cinema package provided by a studio into data that can be projected with picture and sound. On average, these range from $7,000 to $14,000. On a higher-end Sony machine (which Sony calls an Optical Block) it can be as high as $40,000.These provide storage to hold multiple movies. Some theaters need less storage; others must maintain a larger library of content that lets them host private events or host multiple movies in a different auditorium. Replacing or repairing a server ranges from $12,000 to about $27,000 (on average, $15,000), and it can be more or less depending on if you have an integrated system that can connect throughout all your cinema’s screens. (A movie delivered via hard drive rather than through the cloud is $40 each in shipping costs.)Replacing the bulb that lights a projector is a standard maintenance cost, but they’re also very expensive: A typical 2,000-watt bulb that lasts about 2,000 hours can range from anywhere between $450 to as high as $2,000 for the biggest PLF screens. Brighter, 4,000-watt bulbs, which are used with some PLF screens, might last only 400-500 hours and cost $1,000-$1,300 per bulb. They’re expensive and don’t have a long life. (They use so much energy that projectors also need an exhaust system to cool the light bulb.) As a penny-pinching measure, some theater owners let bulbs run beyond their expiration date. Or, they adjust the power to achieve different lumen levels and create dimmer images.Replacing your screen could be as low as $3,000 if you’re talking an average, 30-foot wide, matte white screen, but it costs as much as $12,000 for a silver screen, which are more common on PLFs and produce a brighter image. The upfront cost of installing an entirely new screen rather than just replacing one can reach up to $40,000-$50,000 for the largest PLF screens.Thanks to “Avatar: The Way of Water,” it could make another comeback. RealD, the main provider of 3-D tech, will provide maintenance and installation as a service in exchange for a small fee from each ticket sold. But if you pay for the equipment yourself to avoid sharing revenue, an installation of a 3-D system is about $13,000, mostly for the hardware that goes on the projector itself in order to filter the image.Many theater chains used the pandemic to upgrade to laser projectors and others are upgrading now. All AMC theaters in Los Angeles facilities were converted last October; the exhibitor targets 2026 for all screens to receive laser upgrades. These machines have more vibrancy, more colors, don’t demand Xenon bulbs or the means to cool them, and they use as much as 70 percent less electricity. Most laser projectors can last for 100,000 hours or 10-15 years, and a 700-watt laser has the equivalent of a 6,000-watt Xenon bulb.The catch, of course, is the cost. According to theater owners, a new laser projector can cost roughly $40,000 for a standard screen, up to $100,000 for a PLF screen, or $150,000 when combining the cost of the projector and lens. Theaters can also lease a projector for anywhere from $700-$1,200 a month, but that may not make sense if an individual screen doesn’t generate that amount in profits.Laser projectors can also mean other significant costs. The projection booth needs to be outside eye level for safety reasons, which means theaters may have to remove seats and fewer tickets to sell. Most theaters may only deal with a seat or two that needs to be removed, but Handren found he had to sacrifice far more.“It was a pause, stop, think it through, make sure I’m not going to make a bad decision,” he said. “I can tell you of a number of times when we went through the analysis and figured out ‘Oh my gosh, we’re going to have to take out a dozen or so seats. There’s only 50 seats to begin with. Wait a minute, we can’t do that.’ It’s not just take one device out and stick another one in. And frankly, the public doesn’t care about that. They want to come in and want to be entertained.”Cinionic, owned by projector provider Barco, has the biggest market share of laser tech around the world. Cinionic CEO Wim Buyens told IndieWire that the company is in conversation with the world’s top 100 exhibitors, with 3,000 laser projectors installed between the roughly 39,000 screens in the U.S. Cinionic also has long-term deals with Regal and Cinemark.Buyens would not comment on costs, but said his company must convince theater owners that better tech drives more attendance. He said theaters can see a return on investment within two to four years, and those installing full new laser projectors may see a lifetime ROI within five to seven years.There’s also the factor of the top of the line Dolby Atmos sound systems. Dolby costs depend on many factors, including the size of the auditorium and the number of speakers required, but one theater owner said his bill for the equipment and install of the system on a PLF screen hit $100,000.One theater owner, who built new, laser-projector auditoriums with standard sound from scratch, said they prefer to look at the costs on a total screen basis. For a standard screen, it amounted to a one-time equipment cost of $200,000 per screen. For a PLF screen, the average is as much as $375,000. (Building and furnishing the room, and installing seats, not included.)PLF theater experiences accounted for a 14 percent share of the North American box office in 2022 according to a recent study from The Cinema Foundation, the nonprofit arm of NATO. The same study said that 39 percent of theater owners (about 20,000 screens across North America) plan to install more PLF screens in the next three years. More than half each plan on upgrading sound and projection equipment in their auditoriums in the same span; 42 percent plan to add recliners.Exhibitors’ trade orgs aren’t paying for these upgrades, but they urge members “to invest in their specific consumers,” TCF president Jackie Brenneman said in a press conference at CinemaCon. “They know their consumers best, and what a consumer in one market might crave, it might be different than what a consumer in another market craves. If an exhibitor has a certain amount of [money] at their disposal, where should they put that money? It depends, but let’s really be curious together.”A studio distributor who spoke on condition of anonymity said exhibitors run into trouble when they don’t have the funds to consistently maintain and update every year. Sometimes, it takes less money to fund attractions inside theaters that have nothing to do with moviegoing. At Cinergy, Benson offers not just theaters but also laser tag, escape rooms, and axe throwing.You may also have heard of motion seat technology 4DX or the wraparound picture known as ScreenX, both of which are offered by 4DPlex, a division of Korean giant CJ. The two formats combined brought in over $100 million of the box office for “Avatar: The Way of Water” last year. Don Savant, the company’s Americas CEO and president, said as many as 1,100 screens worldwide have either 4DX or ScreenX.“We’re getting traction with our audience,” he said. “It’s not something that’s just a gimmick and they see it one time. The biggest pain point is how to drive people out of the home. That’s all we’re talking about in the industry is how we’re driving people into cinemas, because once people get into a cinema, they usually have a pretty good time.”Still, theaters can’t neglect the basics and that’s often what suffers the most. In a panel discussion at CinemaCon, “Scream VI” producer William Sherak said calling a PLF a “premium” experience is problematic: Filmmakers who agonize over getting every detail perfect shouldn’t see quality experiences reserved for something that’s considered a premium.“Every screen should hit the baseline of the experience I’m delivering it in,” he said. “I’ve spent months and millions of dollars, and to walk into a theater where three speakers are out and the lighting is off… the reality is, my 4K television offers that.“To me, that’s a challenge that we have to overcome,” he said. “We spend so much time talking about PLF that we stopped expecting that level of perfection.”",

        "title": "James Gunn Almost Killed Gamora Off in ‘Guardians Vol. 2′:’I Kind of Got Talked Out of It’",
        "content": "One of the more complicated aspects of “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” is that the Gamora (Zoe Saldaña) seen in the film isn’t the Gamora from the first two films in the trilogy; that version died in 2018’s “Avengers: Infinity War,” and in James Gunn’s latest, Saldaña plays a time-displaced version of the character from before the events of the first movie.But that might not have happened had Gunn stuck with his original plan for the second film in the “Guardians” franchise, which would have seen Gamora sacrifice herself to save the team. Gunn revealed this plan to Comic Book.com in a recent interview, saying he was motivated by Saldaña’s openness about not wanting to play the character for an extended length of time.“Gamora almost died in ‘Vol. 2,’” Gunn said. “I knew from the beginning Zoe only wanted to play the character for so many years, and she’s been very honest saying that she’s done [after this]. And so I was going to have her die. I thought she was the one that was going to sacrifice herself.”Ultimately, Gunn changed his mind after speaking to his bosses Kevin Feige and Louis D’Esposito, who urged him to spare Gamora in the film. Instead, Michael Rooker’s Yondu made the final sacrifice, and although Gunn was hesitant because Rooker is his close friend, he felt it worked better for the film’s storyline and themes.“I was kind of talked out of it by Kevin and Louis and then it just didn’t work that well. It didn’t feel right,” Gunn said. “It felt much more right to go where we go in that movie. That seemed what was correct for the story.”Gamora ultimately died in the very next film she appeared in, and Gunn said that “Infinity War’s” directors Joe and Anthony Russo reached out to him for permission before they pulled the plug.“They called me up and said, ‘We’re thinking about this, does this work? Can you work with this?’” Gunn said. “And I went, ‘Got it, yeah. I really can.'”“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” is Gunn’s last film for Marvel, now that the director has moved over to DC Studios as its CEO and director of “Superman: Legacy.” “Guardians Vol. 3” — starring Saldaña, Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, and Sean Gunn — opened May 5 and grossed $114 million domestically in its first weekend.",

        "title": "Judd Apatow: Studios ‘Probably’ Have Plan in Place for Writers’ Strike",
        "content": "Nobody knows how long the current Writers Guild of America strike will last — but Judd Apatow thinks that the studios might have a plan for when they end it.Speaking to Variety at the Rock4EB benefit in Malibu on Saturday, the “Knocked Up” and “Trainwreck” director discussed the WGA‘s work stoppage and the picket lines that have formed at all major studios in Los Angeles and New York after they rejected the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers’ final contract proposal on May 2. Apatow said he thinks studios likely knew the strike was coming, and although they currently haven’t offered to bend on several key points in discussions — including regulation of AI in screenwriting, increased minimum wages, and updated residual models — those in charge likely already know on what issues they’ll concede.“I think they probably already know what they’re going to bend on,” Apatow told Variety. “I would assume they already know what date this is going to end. They’ve probably been planning this for years.”Apatow further explained that he thinks the studios are planning for the strike to wear down union members until they accept a new contract that isn’t as radical and covers less of the union’s demands.“I always think that whatever happens, they could have figured it out already. When these things conclude, you never go, ‘I understand why it took that long.’ It’s never something so inventive and groundbreaking, that you think, ‘Oh, people needed to go to war for months over it.’ It’s always a very obvious position,” Apatow said. “So that’s what’s scary about it, is that there is a solution but I’m not sure that all of the business interests are interested in getting to it quickly.”Apatow currently does not have any projects in production, but told Variety that he had to stop working on projects in development. Still, he said the strike and the WGA’s demands were important, as the current model of limited residuals streamers use does not reward writers and creators for their success, limiting the number of people who are able to afford to pursue screenwriting as a full career.“We have a system now that that does not reward success for a lot of these projects,” Apatow said. “If you make something and a billion people watch it, you don’t make more money than if it was a disaster, right? That’s not good for creativity because it takes away a lot of the motivation for the creative people, because people work really hard to create some sort of cushion for their lives. All of our work is ebb and flow. The successes pay for the time when things aren’t going well. Sometimes they go well and sometimes they don’t, but you can live off of the time that you wrote something that had a lot of residual [fees paid out]. It’s always been a tenuous career. But if you take away most of the linchpins, it’s a career that a majority people can’t survive.”Since the WGA strike began, writing on covered shows across networks and streamers has ceased; late night talk shows have gone dark all together, while series like “Hacks” and “Loot” have ceased filming. AMPTP responded to the strike with a statement expressing disagreement with WGA on several key issues that caused the strike, including mandatory staffing on covered programs.",

        "title": "Paul Schrader Weighs in on AI Writing Debate: WGA ‘Doesn’t Fear’ AI, Fears Not Getting Paid",
        "content": "Since May 2, members of the Writers Guild of America have been on strike in demand of higher minimum wages, overhauled residuals, and various other issues brought up during negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. One particularly contentious issue is the use of artificial intelligence in screenwriting, which WGA leadership has requested be regulated in order to protect writers’ working standards such as compensation, credits, and residuals.Now, filmmaker and elite Facebook poster Paul Schrader is weighing in on the issue. In a post published Thursday, Schrader called the WGA’s position on AI “a fascinating conundrum,” saying he believes it is inevitable that the technology will become a major tool in screenwriting.“The Guild doesn’t fear AI as much as it fears not getting paid. Burrow into that logic. It’s apparent that AI will become a force in film entertainment” Schrader wrote. “Do you need a new episode of ‘CSI: Vegas?’ ChapchatGPT [sic] will deliver that in a matter of seconds. And it will be good, it will cull all the episodes of CSI for the last 20 years and come up with something both generic and contemporary.”Schrader further wrote that he believes writers will become the first users of AI, instead of the studios, using it to write episodes of shows while claiming they wrote it themselves. The director summed up the WGA’s official position on the subject: “If a WGA member employs AI, he/she should be paid as a writer. If a producer uses AI to create a script, they must find a WGA member to pay.”Best known for his scripts to films like “Taxi Driver” and directing movies like “American Gigolo” and “First Reformed,” Schrader has a reputation for weighing in on contentious Hollywood issues via his Facebook posts. Earlier this year, he proclaimed that he would vote for Andrea Riseborough for Best Actress after the late-breaking “To Leslie” campaign was the subject of a contentious Academy investigation; he later admitted he hasn’t watched the Oscars in 10 or 15 years.Aside from his Facebook posts, Schrader also wrote his next film, “Master Gardener.” The film, which stars Joel Edgerton, Sigourney Weaver, and Quintessa Swindell, premiered at the Venice International Film Festival last September to positive reviews and will be released by Magnolia Pictures on May 19.",

        "title": "Richard Dreyfuss Criticizes Oscar Diversity Requirements, Defends Blackface in Laurence Olivier’s ‘Othello’",
        "content": "Richard Dreyfuss is blasting the Oscars‘ looming new inclusivity requirements — and defending the use of blackface in the process.The Oscar-winning “Goodbye Girl” actor sat down for an interview with PBS’ “Firing Line With Margaret Hoover,” released this Friday (via Variety). Although the majority of the interview focused on Dreyfuss’ advocacy for civics education in public schools, he also spoke about the soon to be implemented inclusivity requirements for Best Picture nominees at the Oscars. First announced in 2020 by the Academy after years of criticism against its overwhelmingly white winners and nominees, the rules go into effect in 2025, and only apply to the Best Picture category, with hopefuls needing to achieve certain benchmarks in order to qualify for consideration.These benchmarks aren’t particularly difficult to reach — all films need to meet just two out of four standards in onscreen representation, crew inclusivity, internship opportunities, or marketing representation — but Dreyfuss said they “make me vomit.”“It’s an art. No one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is. What are we risking? Are we really risking hurting people’s feelings? You can’t legislate that,” Dreyfuss told Hoover. “You have to let life be life. I’m sorry, I don’t think there is a minority or majority in the country that has to be catered to like that.”In the interview, Dreyfuss also pushed back against the perception that roles can only be played by actors whose identities align with the character, such as a Jewish character being portrayed by a Jewish actor. Dreyfuss used the extreme example of 1965’s “Othello,” which starred Laurence Olivier as the titular Shakespearean character. Although the film was well received at the time, and Olivier received an Oscar nomination for his performance, it also attracted controversy due to Olivier’s use of heavy blackface to play Othello, a military commander with a “moor” background.“He played a Black man brilliantly. Am I being told that I will never have a chance to play a Black man?,” Dreyfuss said. “Is someone else being told that if they’re not Jewish, they shouldn’t play [in] ‘The Merchant of Venice’? Are we crazy? This is so patronizing. It’s so thoughtless and treating people like children.”In 2017, Dreyfuss was accused of sexual harassment by writer Jessica Teicht, who he worked with on the 1987 ABC Comedy Special “Funny, You Don’t Look 200: A Constitutional Vaudeville.” Teicht alleged that Dreyfuss, who hosted the special, harassed her for months during production and exposed himself to her without consent. Dreyfuss denied exposing himself to her, but admitted that he flirted with Teicht repeatedly and tried to kiss her “as part of what I thought was a consensual seduction ritual that went on and on for many years.”",

        "title": "New ‘Star Wars’ Films Likely Won’t Hit Theaters Until 2025 at Earliest, Kathleen Kennedy Confirms",
        "content": "After a fallow few years in the cinematic space and an uptick in attention to its various TV series, “Star Wars” is finally getting back into the movie business.At last month’s Star Wars Celebration, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy told a rapt crowd that a trio of new features are currently in the works. Those films include new joints from James Mangold (who recently worked with the Lucasfilm crew on this year’s “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” out this summer), long-time “Star Wars” TV guru Dave Filoni, and Oscar-winning filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy’s previously announced feature, which we now know will center on the return of Daisy Ridley’s Rey.But just when can fans expect to see these films? As Kennedy told Empire during an interview at this year’s London event, not until 2025 at the earliest. “It’s much better to tell the truth: that we’re going to make these movies when they’re ready to be made and release them when they’re ready to be released,” she told the outlet.Yet Kennedy and company are already thinking about how the films will be released when the time comes, which will likely include a break between films and a bent toward “eventizing” them for movie-goers. “I’ve often brought up [James] Bond,” she told the outlet. “That’s every three or four years and there wasn’t this pressure to feel like you had to have a movie every year. I feel that was very important to ‘Star Wars.’ We have to eventize this.”Taking a break between films certainly sounds like a good idea, especially after the whiz-bang four-year adventure that was the release pattern for the recent sequel trilogy, but it seems as good a time as any to remind Kennedy that if there’s one thing “Star Wars” films are able to do, it’s be an event, even if that magic has been lacking with recent entries.Kennedy also offered up a few new details on what is likely to be the first film out of the gate, Obaid-Chinoy’s feature, which picks up 15 years after the events of “The Rise of Skywalker.” “What we’re exploring is the evolution of the Jedi,” Kennedy said. “We’re going very far back, we’re looking at the present. […] The First Order has fallen, the Jedi are in chaos — there’s even a question of how many exist anymore — and Rey’s building the New Jedi Order, based on the text that she was given and that Luke imparted on her.”",

        "title": "James Gunn Doesn’t Get ‘Weird Belief’ in Marvel and DC Rivalry: ‘There’s Not Only One Winner’",
        "content": "Few working filmmakers can speak to the inner workings of both Marvel and DC quite like James Gunn, who has just completed his three-film MCU run with this week’s release of his trilogy-capper “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” while also working to rebuild DC Studios alongside longtime producing partner Peter Safran.So, if there’s one guy who gets what it’s like in Marvel Land and DC World, it’s this dude. And he’s not buying that the two superhero-powered studios are all that different.The filmmaker and newly minted studio honcho told Yahoo! Entertainment in a new interview that he doesn’t ascribe to the belief that Marvel and DC are locked in some intense rivalry, or even that they do things in opposing ways. “People have this weird belief that Marvel and DC hate each other or somehow are polar opposites,” he told the outlet. “But it’s just not the truth. I mean, listen, man, our job is the same. We want to get people into the theaters to see movies. That’s what matters.”He added, “And I think that we work together to do that. And the more good Marvel movies are, the better it is for DC movies. The more good DC movies, the better it is for Marvel movies.”And, for those hoping for an explanation in sports terms, Gunn offered that up too, telling the outlet that promoting a Marvel movie while he’s also co-running DC is its own thing, and it’s not as if he’s batting for the Red Sox while also managing the Yankees. “There’s not only one winner,” he said. “There can be two winners because it matters who goes to see your movies and who enjoys ’em.”While Gunn and Safran are still knee-deep in planning out their vision of the DC cinematic universe, Gunn has already personally enjoyed another facet of having two major studios going all-in on superhero stories: the ability to build stories of all kinds within the right cinematic framework.As he told IndieWire in August 2021, when Gunn moved over to Warner Bros. to write and direct one of the studio’s DCEU films after being fired (only to later be re-hired) by Disney, he was understandably looking for a bit of freedom. That included an R rating for “The Suicide Squad,” one of the major stipulations of him even taking on scripting duties for the feature.While the Marvel Cinematic Universe has yet to mount an R-rated entry (“Deadpool” doesn’t count), the DCEU has moved into more adult territory in recent years. Zack Snyder’s “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” arrived in theaters with a PG-13 rating, but an Extended Cut available on home video is rated R. Todd Phillips’ hit “Joker” is rated R, but even Phillips has said it took him a year to convince Warner Bros. to go for it.A Walt Disney Pictures release, “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” is now in theaters.",

        "title": "Emma Thompson Defends Rom-Coms: Genre Is ‘No More Formulaic’ Than Other Films",
        "content": "Emma Thompson is talking some sense and sensibility into the modern romantic comedy debate.The “Sense and Sensibility” and “Love Actually” actress recently called out the assumption that rom-coms hinge on formulaic tropes, comparing the genre to other types of films, such as presumably male-centric action movies.“Romantic comedies are no more formulaic than any other kind of movie. We’re just ruder about them in the same way as what was described even by Jane Austen as ‘stupid female literature,'” Thompson told Variety. “George Eliot said all of these gothic romances that started when women started to write books were absolutely shat upon from a great height by pretty much everybody. But what’s interesting is that the male storytelling, the ‘this is where I save the world,’ it’s just as obvious, just as if not more repetitive.”Thompson continued, “A really good romantic comedy is actually quite hard to come by. And the really good ones are the ones that take their inspiration from people like Jane Austen, who at the same time as, yes, creating a story at the end of which give you the happy ending that clearly she felt was important, but the journey involves a really interesting examination of where society is and where everyone is within that society at the time. So a really good romantic comedy will be multicultural. Absolutely fantastic when it can be that, and also when it can have a really large cast of people.”The “What’s Love Got to Do with It” star added, “So it’s not just about those two romantic people connecting with each other. It draws a really specific world. And I think that’s why this movie’s successful, because you see all sorts of relationships drawn in it. …Even George Eliot, who was one of the greatest intellects of her time, wrote books where two people at the end who want to get married, get married, like Dorothea and Will Ladislaw. And yet, the journey towards it is absolutely fraught, and also fascinating. There is this incredible portrait of human life. It’s just a kind of hook, isn’t it?”Rom-com queen Julia Roberts revealed in 2022 that she had not read a “good” romantic comedy screenplay in 20 years. “People sometimes misconstrue the amount of time that’s gone by that I haven’t done a romantic comedy as my not wanting to do one,” the “Pretty Woman” alum said. “If I had read something that I thought was that ‘Notting Hill’ level of writing or ‘My Best Friend’s Wedding’ level of madcap fun, I would do it.”“How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days” icon Kate Hudson similarly voiced her belief that rom-coms have become “dumbed down” in recent decades. “[They need] an actually good story, let’s start with that,” Hudson said. “I think sometimes people think rom-coms are all about the ‘meet cute.’ A great rom-com is about meeting love, discovering love, falling in love, love falling apart, and then how you come back together. That’s a very traditional rom-com structure. The ones that we love are with two movie stars in a love story. They’re shiny and they’re bright and it’s like wish fulfillment. It’s supposed to make you feel fuzzy, and then they stay with you forever. They’re the most classic. But just because they’re supposed to feel bright doesn’t mean they need to look so bright. A lot of times, again, I think the genre gets kind of dumbed down because they think they know.”",

        "title": "After Oscar Win, Brendan Fraser Is ‘Really Being Picky’ About His Next Move",
        "content": "Oscar season may have wrapped for the calendar year 2022, but Best Actor winner Brendan Fraser is still enjoying the fruits of his recent career labors. On Thursday evening, “The Whale” winner appeared at the Greenwich International Film Festival’s inaugural Inspiration Talk and award ceremony in Stamford, Connecticut where he was honored with the GIFF Inspiration Award “designed to honor artists who inspire others through their craft or philanthropic endeavors.”As People reports, during a wide-ranging chat with broadcast journalist Hannah Storm, Fraser was characteristically open about what’s next. So, post-Oscars win, what does the Canadian actor have on the horizon? “At the moment, I don’t have anything — I’m really being picky right now,” Fraser said.After a grueling (and often emotional) Oscar season spent stumping for Darren Aronofsky’s heart-wrenching drama and speaking candidly about his own personal connection to the material, Fraser has certainly earned a little respite.But Fraser does have one film coming up soon, a little something called Martin Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon,” which will premiere at the Cannes Film Festival later this month, before being released in select theaters on October 6 with a wide release on October 20. It will stream on Apple TV+ after that theatrical run.“I will tell you that I’m excited to see it myself,” Fraser said of the new film. “We were working in really hot weather in Oklahoma, and I can’t oversell my participation in this film because it’s epic. There’s so many actors in this movie when you see it. I’ll arrive for a scene or two at the end.”The film also stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, Lily Gladstone, Jesse Plemons, Scott Shepherd, Pat Healy, Tantoo Cardinal, Cara Jade Myers, JaNae Collins, Jillian Dion, William Belleau, Louis Cancelmi, Tatanka Means, Michael Abbott Jr., Gary Basaraba, and Grammy Award-winning musicians Jason Isbell and Sturgill Simpson.Of working with Scorsese, even in a small role, Fraser was effusive. “It’s like my fantasies fulfilled at what it’s like to be in a Renaissance master’s studio,” he said. “Think about that. Somebody who has all the knowledge, hands down and surrounded by people who are so talented and enthusiastic for his vision. … The work that we did was kind of being in an opera or a play because it was happening in real time.”“Killers” is Scorsese’s follow-up to his 10-time Oscar nominee “The Irishman” and his first collaboration with Apple Films. The film brings the lauded director into the Western genre for the first time and reunites him with some of his most prolific actors and crafts collaborators (yes, of course, Thelma Schoonmaker is editing).

        "title": "The Hidden Link Between the WGA Strike and This Year’s Cannes Film Festival (Column)",
        "content": "Wes Anderson and Martin Scorsese are in a pickle at this year’s Cannes Film Festival. The directors of “Killers of the Flower Moon” and “Asteroid City” have contractual obligations to promote their movies; however, both are WGA members with writing credits on their latest work, and the WGA’s strike regulations prohibit members from promoting new projects. Neither the WGA nor the DGA responded when I asked for clarification on these competing policies, though I’m told the DGA is leaving this one up to the writers, while sources working on both movies say they’re assuming the filmmakers will be cleared to do their work because, quite simply, the writer-director has a different role than screenwriting on its own: They’re auteurs. Therein lies the rub. The confluence of Cannes and the writers strike illuminates a key factor in the latest work stoppage that differentiates it from the ones that came before. Cannes is the ultimate auteur festival — and at stake on both sides of the WGA negotiation is the future of authorship itself. This applies to the biggest subjects of contention. Writers want longer TV contracts and a minimum number of writers on every show, which the AMPTP has said interferes with the creative process; writers also want sole writing credit on AI-generated ideas, a demand that runs counter to the way studios view their own approach to IP. I recently suggested that the WGA should tweak its demand on this, so that writers are guaranteed a role in any generative AI responsible for original ideas. Yet even if that were the outcome, it would mark a shift in the singular nature of the creative process. Hollywood may not want to obliterate all sense of authorship behind its work, but its current trajectory will make the prospects of individualized creativity more rarified than ever. Anderson and Scorsese are among the handful of Americans with projects at this year’s biggest festival who will be forced to reckon with these questions unfolding back home. (Anderson may prefer Paris, but even expats can’t escape the responsibilities associated with accepting studio paychecks.) They’re joined by Todd Haynes, who does not have a screenwriting credit on buzzy Cannes acquisition title “May December,” but with the DGA beginning its own studio negotiations on May 10 — five days before Cannes, for a contract that expires at the end of June — directors won’t be immune from major questions about the state of their profession within the industry. And these A-listers need to start talking about it. So far, the discourse surrounding the WGA strike has been a siloed affair mostly relegated to the challenges facing freelance writers in the gig economy. That’s an important focus for so much of the writing community as countless scribes battle to make ends meet, but it’s not the only the major issue at hand. If studios and creatives can’t come to terms with new standards in this fight, it will make it impossible for the concept of directorial originality to survive in America. As a country with close to zero governmental subsidies for the arts, the U.S. is ill-equipped to foster authentic new voices; as I suggested in this column last year, more American directors should consider working on international co-productions simply to get their projects off the ground. However, even as studios don’t value originality over IP storytelling, they rely on original voices to endow their greatest undertakings with the substance necessary to make them worth the investment. That’s why “Star Wars” has employed everyone from David Lowery to the Daniels on recent shows, why Lorene Scafaria directs “Succession,” and the MCU taps festival favorites. I remain dubious about the value of these paychecks for talented filmmakers, but there’s no denying the corporate strategy in play: You buy your authenticity by hiring people who bring it to the table from the start.The WGA negotiations — and the DGA ones that follow — exist to ensure a safeguard remains in place for that authenticity to function within a system that feeds on it. It’s a battle to ensure that writers can develop their talent and continue to be a part of the industry as it evolves. Writers need a deal that lets them take part in the changing nature of the machine. Contrary to the doom-and-gloom prognostication I’ve seen in recent weeks, AI doesn’t strike me as a technological force intent on supplanting artistry; it just calls for a new set of skills. Polish off your prompts, people.This year’s Cannes competition lineup is loaded with old-school auteurs who wouldn’t look out of place in the lineup 20 years ago: Catherine Breillat, Ken Loach, Wim Wenders, oh my! Many of these movies hold promise, at least for cinephiles invested in the work of singular directors who maintain their creative fixations.But with only one first-time filmmaker in competition — the Senegalese “Banel and Adama,” of which I hear promising things — the section doesn’t offer much indication about whether future generations can follow suit. If the system makes the entire creative process unsustainable, the trickle-down effect for the art of filmmaking could result in irrevocable damage to the profession. The WGA may have its picket lines covered in New York and Los Angeles, but it wouldn’t hurt to get one rolling on the Croisette, too. As usual, I welcome feedback to this weekly column: eric@indiewire.comBrowse previous installments here. ",

        "title": "Marvel’s ‘Blade’ Delayed by Writers Strike",
        "content": "Marvel Studios is pushing pause on its vampire superhero movie “Blade” starring Mahershala Ali, making it the first major tentpole film to be impacted by the writers strike, an individual with knowledge of the production confirmed to IndieWire.The film was meant to begin shooting next month in Atlanta and was in pre-production. Cast and crew members were notified of the shutdown on Friday afternoon, and production will not be able to resume until whenever the strike ends.This is the second delay for “Blade,” which was originally scheduled to release in theaters this November before getting pushed to September 2024. Last September, original director Bassam Tariq exited the project two months before production was initially scheduled to begin. Yann Demange was hired in November, and the studio added new talent to the project earlier this month, including Mia Goth in the cast and “True Detective” creator Nic Pizzolatto, who is writing a new draft of the script by Michael Starrbury.While “Blade” confirms its status as the unluckiest Marvel Studios production around, several other Marvel productions are expected to start or continue production during the strike. One film and two shows — “Captain America: New World Order,” “Agatha: Coven of Chaos,” and “Wonder Man” — are currently filming, while “Deadpool 3” and “Thunderbolts” are still going ahead with production later this month and in June, respectively.Other big blockbusters generally have their scripts evolve during production, but Marvel plans out release dates well in advance and often is writing on the go, which could pose challenges if the writers strike drags on. Marvel is currently casting “Fantastic Four” and is scheduled to begin filming in January 2024 in London.It’s also against the strike rules for WGA members who are also “hyphenates,” or dual members of the WGA and another guild, to do any writing work on a project even when they’re working in a separate capacity. That includes what’s commonly known as “(a) through (h)” services, or a variety of work — such as cutting scenes or small changes to dialogue during production — that non-writers can perform on WGA-covered shows, according to the union’s contract. Disney and HBO earlier this week sent a letter to its showrunners reminding them of their responsibilities, which poses a dilemma for some hyphenates.The 2023 Writers Strike began on Tuesday after the guild and the AMPTP failed to reach a deal on a new minimum bargaining agreement, and the two sides are very far apart, suggesting things could drag out for a while. Late night shows have gone dark, and numerous other TV shows have already seen their writers rooms paused.THR first reported the news.",

        "title": "Disney and Other Studios Demand Showrunners Continue to Work During WGA Strike",
        "content": "Much of Hollywood has come to a standstill since the WGA strike kicked off this week, but Disney and some other studios are putting pressure on their talent to cross the picket line. Earlier this week, the company sent out a letter to showrunners and other TV writers with other contracted non-writing duties, pushing them to continue working during the strike. Other studios have also sent similar communications, as sources revealed to IndieWire.A letter sent to showrunners from Disney’s ABC Signature on Wednesday was obtained by the Hollywood Reporter. The letter, signed by ABC assistant chief counsel Bob McPhail, says that showrunners and writer-producers are “not excused” from performing their non-writing duties amid the WGA strike, and that their personal service agreement requires them to keep working even in the event of the Writers Guild fining them for doing so.“Your duties as a showrunner and/or producer are not excused, suspended or terminated until and unless you are so notified in writing by the Studio,” the letter reads. “Studio intends to stay in production during the WGA strike and we are legally entitled to do so.”A person with knowledge of the situation confirmed the authenticity of the ABC Signature letter to IndieWire. HBO and HBO Max have sent a similar letter obtained by IndieWire to its writers who have additional duties on series. “If you are a non-writing Producer and not a member of the WGA, the WGA does not and cannot prohibit you from working,” the HBO/HBO Max letter states.CBS sent what a third source called “an informational letter” to showrunners and supervisory producers. The letter noted that under the National Labor Relations Act, those producers are still “allowed” to perform non-writing supervisory producer functions, which is exactly what the studio expects.Another source at a fourth studio told IndieWire this is not a coordinated effort by all studios, and that their studio has not sent out such a letter to its showrunners. This source, who asked to remain anonymous, acknowledged the fluidity of the situation and that such a letter could at some point come from their studio.IndieWire has reached out to the Writers Guild, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, and studios/platforms including Amazon, Paramount, Netflix, Amazon, Warner Bros., Lionsgate (who declined to comment), Universal, and Apple for comment.The letter obtained by THR features a “Q&A” section outlining showrunners and writers’ “rights” during the work stoppage, including that they are federally allowed to work regardless of the strike. The Q&A states showrunners are “required” to perform non-writing services regardless of the strike, including post-production work and “(a) through (h)” services, or a variety of work — such as cutting scenes or small changes to dialogue during production — that non-writers can perform on WGA-covered shows, according to the union’s contract.Under the strike rules outlined by the WGA, union members are prohibited from performing these services during a work stoppage: “The Rules prohibit hyphenates (members who are employed in dual capacities) from performing any writing services, including the ‘(a) through (h)’ functions.” This means that showrunners who perform these functions during the stoppage would be subject to fines or disciplinary action from WGA leadership.Disney’s letter marks the latest response from studios pushing back on the WGA strike, which began after the union rejected the final contract proposal from the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). Striking TV writers have formed picket lines at major studios around Los Angeles and New York, protesting over issues that include regulation of AI in writing, increased minimum wages, an overhauled residual system, and transparency regarding streaming viewership.On Thursday, the AMPTP released a statement disputing many of the WGA’s demands, saying that the union misrepresented its offers for minimum wage and healthcare, and pushed back on certain demands, including mandatory staff rooms for scripted series. Studio heads have also minimized concerns about how the strike would affect their business, such as Paramount CEO Bob Bakish, who claimed “consumers really won’t notice anything for a while.”",

        "content": "Mohammad Rasoulof‘s invitation to Cannes has ignited a campaign to allow the Iranian filmmaker to leave his home nation.International Coalition for Filmmakers at Risk (ICFR), an Amsterdam-based organization, issued a statement titled “Let Mohammad Rasoulof Go!” urging the Iranian government to allow the filmmaker to travel to France for this year’s Cannes Film Festival. The “There Is No Evil” filmmaker was invited to serve on the Un Certain Regard jury but is unable to attend due to Iran’s travel embargo on him.Rasoulof was recently banned from leaving Iran after being arrested in July 2022 for posting statements criticizing government-sanctioned violence against protesters. Rasoulof was later temporarily released in February 2023 due to ongoing health concerns. He was later pardoned and sentenced to one year of penal servitude and a two-year ban from leaving Iran on the charge of “propaganda against the regime.”Similarly, director Jafar Panahi, who was detained alongside Rasoulof, was released from prison in March 2023 following a hunger strike. Panahi has since been able to travel outside of Iran for the first time in 14 years, flying to France earlier this year and returning to Iran.“Both have repeatedly been in conflict with Iranian authorities, had their passports confiscated and been jailed. Now one can travel, the other not,” the ICFR statement reads, citing the comparative treatment between Rasoulof and Panahi (via Deadline). “ICFR calls on the Iranian authorities to drop the travel ban against Mohammad Rasoulof and we encourage all film and culture institutions around the world to do the same.”The ICFR is a joint initiative between IDFA, the European Film Academy (EFA), and the International Film Festival Rotterdam (IFFR) to support filmmakers facing persecution. The organization was founded following the protest to release Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov amid the Russian invasion.The 2023 Cannes Un Certain Regard jury sans Rasoulof will be overseen by jury president John C. Reilly, who is joined by French director and screenwriter Alice Winocour, German actress Paula Beer, Franco-Cambodian director and producer Davy Chou, and Belgian actress Émilie Dequenne.",

        "title": "The 7 Best New Movies to Netflix in May 2023",
        "content": "Summer is just around the corner, so nobody would blame you if you want to spend less time watching Netflix and more time outside this month — but then again, we haven’t quite hit the heart of the summer movie season, so you might need a new slate of classic films to tide you over until then. Fortunately, Netflix’s latest slate of additions to its film library is enough to keep any cinephile satisfied for quite some time.Mother’s Day is just a couple of weeks away, but Netflix has gone all in on “dad cinema” with some of its new inclusions.  It’s a big month for war movies, with both the misunderstood anti-war satire “Starship Troopers” and the considerably less anti-war “Black Hawk Down” both hitting the streaming service this month. Fans of Ridley Scott will have plenty to feast on, as his Denzel Washington-led “American Gangster” is also joining the Netflix library. There are also some excellent crime flicks from the likes of Stephen Soderbergh (“Traffic”) and Luc Besson (“Léon: The Professional”) that are now available on the streamer.But per usual, there’s a little something for everyone this month. Wildly divergent classics “American Graffiti” and “This Is the End” round out the highlights of this month’s new Netflix offerings. If you’re not headed out to the multiplexes to see “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” this weekend, Netflix has you covered with an embarrassment of riches to watch at home. Keep reading for seven of our picks.Luc Besson is a messy filmmaker, and his boundless creativity has paved the way for some real duds in his filmography. But when he hits, he absolutely nails it — and “Léon: The Professional” remains the best example of his distinct style. Anchored by standout performances by frequent collaborator Jean Reno as the eponymous hitman and a young Natalie Portman as his far-too-young apprentice, the stylish film blends violence and sentimentality in a way that only Besson can.Steven Soderbergh’s filmography is arguably more interesting for the endless hidden gems it contains than his biggest hits — but “Traffic,” his consensus critical high point, is still pretty great. Soderbergh won his first (and to date, only) Oscar for directing this sprawling ensemble piece about various fictional characters impacted by America’s War on Drugs in different ways. As a political statement, it’s clearly a product of its time, but the humanity captured by Soderbergh and his A-list cast ensures that it will always be a captivating watch. Like so many Paul Verhoeven movies, “Starship Troopers” was criminally misunderstood when it hit theaters in 1997. The adaptation of Robert Heinlein’s landmark novel was always designed as a satire of war-hungry politicians and the military-industrial complex that enjoys a symbiotic relationship with them, but many audiences mistook its deliberately campy propaganda as a failed attempt at crafting genuine sci-fi thrills. Fortunately, we’re finally catching up to where Verehoven already was 25 years ago, so it’s a great time to revisit the film. One of those “this worked infinitely better than it should have” movies, “This Is the End” sees Seth Rogen and an ensemble of his famous friends playing themselves in this comedy about celebrities responding to a fictional apocalypse. Like eating pufferfish at a sushi bar, meta-comedy is a genre that quickly turns disastrous in the hands of anyone but an expert. But Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Emma Watson, and the rest of the cast thread a perfect needle by playing against type and having a great time while doing so. Though George Lucas spent the better part of the last half-century focusing on his “Star Wars” and “Indiana Jones” franchise, his early works prove that he had the filmmaking chops to work in any genre he wanted. “American Graffiti,” his nostalgic account of his 1950s California adolescence, remains a stellar slice-of-life comedy with a killer soundtrack. It also marked the first time that Lucas worked with Harrison Ford, which seems pretty important in hindsight. Ridley Scott and Denzel Washington teamed up to riff on the “Scarface” formula in this fictionalized account of heroin mogul Frank Lucas’ life. While they take plenty of creative liberty with the actual story, a stellar cast including Russell Crowe and Chiwetel Ejiofor and Scott’s clear understanding of the gangster genre make for a pulpy good time. “American Gangster” is basically an example of a bunch of elite artists trying their hand at the “movies your dad enjoys rewatching on a Sunday afternoon” genre, so it’s a perfect fit for Netflix. If “American Gangster” didn’t scratch your itch for Ridley Scott fare, his military classic “Black Hawk Down” is also hitting Netflix this month. The film tells the story of a disastrously botched helicopter raid at Mogadishu during the Somali Civil War and the hell that the American soldiers endured when the chopper crashed in enemy territory. The Jerry Bruckheimer-produced movie is more notable for its jaw-dropping spectacle and meticulous recreations of war than for any incisive commentary, but it remains a marvelous filmmaking achievement.

        "content": "Bel Powley is sharing her story of on-set abuse.The “Morning Show” star spoke to The Independent about how a senior crew member inappropriately touched her during a past production when Powley was in her early 20s.“I’ve had someone grab my arse and basically touch me inappropriately before,” Powley told the outlet as part of an interview to be published Saturday, May 6. “I was too scared to say anything. I was too scared to rock the boat.”Powley, who currently stars in Disney+ series “A Small Light,” continued, “I just avoided that person and it was fine, but what really has changed post-MeToo is you just know that you’re protected. At the beginning of MeToo it was weird. For a while it was like, I feel protected because men are just fucking scared, which was fine too, but now everything’s settled into itself. People have learned and it’s like there’s a new code of conduct.”The “Everything I Know About Love” alum also addressed how former indie films approached sex scenes in which she was “too scared to say no” despite sequences not being outlined in her contract.“I did have a couple of bad ones where everyone’s too awkward to ask if you’re going to take your clothes off, and you don’t have it written up properly in the contract,” Powley said, without naming the past features. “It’s low-budget, indie, guerilla-style filming. You’re outside and suddenly it’s the scene where you have to get naked and simulate sex, and then you just find yourself doing it because you’re too scared to say no, with a young actor who probably felt just as uncomfortable.”Powley specifically applauded the production of 2015 film “The Diary of a Teenage Girl” for being a better experience than other indies when filming intimate scenes.Powley previously told IndieWire’s Kate Erbland that “The Diary of a Teenage Girl” set out to change how female teenage sexuality is depicted onscreen. “I think that body image in the media is so negative for young women at the moment,” Powley said. “It can be so damaging to people. It takes young women a long time to learn to love themselves.”She added of the onscreen sex scenes, “This may sound like a complete cliche, but I’m honestly so proud of it. I mean specifically about, let’s just say it, the nudity and the nakedness. I wish I’d seen a normal body like this onscreen in such a brilliant film about female sexuality when I was a teenager.”",

        "content": "The 2023 Cannes Film Festival will pay tribute to late auteur Jean-Luc Godard with a special screening of “Drôles de Guerres (Phoney Wars)” as a highlight of the program.Godard died at age 91 in September 2022, and this year’s Cannes will screen “Contempt” and documentary “Godard by Godard” to commemorate the filmmaker as part of the Cannes Classics lineup. Godard’s final project is a 20-minute trailer for “Drôles de Guerres (Phoney Wars),” a film he never finished.“Jean-Luc Godard often transformed his synopses into aesthetic programs,” an official Cannes statement read. “‘Phoney Wars’ follows in this tradition and will remain as the ultimate gesture of cinema.”The description of “Phoney Wars” reads: “To no longer trust the billions of diktats of the alphabet to give back freedom to the incessant metamorphoses and metaphors of a true language by returning to the places of past shoots while taking into account the present stories.”Godard was awarded a special Palme d’Or in 2018 for “The Image Book,” with then-jury president Cate Blanchett honoring the film.The trailer is billed as a Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello and Vixens production, in coproduction with L’Atelier. Filmmaker Fabrice Aragno, Godard’s longtime collaborator, will be in attendance for the special screening.The Saint Laurent fashion house film productions additionally include Pedro Almodóvar’s “Strange Way of Life” which is also debuting at Cannes. Feature-length films by David Cronenberg and Paolo Sorrentino are additionally in the works.The Cannes Classics lineup this year is rounded out by a restored version of Man Ray’s “Return to Reason” with a new score by Jim Jarmusch’s band Sqürl; Lubna Playoust’s documentary “Room 999” revisiting Wim Wenders’ “Room 666;” and a tribute screening of documentary “Liv Ullman – A Road Less Travelled.” A celebration of Yasujirō Ozu in honor of the 70th anniversary of his death features restorations of “Record of a Tenement Gentleman” and “The Munekata Sisters.”For the full Cannes lineup, click here.",

        "content": "Michael Shannon is addressing his “The Flash” co-star Ezra Miller‘s ongoing allegations.The actor, who reprises his role of villain Zod in the upcoming multiverse DC film, shared what it was like working with Miller, who has multiple assault accusations and arrests. Miller, who identifies as non-binary and uses they/them pronouns, was at the center of felony charges and allegations of grooming minors leading up to “The Flash” DCEU tentpole release. The actor has since issued a statement pledging their dedication to mental health treatment.“I thought Ezra was lovely — very kind to me when I was there,” Shannon told Vanity Fair. “It’s difficult to talk about, but I always give people a lot of slack in this business, because there’s a lot of people in this business that have issues. And some people have more privacy than others.”Shannon added, “Any time somebody is out in the spotlight getting picked on, I feel for them. Even if it’s warranted, it’s still a horrible situation.”First reactions to “The Flash” have touted the film as a key installment to the changing the DCEU under new co-CEOs James Gunn and Peter Safran, as well as Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav. The comic book banner has stood by Miller amid their allegations.“Ezra is completely committed to their recovery, and we are fully supportive of that journey that they’re on right now,” Safran said during the 2023 DC presentation. “When the time is right, when they feel like they’re ready to have the discussion, we’ll all figure out what the best path forward is. Right now, they are completely focused on their recovery. In our conversations with them over the last couple of months, it feels like they’re making enormous progress.”DC Studios co-head Gunn added, “I also feel like it’s important to point out, thousands of people worked on ‘The Flash,’ and these people dedicated the last few years of their lives to making something really special. Andy Muschietti, the director, Barbara Muschietti, the producer, Christina [Hodson], the writer, Michael Keaton, all of the other people, all of these other people, and to start making it as if a movie is one person that depends on this one person is something that can be frustrating as a filmmaker, especially as a director who knows that often times an actor spends three months of his life on a set and a director spends two years creating it.”Miller issued a statement in 2022 opening up about enduring a “time of intense crisis” that encompassed years worth of erratic behavior, allegations of child abuse and running a cult, as well as choking a woman in Iceland.“Having recently gone through a time of intense crisis, I now understand that I am suffering complex mental health issues and have begun ongoing treatment,” Miller wrote. “I want to apologize to everyone that I have alarmed and upset with my past behavior. I am committed to doing the necessary work to get back to a healthy, safe and productive stage in my life.”",

        "content": "It’s Béla Tarr season this year, as not only is the Hungarian filmmaking making a rare appearance in the United States for a Los Angeles American Cinematheque retrospective of his work, but Janus Films is also re-releasing his 2000 masterpiece “Werckmeister Harmonies.”Per distributor Janus Films, one of the major achievements of 21st-century cinema, Béla Tarr’s mesmeric parable of societal collapse is an enigma of transcendent visual, philosophical, and mystical resonance. Adapted from a novel by the celebrated writer and frequent Tarr collaborator László Krasznahorkai, “Werckmeister Harmonies” unfolds in an unknown era in an unnamed village, where, one day, a mysterious circus — complete with an enormous stuffed whale and a shadowy, demagogue-like figure known as the Prince — arrives and appears to awaken a kind of madness in the citizens, which builds inexorably toward violence and destruction. In 39 of his signature long takes, engraved in ghostly black and white, Tarr conjures an apocalyptic vision of dreamlike dread and fathomless beauty.“Werckmeister Harmonies” opens Friday, May 26 at Film at Lincoln Center with other venues to follow. Meanwhile, the Cinematheque programming in the U.S. features screenings of “The Man from London,” “Damnation,” “Family Nest,” “The Outsider,” all gloriously bleak seven hours of “Sátántangó,” and his most recent feature, 2011’s “The Turin Horse.”IndieWire spoke with the director, who famously plumbs the nadirs of human experience in all his films, in 2019. When asked why his movies continue to resonate outside of Europe, he said, “I’m not prophetic. I was just an ugly, poor filmmaker. I still am. I don’t have power. I don’t have anything — just a fucking camera.”“Hi LA! It will be nice to see you again, after a very long time. I am curious how you are now and what is going on in the town! I hope we will have a good meeting and we will spend a good time together. See you there!” the filmmaker said in a statement to IndieWire regarding his upcoming visit to Los Angeles.Below, IndieWire shares the exclusive trailer for the 4K Janus Films restoration of “Werckmeister Harmonies.”",

        "content": "Andrew Garfield and Daisy Edgar-Jones are bringing a true romance to life.The Oscar nominee and “Where the Crawdads Sing” actress are set to lead Academy Award winner Sebastián Lelio’s “Voyagers” based on the real-life relationship between astronomer Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan, who produces the feature. FilmNation Entertainment is set to launch global sales at 2023 Cannes. Ben Browning produces for FilmNation Entertainment, along with Lynda Obst.“Voyagers” takes place in 1977 as NASA prepares to launch humanity’s first interstellar probes, a team led by Sagan set out to create a message to accompany them — The Golden Record. But what starts out as a race-against-the-clock mission becomes an epic, unexpected love story between Carl and his collaborator Ann Druyan. FilmNation Entertianment paired Druyan with screenwriters Lelio and Jessica Goldberg who wrote the original screenplay based on interviews with Druyan and many others who worked on the Golden Record project, per a press release.“As a nine-year-old boy growing up during Chile’s dictatorship, Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan’s TV series ‘Cosmos’ had a profound impact on me, igniting my fascination with life’s biggest questions and mysteries,” writer-director Lelio said. “It is a dream to make a movie about the Golden Record and, within it, the inspiring love story between Carl and Ann. I’m thrilled that Andrew Garfield and Daisy Edgar-Jones will be at the center of this epic romance set against the infinite backdrop of space and time.”Emmy and Peabody-winning producer Druyan, whose story is at the center of the film, added, “Imagine falling madly, truly in love with one of the greatest humans who ever lived, while creating a complex message about what it is to be alive, a golden record affixed to the first interstellar spacecraft launched by our species, bound to sail the Milky Way galaxy long after Earth ceases to exist. It takes a movie to bring that mythic experience, that cosmic love story to vivid life. After years of searching, I feel that we have found exactly the right colleagues and artists to capture the magic of it.”Producer Obst shared, “I’m thrilled that this cosmic yet intimate love story that I had the honor to witness is being brought to life by such an exquisite team of Sebastián Lelio, Jessica Goldberg, Andrew Garfield, and Daisy Edgar-Jones.”Lelio co-wrote and directed “The Wonder” starring Florence Pugh, which was nominated for Outstanding British Film of the Year at last year’s BAFTA. “Voyagers” lead star Garfield is currently in production on another Pugh project with John Crowley’s “We Live in Time.” Garfield and Edgar-Jones recently collaborated on FX true crime series “Under the Banner of Heaven” for which Garfield was nominated for an Emmy.

        "content": "After prolonged negotiations for fair pay, the WGA went on strike, and Hollywood was forced to rethink how it relates to the economics of writing for film and TV. That was 2008. The strike lasted for 100 days.Well, here we go again. After extensive conversations with the AMPTP, the WGA once again went on strike this week, and nobody knows how long it will take this time. One thing is certain, though: a lot has changed about the market for writers in the streaming era, and it only stands to change more now that AI is on the scene.In this week’s episode of Screen Talk, Eric Kohn and Anne Thompson discuss those extensive changes and how much of the WGA’s current demands stand a real shot at getting through. They also look at the potential impact on current and future productions.Also in this week’s episode, the pair look at the recent changes announced on Monday by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, including new rules for campaigning designed to curb another Andrea Riseborough problem and a surprise update to the requirements for Best International Feature Film.Watch the full episode above or listen to it below.Screen Talk is produced by Azwan Badruzaman and available on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, and Spotify, and hosted by Megaphone.

        "title": "Strike? What Strike? Analysts Skip WGA Questions on Warner Bros. Discovery Earnings Call",
        "content": "Warner Bros. Discovery chief David Zaslav did not address the WGA writers strike on Friday’s Q1 earnings call. He didn’t have to — nobody asked.WBD’s first-quarter 2023 earnings came out Friday at 7 a.m. ET; the conference call kicked off an hour later. Zaslav and his CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels did not address the Writers Guild of America boycott in their prepared remarks, which spanned the first half of the hour-long call. And then in the second half, no media analysts asked them (or streaming boss JB Perrette, also on the call) about it. That probably resulted in a pretty satisfying 9 a.m. ET shrug from the company’s senior executives; they were definitely prepared for the expected query, we hear.So why did no one step up to the plate? One equity analyst told IndieWire that institutional investors are just not that as interested in the topic as the press — at least, not yet. That’s fair. The media, especially the entertainment media (including us), cannot get enough. But the strike is not immediately material to a company with the diversity of content of WBD. By the end of summer, that may be a different story, our source said.Zaslav did take a few moments to root on his New York Knicks in their ongoing NBA Playoffs series with the Miami Heat. He’ll be at Game 5 Wednesday at New York City’s Madison Square Garden, he said.Not every chief executive is getting off so easy. A day earlier, Paramount Global President and CEO Bob Bakish had a brief prepared statement about the strike at the top of his earnings call; he was also asked to expand upon the topic early on in the Q&A with analysts. (Many of the same ones were on the Warner Bros. Discovery call.) There’s a key difference here between Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery, however: WBD does not have a broadcast network, Paramount has CBS. We’re currently at the tail-end of pilot season ahead of the mid-month upfronts, when TV networks reveal their new schedules. But without writers to pen scripts ahead of summer production, broadcast-TV especially can’t really schedule anything new for fall or — or even for midseason, really.So that explains some of the thought process of WBD analysts, who favored queries about cash, sports, and Max, among other topics. Still, even Adam Aron, chief of AMC Theatres, was asked about the writers strike on his own Friday morning earnings call. So was Cinemark CEO Sean Gamble.The famously well-compensated Zaslav has been a topic of ire at the picket lines. WGA members wants what they believe to be a modest pay bump for underpaid film and TV writers; Zaslav, like many top executives, has no money problems to speak of. According to a March 29 proxy filing with the SEC, in 2022 Zaslav recognized nearly $247 million in total pay. Most of that came from options that needed to be accounted for due to the WarnerMedia-Discovery merger. His 2022 pay was nearly $40 million, more than half of which came from bonuses. Zaslav’s actual salary is now a bit north of $3 million.Read Warner Bros. Discovery’s Q1 earnings here. While the numbers weren’t great, there is promise from streaming: Zaslav said he now expects the direct-to-consumer business to be profitable this year. Previous guidance pegged 2024 as the year streaming, Max (soon to be rebranded from HBO Max) and Discovery+, would first turn a profit.The writers guild has been picketing studios since Tuesday, after the deadline passed for a new deal between the parties. At odds include a lack of streaming residuals, and the impact shorter orders — and tighter writing windows — for digital programs have had on writers’ pay.",

        "content": "We’ve got good news and bad news for Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders. While the company lost another $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2023 on a (non-adjusted) net basis, its U.S. streaming portfolio actually made money ($50 million) before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. And David Zaslav, the president and CEO, now believes the direct-to-consumer business will turn a profit for this year — the previous expectation was that would not happen until next year.Netflix and Hulu are the only streamers that are profitable; Disney believes Disney+ will turn a profit in 2024. Paramount+ and Peacock are anyone’s guesses at this point.Wall Street projected WBD would earn a penny per share in Q1 on revenue of $10.78 billion. While Warner Bros. Discovery very slightly missed on revenue with $10.700 billion, it whiffed on earnings with a loss of 44 cents per share. Adjusted EBITDA, again, those earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, was $2.6 billion.The company’s previous quarterly losses were: $2.1 billion (Q4 2022), $2.3 billion (Q3), $3.4 billion (Q2). WarnerMedia and Discovery, Inc. came together to form the new company in April 2022.Warner Bros. Discovery had negative free cash flow (-$930 million) in Q1 one due to sports rights and other cyclic payments. The company ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of cash on hand and $49.5 billion in gross debt.HBO Max and Discovery+ added 1.6 million combined subscribers in Q1, which will ultimately be the final full quarter for HBO Max; the new tally is 97.6 million. The two streamers will be combined into one service, Max, on May 23, though Discovery+ will continue to be made available as a standalone streaming platform. Last quarter, HBO Max and Discovery+ added 1.1 million combined subs.Warner Bros. feature films in the first quarter of ’23 included “Magic Mike’s Last Dance,” “Creed III” (international markets only), “Shazam 2,” and “Evil Dead Rise.” The big one, “The Flash,” comes out in June; we were treated to a full screening last week at CinemaCon. Not to be outdone in the opening quarter, HBO Max saw the premieres for “The Last of Us” in January; the final season of “Succession” debuted on HBO in March.“It is an important time for Warner Bros. Discovery. We’ve come through some major restructurings and have repositioned our businesses with greater precision and focus. And we see a number of positive proof points emerging, with DTC perhaps the most prominent,” David Zaslav, president and CEO, said in a statement on Friday. “We made a meaningful turn this quarter with $50 million in segment EBITDA and 1.6 million net adds, and we feel great about the trajectory we are on. In fact, we now expect our U.S. DTC business to be profitable for 2023 – a year ahead of our guidance. Even in today’s challenging marketplace, we are positioned to drive free cash flow and deleverage our balance sheet, and we remain confident in our strategy and ability to achieve our financial targets.”Zaslav and his senior management team will hold a conference call at 8 a.m. ET to discuss the quarterly results in greater detail.Max will launch at the current HBO Max prices: $15.99 per month (or $149.99/year) for ad-free and $9.99 per month (or $99.99/year) with ads. There’s also a new “Ultimate” ad-free plan for $19.99 per month (or $199.99/year) that allows four concurrent streams, 4K resolution, 100 offline downloads, and Dolby Atmos sound. Discovery+ costs $4.99 per month with ads of $6.99 without.",

        "title": "Cillian Murphy Was ‘Desperate to Play a Lead’ for Christopher Nolan in ‘Oppenheimer’",
        "content": "It was only a matter of time until Cillian Murphy stepped into a leading role for Christopher Nolan.After first meeting 20 years ago for a “Batman Begins” screen test, Murphy has collaborated on multiple films with director Nolan, ranging from the “Dark Knight” trilogy to “Inception” and “Dunkirk,” which to date is one of the performances Murphy is “really proud of.” Now, Murphy is at the center of star-studded ensemble period piece “Oppenheimer” about the scientist who invented the atomic bomb.“He’s so understated and self-deprecating and, in his very English manner, just said, ‘Listen, I’ve written this script, it’s about Oppenheimer. I’d like you to be my Oppenheimer.’ It was a great day,” Murphy told the Associated Press of how Nolan cast him in the eponymous role back in September 2020. “We have this long-standing understanding and trust and shorthand and respect. It felt like the right time to take on a bigger responsibility. And it just so happened that it was a [expletive] huge one.”Murphy continued, “I have always said publicly and privately, to Chris, that if I’m available and you want me to be in a movie, I’m there. I don’t really care about the size of the part. But deep down, secretly, I was desperate to play a lead for him.”The “Peaky Blinders” star added, “You realize this is a huge responsibility. [J. Robert Oppenheimer] was complicated and contradictory and so iconic. But you know you’re with one of the great directors of all time. I felt confident going into it with Chris. He’s had a profound impact on my life, creatively and professionally. He’s offered me very interesting roles over and I’ve found all of them really challenging. And I just love being on his sets.”Murphy praised Nolan’s on-set practices, noting, “Any actor would want to be on a Chris Nolan set, just to see how it works and to witness his command of the language of film and the mechanics of film and how he’s able to use that broad canvas within the mainstream studio system to make these very challenging human stories.”Plus, the “old fashioned approach” to marketing “Oppenheimer” has created a buzz of mystery around the epic film.“The question will be how Chris presents it,” Murphy said. “I think people will be very surprised and wowed by what he does. Anything I say will just seem a bit lame as compared to seeing this in an IMAX theater. I’m really proud of the movie and I’m really proud of what Chris has achieved. This was, for sure, a special one, certainly because of the history with me and Chris. We were not walking around the set high-fiving, but it did feel special. It’s an event every time he releases a film, and rightly so. Whether I’m in them or not, I always go to see his movies.”Universal Pictures opens “Oppenheimer” on July 21.",

        "title": "‘Love Again’ Review: Not Even Celine Dion Can Save This Wildly Contrived Rom-Com from Its Own Sadness",
        "content": "It’s never a great sign when the funniest part of your romantic comedy involves the female lead’s flawless boyfriend being killed by a drunk driver in the opening scene (picture Priyanka Chopra Jonas’ smiling face locked in a wide-eyed, ultra-slow-motion close-up as Keegan DeWitt’s lush and bouncy score is suddenly replaced by the Wilhelm scream of screeching tires), but in fairness to James C. Strouse’s absurd “Love Again,” this unclassifiable whatsit isn’t a traditional rom-com so much as a grief drama with a severe identity disorder. Based on a German film called “SMS für Dich” — which sadly doesn’t mean what it sounds like — Strouse’s moribund yet almost intoxicatingly strange new movie is more or less exactly what you would expect to happen if the guy behind depressive indies like “Lonesome Jim” and “Grace Is Gone” decided to make a poppy date flick that adhered to the rhythms and logic of a Lindsay Lohan vehicle from 2006.Yes, most of the laugh lines in “Love Again” are stale enough that even just hearing them kind of hurts your teeth, but for all of its blatant ridiculousness, this movie seldom tries to be funny. Don’t be fooled by the snarky gay best friend, the advice-giving sister, or the freak lightning storm that magically connects Chopra Jonas’ character to the world’s most chiseled music critic (Sam Heughan) through the mystical powers of their Sony mobile phones: “Love Again” might be possessed by the spirit of a rom-com, but it’s as deadly serious as a Celine Dion power ballad. Celine Dion… what a totally random point of comparison, right? WRONG! The Quebecois singer — who seems to be something of a magnet for batshit movies that hinge on her life story, uses this once as a chance to reflect on her own lost love — proves crucial to this mixed-up tale about two strangers teaching each other how their hearts might go on.Rob Burns (Heughan) is no stranger to the power of love, specifically its power to crush you into a million tiny pieces. His work has been suffering as of late, and while that seems to be explained by the fact that he’s clearly never listened to a single piece of music in his entire life (the character’s entire personality is that he watches Knicks games alone on his couch with a basketball in his lap), his editor seems to believe that it’s because Rob was recently dumped just a week before his wedding. Rob’s lucky that he looks like a Scottish Tom Brady, and luckier still that he’s been assigned to write about Dion’s first American tour in 10 years. Not only is Rob so bad at his job that the singer (playing herself) take a personal interest in his incompetence, but — in the aftermath of some purple lightning above Manhattan — the work phone he’s given to record his interview starts receiving the voluminous text messages that children’s author Mira Ray (Chopra Jonas) has been sending to her dead partner as a healing exercise. It’s been two years since the tragedy, and Mira is basically still stuck in the “hide yourself away from the world” stage of grief. She’s living in her parents’ house, the caterpillar she’s famous for drawing seems like it’s never going to turn into a butterfly, and her punchy younger sister Suzy (an effervescent Sofia Barclay) is so desperate to get Mira some Dich that she even creates a Bumble profile for her. Watching Chopra Jonas and Barclay turn to the camera and say “that’s the dating app where the girl gets to make the first move!” was enough to make me wonder if “Love Again” might not be weirdly serious for a rom-com, but rather weirdly romantic for a piece of sponsored content. Anyway, Rob obviously becomes infatuated with the rando who’s spamming his phone with messages about how much she misses his scent, and, with the help of his bowtied co-worker Billy (Russell Tovey), even more obviously contrives a way to cross paths with her in real life. That his plan involves sitting through several dozen opera performances of “Orpheus and Eurydice” in the hopes of catching sight of his mystery crush — rather than, say, standing outside the entrance of the theater and waiting for her to walk by — epitomizes the fiercely romantic but utterly inane spirit of a film that’s far too love drunk to make sense of its sobering tone. For a story whose third act (kind of) pivots on a random job offer from Celine Dion, “Love Again” could hardly be more predictable. From the moment that Rob endeavors to find Mira, you know that he’s going to hide the fact that he’s been getting her dead boyfriend’s texts, you know that they’ll eventually rekindle each other’s dormant romantic streak (cue: “It’s All Coming Back to Me Now”), only for Mira to discover the truth behind their meet-cute about eight seconds after they finally have sex. Not to begrudge a rom-com its conventions, but the scene where Mira learns Rob’s secret — and then storms out of his apartment without any follow-up questions! — goes a long way towards exposing the disconnect between the heaviness of Strouse’s hand and the silliness of his plot. There’s something admirable about the sterility of his direction, which resists the easy charm that most rom-coms rely upon to pave over their plot holes, but Strouse forfeits too much of the levity that “Love Again” needs to remain light on its feet. It doesn’t help that Chopra Jonas and Heughan have all the spark of a rusty lighter in the middle of a rainstorm, even though Chopra Jonas eases into her natural radiance once Mira begins to relax around Rob (an unmotivated turn that happens in the blink of an eye). Or that even Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert would struggle for something to hold onto amidst such oppressively forced circumstances; one problem with devoting roughly 45 minutes of a film to aerial shots of New York City is that it doesn’t leave a lot of time for the lead actors to develop their characters any deeper than they appear on the page.It certainly doesn’t help that Dion puts the emphasis on the wrong word when she tells Rob that he has “the presence of a pair of used underwear,” as if the perfect man should boast the charisma of some freshly laundered Fruits of the Loom. But Dion’s questionable acting talents shouldn’t distract from the fact that her voice remains as commanding as ever, and — wouldn’t you know it — the first of the five new songs that she wrote for this movie’s Sony Music soundtrack is available to download now. Here’s hoping they stir up stronger emotions than the film that inspired them.A Sony release, “Love Again” is now playing in theaters.",

        "content": "All is not fair in “Shakespeare in Love” and Oscars war.Gwyneth Paltrow is looking back on her 1999 Best Actress win for “Shakespeare in Love” and the icy reception to her beating out fellow nominees like Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett.“Once I won the Oscar, it put me into a bit of an identity crisis because if you win the biggest prize, like, what are you supposed to do? And where are you supposed to go?” Paltrow said on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast. “It was hard the amount of attention that you receive on a night like that and the weeks following, it’s so disorienting. And frankly, really unhealthy. I was like, ‘This is crazy. I don’t know what to do, I don’t know which way is up.’ It was a lot. Not that I would give it back or anything, it was an amazing experience, but it kind of called a lot of things into question for me.”Paltrow recalled being mocked for crying onstage while accepting the award. The “Iron Man” star revealed that emotions were high in part due to her father Bruce Paltrow being sick with cancer; he later died in 2002.“I remember I was working in England, and I remember the British press being so horrible to me because I cried. And they didn’t necessarily know that my father was dying of cancer,” Paltrow said. “He was really debilitated. It was just this totally overwhelming moment. And, you know, I was 26. I cried and people were so mean about it and I just thought, ‘Wow there’s this big energy shift that’s happening. I think I’m going to have to learn to be less openhearted and much more protective of myself and filter people out better.'”She added, “I felt a real pivot on that night because I felt like up until that moment everybody was kind of rooting for me in a way. And then when I won, it was like too much, and I could feel a real turn.”Paltrow’s Academy Award win for the scandal-ridden film led her to step away from the spotlight as she “hid for three weeks” at her parents’ house. “It was so intense. Lonely is the right word, it was really strange,” the “Sliding Doors” star said on the “Anna Faris Is Unqualified” podcast in 2021. “It was the weirdest most surreal time. You’re also kind of embarrassed that you’re nominated for an Oscar and you have imposter syndrome and you think, ‘I can’t even believe this is happening. I’m not even that good. Does everybody hate me?'”",

        "content": "Filmmaker and iconic music video director Anton Corbijn is turning his camera on the most recognizable album covers of all time.From the director of “Control” and classic New Wave music videos from the likes of Depeche Mode and Joy Division, “Squaring the Circle (The Story of Hipgnosis)” charts the legacy of the design studio behind iconic rock imagery like Pink Floyd’s “Dark Side of the Moon” album cover. IndieWire shares the exclusive trailer for the film below.“Squaring the Circle” captures the story behind co-founders Aubrey “Po” Powell and late visionary Storm Thorgerson, the creative geniuses behind the London-based iconic album art design studio, Hipgnosis. As Hipgnosis, the pair were responsible for some of the most recognizable album covers of all time, including “Dark Side of the Moon,” Paul McCartney and Wings’ “Band on the Run” and Led Zeppelin’s “Houses of the Holy,” all celebrating their 50th anniversaries this year. While Storm and Po never played a note, they certainly changed how we see music.“Squaring the Circle” includes interviews with Hipgnosis co-founder Powell, along with detailed stories from musicians like Paul McCartney, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Peter Gabriel, and Noel Gallagher. Trish D. Chetty serves as writer and producer, along with Colin Firth and Ged Doherty. Nick Angel, George Chignell, and Andrew Hulme are among the executive producers. Martijn Van Broekhuizen (The 1975’s “Settle Down”) serves as the cinematographer.Dutch director Corbijn previously helmed Joy Division’s Ian Curtis biopic “Control” and music videos for Depeche Mode’s “Enjoy the Silence,” U2’s “One,” Nirvana’s “Heart-Shaped Box,” and Coldplay’s “Viva la Vida.” Corbijn served as the creative director behind the respective visual outputs of Depeche Mode and U2, handling the principal promotion and sleeve photography for both bands over three decades. He also helmed feature films “The American” starring George Clooney and “A Most Wanted Man,” marking Philip Seymour Hoffman’s final role.Upon the film’s Telluride premiere, IndieWire’s Christian Blauvelt noted Corbijn’s use of animation and “strong journalistic chops” in capturing a moment in time for rock and roll history. “These interviews are great,” Blauvelt wrote in his review. “There’s something hope-giving about all these stories, especially in this time when artists continually have to place limits on themselves.”“Squaring the Circle (The Story of Hipgnosis)” premieres June 7 at the Film Forum in New York from Utopia ahead of a nationwide rollout.

        "content": "Mark Hamill is honoring his late “Star Wars” co-star Carrie Fisher on the informal “Star Wars Day” May the 4th, which coincides with Fisher receiving a long-overdue star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.Fisher’s turn as Princess Leia in 1977’s “Star Wars: A New Hope” marked only her second film role following “Shampoo.” Fisher was 19 years old, five years younger than Hamill, who recalled meeting her for the first time over dinner in a new interview with Variety.“I was completely unprepared for the person I met, who just was overwhelming, in the sense that she seemed so much wiser than her years,” Hamill said. “Very funny, very spontaneous, very witty, disarmingly candid.”Hamill continued, “[She was] the perfect person in the perfect role. She was as far from a damsel in distress as you could get. She was in charge of her own rescue. I think that first impression that the audience got really established how they perceived Carrie overall, and she just grew from there.”After the immediate success of the original film, Hamill recalled that Fisher was the first among the ensemble cast to embrace the newfound fame, realizing that “the good far outweighs the bad.”“She embraced it in a way that was far beyond me,” Hamill said. “She loved going to the conventions, meeting the fans. She just reveled in it.”Hamill summed up, “It’s hard to think of her in the past tense. There are people that you encounter in life that are so vibrant and make such a profound impact on you, they stay with you forever. Had she only done Princess Leia, that would be enough. Had she just written one book, that alone would be something that would be enough to satisfy someone who wanted to make a mark on the world. But she did it from every different direction. She really was just such an original.”Fisher died at age 60 in December 2016. Daughter Billie Lourd later revealed that “The Rise of Skywalker” was “going to be Leia’s movie” focused on her character.Lourd recently shared that she did not invite Fisher’s siblings, Todd and Joely Fisher, to her mother’s May 4 Walk of Fame ceremony.“Unfortunately, because they publicly attacked me, I have to publicly respond,” Lourd wrote in a press statement (via The Hollywood Reporter). “The truth is I did not invite them to this ceremony. They know why.”The “American Horror Story” actress added, “Days after my mom died, her brother and her sister chose to process their grief publicly and capitalize on my mother’s death, by doing multiple interviews and selling individual books for a lot of money, with my mom and my grandmother’s deaths as the subject. I found out they had done this through the press. They never consulted me or considered how this would affect our relationship. The truth of my mom’s very complicated relationship with her family is only known by me and those who were actually close to her. Though I recognize they have every right to do whatever they choose, their actions were very hurtful to me at the most difficult time in my life. I chose to and still choose to deal with her loss in a much different way.”Lourd concluded, “To be clear — there is no feud. We have no relationship. This was a conscious decision on my part to break a cycle with a way of life I want no part of for myself or my children.”",

        "title": "Apichatpong Weerasethakul Isn’t Afraid of Artificial Intelligence",
        "content": "Eight years ago, the most famous Thai director in the world told IndieWire that was finished making movies in Thailand. After the release of his haunting “Cemetery of Splendour,” Apichatpong Weerasethakul said the threat of censorship had become too much for him. “I’ll say about a topic, ‘Hey, you cannot say that because you’ll be in jail,’” he said. “I’ve started to feel suffocated by this limitation.”Weerasethakul — he goes by “Joe,” perhaps as an act of mercy for Westerners who struggle to pronounce his name — has only started the international phase of his career. “Memoria,” his first movie made outside of Thailand, became the country’s official Oscar submission in 2021. He’s already planning another one in Sri Lanka.Yet Thailand remains the one place he feels most comfortable even as his work takes him elsewhere. He was calling from the northeastern region of the country while visiting his mother. Thirty years into a career of dreamlike cinematic creations and installation art, the 52-year-old filmmaker travels constantly but always finds his way back home.“For a long time, Thailand hasn’t been that easy to live in, but there’s a lot of reasons to love being here,” he said. “It’s not only about my career. We move a lot for different things, mainly for love. I think if I find love of a location or person or people, that could be part of a reason to move, but not yet.”The filmmaker’s latest path has found him on a cross-country journey through the United States as he works to restore much of his work from the past 30 years. Last month, he attended retrospectives of his films at the Pacific Film Archive in Berkeley and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis ahead of a final stop at New York’s Film at Lincoln Center for a retrospective that includes rare prints of his earlier films and other work that has inspired him (the series includes everything from Frederick Wiseman’s simian portrait “Primate” to Russ Meyers’ “Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!” and John Cassavetes’ “Opening Night,” a range that encapsulates the way Weerasethakul’s work merges documentary observation with otherworldliness).Weersethakul’s movies submerge the viewer into mysterious and meditative soundscapes, which stand in striking contrast to the messiness of today’s home viewing standards. From the ethereal drift of his ghostly hospital drama “Syndromes and a Century” through the spiritual beings that haunt the forest of Palme d’Or winner “Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives,” Weerasethakul’s movies demand an attentive audience to get lost in their mysteries. Good luck doing that at home.“I don’t consider them my films when they show on the smaller screen,” he said. “I’ve been resisting streaming a lot.” When Neon, the U.S. distributor for “Memoria,” decided to release the film exclusively in theaters one city at a time indefinitely, he embraced the decision. “With all these arthouses and independent cinemas struggling in this time of change, it was really important,” he said. He didn’t enjoy the same luxury at home. “I think we’re going with Netflix in Thailand,” he said, with a sheepish grin. “We no longer have small cinemas here.”Though Weerasethakul graduated from the Art Institute of Chicago over 25 years ago, the U.S. still has a foreign quality to him. “America feels like it’s changing each time I visit,” he said. “There’s an issue of race that I don’t understand. There’s a sense of looking back and trying to approach it that way. I’m not sure I understand this complexity. It would be hard to penetrate that if I worked here.”Coming from another director, that statement might register as naive. Yet Weerasethakul, who led a filmmaking retreat in the Amazon last year that started each day with meditation, doesn’t relate to the world in terms of race, ethnicity, or any other conventional boundaries of human identity. His movies have a transcendent power that often creates the impression of another dimension creeping into this one. “My films have a shared sense of being, this awareness of suffering and joy,” he said. “I hope it’s something very universal.”That may be why he’s one of the few major directors who shows no fear of artificial intelligence encroaching on his process. Last year, he created the VR project “A Conversation With the Sun,” and also wrote an accompanying book that he wrote in collaboration with GPT-3, well before OpenAI’s chatbot became a mainstream media fixture. The VR component blends footage from his personal archive with AI-rendered images of famous artists. “VR is a distinct language,” he said. “It isn’t going to jeopardize cinema.”He was skeptical of arguments against the application of AI in the arts community. “Personally, I am happy to witness its progress and impact,” he said. “People need to govern AI because the fear of powerlessness, of losing authority, safety, et cetera. … This idea of an insecure reality has always been in mankind.” By contrast, he was gratified by the process of collaborating with a machine. “Our relationship with knowledge has always been shifting,” he said. “Knowledge used to be exclusive. Now it is common, shared, cheap. Likewise, artistic skill is no longer exclusive. Al is part of that shift. Does it create more psychological pollution? The human mind has always been polluted or programmed.”As an itinerant artist adverse to commercial endeavors — he survives on grants and government subsidies — Weerasethakul has little relationship to Hollywood beyond armchair observations. But he isn’t concerned about the art form. “I love technology and trying new things,” he said. “But I think cinema has its own roots. It will continue on its way.”“The World of Apichatpong Weerasethakul” runs at the Film at Lincoln Center May 4-16.",

        "title": "Mohammad Rasoulof Banned from Leaving Iran to Serve on Cannes Jury",
        "content": "Mohammad Rasoulof revealed he was invited to serve on the 2023 Cannes Un Certain Regard jury but was forced to turn down the spot due to a travel ban from his home nation of Iran.Per Radio France Internationale (RFI), Rasoulof was prevented from leaving Iran to attend the French festival. RFI also reported that Cannes organizers are still trying to provide conditions for Rasoulof to be in attendance. The director formerly received the Best Director award in the Un Certain Regard section at Cannes in 2011 for “Goodbye” and won the FIPRESCI prize in 2013 for “Manuscripts Don’t Burn,” followed by the Un Certain Regard award for “A Man of Integrity” in 2017.The 2023 Cannes Un Certain Regard jury will be overseen by jury president John C. Reilly and consists of French director and screenwriter Alice Winocour, German actress Paula Beer, Franco-Cambodian director and producer Davy Chou, and Belgian actress Émilie Dequenne.Rasoulof has been imprisoned multiple times since 2008 and has not been allowed to leave Iran since 2017, according to the order of the judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Rasoulof has continued his film career, winning the Golden Bear Award at the 2020 Berlinale for “There Is No Evil.” However, the filmmaker also could not attend that festival due to a similar Iranian government ban. Rasoulof was arrested again in July 2022 for posting statements criticizing government-sanctioned violence against protesters. Iranian officials detained the director alongside Jafar Panahi, who was released from prison in March 2023 following a hunger strike and whom Rasoulof supported during Panahi’s incarceration. Panahi has since been able to travel outside of Iran for the first time in 14 years, flying to France on April 25, according to RFI sources.Rasoulof was released in February 2023 from the Evin jail in Tehran after being transferred to a hospital for treatment and later pardoned and released. Rasoulof was sentenced to one year of penal servitude and a two-year ban from leaving Iran on the charge of “propaganda against the regime,” according to his lawyer.",

        "title": "Paramount Doesn’t Sound Too Concerned About the Writers Strike",
        "content": "Look, Paramount Global President and CEO Bob Bakish likes writers, but he doesn’t sound all that concerned about the WGA strike.When asked about the writers strike during a conference call with media analysts, Bakish praised the value of the position as “an essential part of creating content” before acknowledging the “pretty big gap” between studios and the WGA. He then got down to business; after all, this was an earnings call.“We’ve been planning for this,” Bakish said on Thursday, adding that Paramount has “many levers to pull” to offset any major financial impact. Those pulleys include deploying his new productions already in the can, writer-less reality/unscripted programming (“Where we’re definitely a leader”), a large library, and live sports.“And so we can do more in those areas, if necessary,” Bakish continued. He also pointed to Paramount’s pile of international production, which it’s “been moving to leverage pre-strike anyway.”With all that, “consumers really won’t notice anything for a while,” Bakish said, citing the exception of late-night, like CBS’ “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” Those shows immediately went dark due to the WGA strike.“So we’re well-positioned to navigate [the strike],” Bakish said. “In terms of financial impact, it really ultimately depends on duration of strike. But at this point, we think it’s probably slightly dilutive to revenue, flat on OBIDA, and accretive… to cash.” (Translation: Advertising and subscription revenue may slightly dip, operating income will remain the same, and Paramount may actually end up with some extra cash lying around.)And if all that doesn’t work, Paramount sounds pretty opportunistic on A.I. Bakish’s CFO Naveen Chopra praised the general functionality of artificial intelligence earlier in the call. “We’re even doing things like adopting AI for content localization,” he said, “which by the way, produces some really high-quality results and very, very compelling economic.”OK, we know you’re not talking about replacing TV and film writers with A.I., but this was probably one of those times where you just don’t bring the concept up at all. Content localization refers to the translating of local-language content for global audiences.Read all about the company’s Q1 earnings here. The big takeaway there was a massive programming charge mostly tied to the plan to fold Showtime into Paramount+.Shares in Paramount (PARA) are getting creamed this morning; at the time of this writing, the company’s stock is down more than 23 percent.",

        "content": "The Dude is down for a “Big Lebowski” sequel 25 years after its release.Oscar winner Jeff Bridges told People he would be open to reprising his iconic role of The Dude for a follow-up film, so long as writer-directors Joel and Ethan Coen are involved.“Oh God! If the brothers were involved, I certainly would,” Bridges said of returning to the 1998 comedy classic. “The brothers, they’re mysterious and full of surprises. You don’t know what they’re going to do, so since they’re surprising, I don’t think they’ll make a sequel. But like I say, they’re surprising, so maybe they’ll surprise me and make a sequel.”“The Big Lebowski” also starred Ben Gazzara, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, Sam Elliot, Tara Reid, John Turturro, and Philip Seymour Hoffman.Bridges shared that he is in awe that it’s been over two decades since the film premiered. “That movie, I’m so proud to be a part of that movie. What a good one,” he said. “When you hear ‘Lebowski’ was 25 years ago, I say, ‘Come on, man. I can’t believe that.’ It feels like it was maybe five years ago, but 25? I can’t believe it.”Bridges added, “Movies are kind of like your children — they put it all in perspective. They let you know how fast it’s going, because before you know it you’ve got a six-month-old, and then you turn around and she’s 16. Movies are kind of like that.”While no “Lebowski” sequel plans have been set, John Turturro did revisit his Jesus Quintana character for the 2020 film “The Jesus Rolls,” which he wrote and directed. The film doubled as a “Lebowski” spinoff and a remake of the 1974 French movie “Going Places,” directed by Bertrand Blier.Bridges most recently starred in the 2022 FX series “The Old Man” as a CIA operative. The acclaimed show received a second-season order last year. Bridges also revealed a lymphoma diagnosis in 2020 before announcing in 2021 that he’d gone into remission.",

        "title": "‘Who Framed Roger Rabbit’ Would’ve Been a Very Different Movie Directed by Peter Greenaway",
        "content": "Peter Greenaway is the one who turned down “Roger Rabbit.”The “Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover” provocateur claimed in a new interview with Vulture that he was the first director approached to take on 1988’s live-action/animated hybrid classic “Who Framed Roger Rabbit?”“There were people knocking on my door all the time,” Greenaway said. “And looking back, do you remember a film called ‘Who Framed Roger Rabbit?’ I was the first director asked to actually film that. Would you believe that? I found that absolutely extraordinary.”He continued, “I think that was because of a Hollywood agent who didn’t really understand my cinema at all. God bless him. But I was the name to conjure with for six months. So he threw me in there, and I managed to be one of the first directors to actually read the script.”Eventually, Robert Zemeckis helmed the 1988 Touchstone Pictures/Buena Vista mystery-comedy starring Bob Hoskins. Zemeckis courted the film throughout the early 1980s before the studio, skeptical over the box-office bombs of Zemeckis’ earlier films, finally hired him. Greenaway eventually did see “Roger Rabbit” and admired Hoskins’ performance as stressed-out private eye Eddie Valiant.“I always admired that actor, Bob Hoskins. I remember seeing him on British children’s television a long, long time before he became even remotely a name,” Greenaway said. “I like the prospect of combining notions of animation with live action, which became very fashionable after that film, I believe.”The three-time Oscar-winning, rather adult-skewing “Roger Rabbit” would’ve looked like a very different film in the hands of Welsh auteur Greenaway, who in the mid-1980s was making bawdy, high-minded art-inspired films like “A Zed & Two Noughts” and “Belly of an Architect.” His 1988 “Drowning by Numbers” is now being re-released in 4K. Greenaway’s biggest arthouse success was 1989’s “The Cook, The Thief,” starring Helen Mirren and Michael Gambon. The MPA initially slapped the psychosexual gourmand art film with an X rating before Miramax unleashed it unrated in theaters; it grossed over $7.7 million in North America.IndieWire last year spoke with Greenaway about the 4K re-release of “A Zed & Two Noughts,” and he shared feelings about how cinema hasn’t really changed at all since its inception in 1895: “We come up with some grand, amazing phenomenon and maybe we practice its possibilities for a few years, and then we go back to our comfort zone again. Cinema [despite 3D innovation, etc.] is still back to where it was. When Charlie Chaplin was practicing. That’s very much to do with the conservatism of human beings.”",

        "title": "‘Chile ’76’ Review: A Rich Housewife Becomes a Reluctant Spy in Manuela Martelli’s Shrewd Pinochet-Era Thriller",
        "content": "A long-retired Red Cross nurse whose only real plans for the winter of 1976 involve redesigning the inside of her family’s beach house and planning her granddaughter’s seven birthday party, Carmen — played by the elegantly unraveling Aline Kuppenheim — spends her days fussing around with the furniture and waiting for her doctor husband to return from Santiago on the weekend, oblivious to the discordant electric daggers of the Mariá Portugal score that cuts a hole into the soundscape around her. She dreams of a living room that’s soaked in the kiss-pink shade of a Venetian sunset, and at one point is so entranced by a vat of swirling paint that she hardly seems to hear the screams of a young leftist as they’re disappeared off a nearby street in broad daylight. But Carmen is not quite as callous as her Westchester chic wardrobe might suggest. The empathy that once inspired her to be a nurse is still in there somewhere, lying dormant behind the veil of indifference (or denial) that has allowed her to be unbothered by three years of horrifically violent authoritarian rule. There’s a reason why she volunteers to read to the blind, even if that charitable activity belies her own inability to see what’s happening in the world around her. Likewise, there’s a reason why the local priest only trusts Carmen — of all people — to secretly care for a wounded Communist who needs someone to stitch up the hole in his leg, and maybe even understudy his dangerous role in the fight against Pinochetism. Based on that premise, Manuela Martelli’s “Chile ’76” would appear to set up a straightforward paranoid thriller about the moral awakening of a bourgeois housewife. And yet this low-heat but shrewdly compelling debut subverts the reluctant savior narrative from the minute it starts, as Carmen embraces the priest’s clandestine assignment (and doesn’t flinch after she learns the full truth about her patient). What follows from there is an intimate psychosocial character study that — true to the film’s title — unfolds at a national scale. This isn’t a story about one affluent woman’s gradual radicalization against authoritarianism, it’s a story about the illusion of not taking sides. Like the mixed paints that Martelli turns into a recurring motif, their colors melting together without a canvas, there’s no separating the personal from the political. That realization dawns slowly on Carmen, whose penchant for self-medicating her “neuroses” feels like a symptom of a broader denial; as does her decision to abscond to the family beach house each winter, where she can stare at the sea and swan around in a sleek collection of blue dresses and black slacks. For all of her day-dreaming, however, Carmen soon discovers that every inch of Chile is shadowed by the same nightmare (by 1976, no place on Earth was safe from the reach of Pinochet’s regime, as Martelli’s film acknowledges in heartbreaking detail). “Chile ’76” is only a few minutes old before Carmen begins to nurse the handsome young Communist her priest friend is hiding from the authorities, but just as she’s spent the last three years deluding herself about the coup and its casualties, it takes some time for her to understand what kind of movie she’s in. Even after Carmen begins relaying her patient’s life-or-death messages to other members of his network — a process that involves code names, secret drops, and covering her tracks in order to lose any possible tails — much of her focus remains on her granddaughter’s birthday party. Once she lived in denial of Pinochet’s homicidal dictatorship, and now she lives in denial of her role in the resistance to it. The atonal instability of Toru Takemitsu-esque score begins to blare over the soundtrack like a muffled siren in the middle of a windstorm, while the cold sterility of Martelli’s direction renders Carmen’s personal sense of involvement even more irrelevant. There’s no excusing herself from this narrative, and there never was.Martelli’s gauzy script (co-written by Alejandra Moffat) never forces us to forgive Carmen’s privileged remove from the terrors of Pinochetism, nor does it ever explicitly articulate the character’s growing sympathies for the leftists whom she risks her life to help (Carmen readily confesses that she wouldn’t have agreed to help the young man if she knew he was an enemy of the state). Kuppenheim — who looks strikingly young to be a grandmother several times over — embodies Carmen with a virility that suggests she might take some pleasure in reconnecting to her not-so-distant youth, but her growing paranoia gradually overshadows the fun of getting her groove back. How gradually that happens is up for debate, as “Chile ’76” only sinks deeper into subjective psychological territory as its political intrigue grows more intense. Other tellings of this story might place a greater weight on the papers that go missing from Carmen’s glovebox, or provide a clearer answer as to Carmen’s role in the off-screen death of a minor character she meets along the way, but Martelli is more — or even exclusively — interested in how profoundly these happenings rattle her protagonist. If the film starts with Carmen feeling worlds away from someone being abducted right in front of her face, it ends with her being so consumed by her country’s political violence that she can’t even exchange pleasantries with a stranger without assuming that he has an ulterior motive, or that a single wrong word might result in the death of someone she holds dear. That transformation is subtle and spiraling and sometimes even anti-dramatic, as any radical intrusion on Carmen’s white collar life would intrude on the safety of her social status and/or force her to make a clear choice in a film that’s so compelled by the choices that people don’t even realize they’re making. That approach can suck too much of the air out of a movie that wants to be suffocating but not overly suspenseful, and “Chile ’76” has a tendency to sand off its edges whenever any of its thriller elements risk becoming too sharp. But Carmen’s story is meant to end with a whimper, and not a bang. There’s no victory here, nor any climactic defeat, only the bone-deep awareness that authoritarianism anywhere is authoritarianism everywhere. At a certain point there’s no such thing as “not my problem.” At a certain point, no one’s safety is guaranteed.Kino Lorber will release “Chile ’76” in New York theaters on Friday, May 5. It will open at the Laemmle Royal in Los Angeles on Friday, May 19.",

        "title": "May Box Office Could Hit $950 Million, Powered by the Guardians and the Mario Bros.",
        "content": "Well, that’s awkward: We predicted a healthy $650 million box office for April and missed the mark — by a lot. The month’s total was $900 million, thanks to the overwhelming overperformance of “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” (Universal), which initial projections placed at $250 million for its 24 days in April. (And even that felt optimistic.) “SMB” actually took in $491 million in the U.S./Canada for the period.The rest of the month — holdovers “John Wick: Chapter 4” (Lionsgate) and “Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” (Paramount) added just under $150 million, and new releases “Air” (MGM) and “Evil Dead Rise” (Warner Bros. Discovery) combined for over $110 million — came in as expected.April also introduced an unexpected question. As the summer season begins with the traditional Disney Marvel release, will “SMB” suggest a surge in expectations — or does it mean, with perhaps a $650 million domestic total, we’ve already seen the release of 2023’s top title?Three May openings will give strong hints. “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” (Disney) opens Friday. Last year, “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” debuted the same date to an initial $187 million. Projections for the “Guardians 3” debut are about two-thirds of that. Coming off the disappointing “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” ($213 million total U.S./Canada), guesses are conservative.Even so, there are two big reasons to project that May 2023 may beat both May 2022 ($786 million) and April 2023. With a potential $300 million take for “Guardians 3,” along with substantial contributions from three other titles, this month could total $950 million. “SMB” could easily be the #2 film for this month with the potential for another $125 million-$150 million more in the period. Other holdovers this May might add another $60 million-$75 million.May also has three openings that could add significantly more than $100 million this month. Last year had two with “Top Gun: Maverick,” which grossed $176 million over the five-day Memorial Day weekend, and “Dr. Strange.”“The Little Mermaid” (Disney) takes the 2023 Memorial Day placement with six days of play in the month. “The Lion King,” the another live-action remake of a Disney animated classic, grossed $544 million domestically in 2019, though the 1994 film was much bigger than 1989’s animated “Mermaid.”The bigger X factor is “Fast X” (Universal), which opens May 19. That gives it nearly two weeks in the month and the previous two franchise releases grossed between $128 million-$170 million in their first 13 days. This will be a far bigger international success, but figure $125 million this month as a minimum, with better likely.Seven other wide releases by major distributors wide releases will join these three debuts, although four don’t open until May 26. The one with the biggest potential could be “Book Club: The Next Chapter” (Focus), which opens May 12 and could gross $30 million-$40 million.If May sees $950 million, that would be 21 percent better than last year. Last month was a stunning 58 percent better than April 2022, though down 12 percent from 2019. Year to date is 37 percent ahead of 2022 and 14 percent under 2019.If the $950 million projection is correct, we would end the month 32 percent ahead of last year and 13 percent off 2019. That trajectory would result in about $9.7 billion-$9.8 billion domestic gross for 2023, which would be terrific: $9 billion was closer to consensus analyst guesses going into 2023.",

        "content": "Few items are more closely guarded in Hollywood than a new Marvel script. With so many interlocking stories being told simultaneously through films and Disney+ shows, a leak to the studio’s rabid fanbase could spoil a year’s worth of projects in one fell swoop.The importance of secrecy certainly wasn’t lost on Karen Gillan and Pom Klementieff, who reprise their roles as Nebula and Mantis in “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.” The road to the conclusion of James Gunn’s cosmic superhero trilogy has been a long one, with Gunn briefly being fired from the project in 2018 before Marvel quickly re-hired him with the public support of his cast.And that transitional period — when Gunn’s script was still being used but no director was in place — was challenging for the actors involved. They knew they had to stick together, so Gillan and Klementieff decided to secretly meet at Gillan’s house to read the script for the first time.“I came over to Karen’s house and it was at a time where James Gunn was not supposed to do the movie anymore,” Klementieff told IndieWire. “So we decided to read the script together and we cried the whole time.”“We laughed at the same time, then cried again,” Gillan added. “It was quite emotional.”But the bonding experience ended — like so many things do these days — with a disagreement about whether a garden could be used as an underground storage facility for one of the most classified pieces of intellectual property on the planet.“And then I got paranoid that someone would find the script. So I was like, ‘We should hide the script. Maybe we should bury it in the garden,’” Klementieff said. “I like to hide stuff, and then I can’t find it. I’m like a squirrel. That’s one of my problems.”Burying scripts in a co-star’s garden might sound like the kind of bizarre celebrity ritual that could be common in Hollywood — but Gillan made it clear that she was just as baffled by the request as the rest of us.“She legitimately asked me to bury the ‘Guardians of the Galaxy’ script in my garden,” Gillan said with a laugh. “And I was like, ‘What do you mean? Put it in a cupboard or something!’”A Walt Disney release, “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” hits theaters on Friday, May 5.",

        "title": "‘Dune: Part Two’ Trailer: Timothée Chalamet Rides a Sandworm in Denis Villeneuve’s IMAX-Shot Follow-Up",
        "content": "“Do you remember your first ride?”“Dune: Part Two” is continuing the sprawling epic of Denis Villeneuve’s space-set saga with the latest trailer.Tuesday’s teaser gave us an eerie first look at Timothée Chalamet’s Paul Atreides trying to lure a giant sandworm on Arrakis along with eerie tableaux of the ensemble cast. Now, we finally get a full look at “Part Two.” Watch below.The second film returns us to the mythic journey of Paul as he unites with Chani (Zendaya) and the Fremen while on a warpath of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. The Warner Bros. Pictures/Legendary Entertainment film was shot entirely in IMAX by cinematographer Greig Fraser (2022 Oscar winner for “Part One”), whereas only about 40 percent of the original movie was in IMAX. Warner Bros. is going all out with a theatrical release in November, unlike the first movie, which premiered during the pandemic day and date on big screens and HBO Max.Director Villeneuve shared a first look at the sci-fi epic during the 2023 CinemaCon convention, clarifying that he sees the follow-up film as a continuation and “not a sequel” for the first feature, which won six Academy Awards.“‘Part Two’ is more action-packed, epic war movie, much more bulk, much more dance,” Villeneuve said, calling the first “Dune” just an “appetizer” leading into the “main course” of “Part Two.”Villeneuve co-wrote the script with Jon Spaihts, adapting the rest of Frank Herbert’s novel. “Part Two” resurrects Arrakis using entirely new sets and design pieces from the first film. The follow-up also picks up immediately after “Dune” without a time jump.While most of the ensemble “Dune” cast returns, the follow-up film boasts franchise newcomers Florence Pugh, Léa Seydoux, and Austin Butler. Pugh plays Princess Irulan, the daughter of Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), who is the supreme ruler of the galaxy.Pugh’s character is described as a “political chess player” by Villeneueve, with Butler’s sadistic (and bald!) Harkonnen prince Feyd-Rautha is an “Olympic sword master crossed with a psychotic serial killer.”Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, and Rebecca Ferguson reprise their roles from the original film.Villeneuve confirmed that the second installment is in part a love story centered around Chalamet’s Paul and Zendaya’s Chani, who will be getting more screen time as a duo.“I wanted to make a very human movie, very close to the characters, despite the scope of the film,” the auteur told Vanity Fair. “I kept saying to my crew, ‘The most important thing is that spark, that relationship between both of these characters.’ If we don’t capture that, if we don’t have that onscreen, there’s no movie. The epicenter of the story is this relationship.”“Dune: Part Two” will deftly navigate the pitfalls Villeneuve perceived from the first movie, with the Academy Award nominee telling Vanity Fair that he had to “accept [my] failures as an artist” over “Dune.”“It’s a task that was almost impossible, for me to be absolutely faithful to what those childhood dreams were,” Villeneuve said. “But what brings a lot of peace in my heart is that I brought a lot of them to the screen, a lot of them are close to what I had imagined.”“Dune: Part Two” premieres November 3 in theaters.

        "title": "The Sharpie Is Mightier: ‘Pissed Off’ Writers with Clever Signs Make Noise from the WGA Picket Lines",
        "content": "“No pages without fair wages!” “Don’t you want to know how ‘The Last of Us’ ends?” “Please don’t make me have to move back to Ohio!”The WGA Strike of 2023 is now in full swing, and the writers who formed picket lines Tuesday afternoon across Los Angeles and New York City are mad as hell. Speaking of lines, those clever ones above were just a few of the phrases written on the poster boards of Hollywood’s writers as they protested what they feel to be unfair wages, a devaluing of their work by the studios, networks, and streamers, and an “existential” fight for entertainment writing as a viable profession. If you believe the pen to be mightier, maybe don’t mess with writers.“To be out here today and see the unity of writers, to fight for our careers, to keep from turning us into gig workers and keeping our careers stable is incredibly inspiring,” Adam Conover, the creator and host of “Adam Ruins Everything,” told IndieWire from the picket lines Tuesday.“I’ve been in a room with 20 other writers with the AMPTP for the last six weeks,” WGA West President Meredith Stiehm told us. “Seeing everyone out here confirms the solidarity, confirms the energy, and confirms the importance of what we’re doing.”IndieWire was on the scene at the protest in front of Netflix’s offices on the corner of Sunset and Van Ness, where picketers dressed in blue Writers Guild of America t-shirts stretched down each block. We also spotted strikers in front of multiple gates at Paramount Pictures and in front of CBS Studios in Studio City, and picket lines have been stationed at all the major studios in Burbank, Culver City, as well as across New York City.Though the signs are similar, the stakes are far different, and the writers we spoke with demonstrated frustration, outrage, and a commitment to stick it out on the streets for as long is necessary to get a fair deal from the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). The guild’s agreement expired Monday night, and most people you speak with feel we’re in for a long fight. Writers today say they’re battling simply for the ability to have a career, “Murderville” showrunner Krister Johnson told us, and they’re prepared to stick it out because the current conditions are already untenable.“I have watched this go from being what I thought was my dream come true, which is being able to work and build a career in this industry, to something that feels very scary and financially unpredictable, and at times borderline financially unworkable,” Johnson said. “Everyone is already experiencing this career chaos and financial instability. They can’t hold that fear over us anymore.”Protestors chanted phrases like “Corporate greed has got to go” and “No contracts, no scripts,” while others bellowed from bullhorns. Honking from cars up and down Sunset made the noise in the area deafening. We spotted writers and stars from shows like “Hacks,” “Portlandia,” and “The Bear,” not to mention a guy dressed in an actual plush bear costume. Another carried an infant with a “Proud Union Baby” onesie on.Picketers’ signs targeted the town’s entertainment CEOs, who collectively make hundreds of millions of dollars per year — more than the estimated $429 million the WGA is asking for among its proposals for the new minimum bargaining agreement (MBA). Others at the Netflix protest lambasted the streamer specifically, with one sign saying “Netflix’s Residuals are a Joke,” a play on the company’s marketing line for its comedy content.The topic of AI-generated material, on which the guild says the AMPTP refused to even make a counteroffer, was another popular point of contention. “Don’t let M3GAN write ‘M3GAN,'” a sign read in reference to the murderous movie robot.The AMPTP on Monday night said that the “sticking point” in talks involved “mandatory staffing” that would require companies to employ writers whether they were needed or not. Stiehm said on Tuesday that statement was “inaccurate,” claiming the AMPTP was not even willing to have a conversation on the issue.“There’s no way that we couldn’t be here today,” Stiehm said from the ground. “That was a remarkable thing for them to say, because they would not discuss our television proposals, there were a handful of them. That was one of them, and they must’ve thought it was to their advantage to pretend like we’d had some negotiations on it, but they simply would not discuss those issues. They ignored them.”Stiehm said it is the writers guild’s belief that the studios are trying to “shrink writers rooms to the point of non-existence and turn us into freelance writers or gig writers,” which she called “unacceptable.”Conover knows that fear first hand, and he found the studios’ refusal to engage on topics that mean the most to writers to be “insulting.”“Gimme a break. It’s a joke, it’s insulting, and it actually fired up our membership and made them more united. I mean, look at these people. They’re pissed off,” Conover said. “We think they’re going to make us stay out here for a while, because that’s how they roll, and that’s what they did in 2007. But guess what? We can wait them out.”",

        "title": "‘You Can Live Forever’ Review: Earnest Jehovah’s Witness Lesbian Drama Has Few Surprises",
        "content": "As long as religion is so preoccupied with queerness, queer artists must reckon with religion. While the closeted zealot trope may be played out at this point, it seems every sect wants its shot at the clandestine queer romance. Of course, there is plenty of Sapphic fun to be mined from the queering of rituals, sacrifice, and self-flagellation, as with the sensual tension of recent entries like “Disobedience” or the outrageous heresy of “Benedetta.” More somber entries into the sub-genre include 2018’s conversion therapy duo of “Boy Erased” and “The Miseducation of Cameron Post.”Amidst such a crowded field, the Jehovah’s Witness drama “You Can Live Forever” doesn’t quite stand out, short of opening a door into one of the lesser explored religious sects. Though the well-crafted film makes use of a unique regional setting for some moving moments, its straightforward approach to well-worn territory offers few surprises. Set in 1990s Quebec, “You Can Live Forever” follows a teenage girl who becomes involved with a devout Jehovah’s Witness after being sent to live with religious family. Written and directed by Sarah Watts and Mark Slutsky, and based on Watts’ upbringing, “You Can Live Forever” isn’t bound to resonate past audiences with a personal connection to the material.The story follows teenager Jaime (Anwen O’Driscoll), a loner who listens to Siouxsie and the Banshees and tokes up on the train. Following her father’s death, her bereft mother sends her to temporarily live with her Aunt Beth (Liane Balaban) and her husband Jean Francois, both devout Jehovah’s Witnesses. Though Beth appears loving and generally easygoing, she gently makes it clear that attending church, or “meeting,” is non-negotiable. Despite having to ditch her black sweatshirt and jeans for a dowdy floral dress, she still gets the once-over from Marike (June Laporte), the minister’s daughter.Marike is a true believer, and her religious fervor is only matched by her ardent desire to make Jaime her new best friend. She invites Jaime over for dinner, where her family attempts to sway Jaime towards “the truth.” Though Jaime remains skeptical, her interest in Marike is stronger, and she even goes door-knocking as a way of spending more time with her. Throughout multiple sleepovers, they cuddle and get closer, protected from suspicion under the cloak of religious naivete.Lured into a false sense of security and blinded by that first-rush of hormones, they become more brazen. When a full-blown romance begins, it’s only a matter of time before someone catches on. The punishment is not as severe as it could have been, and mercifully “You Can Live Forever” eschews some of the more extreme tropes of religious dramas. The film understands that the real drama, the tragedy of a young person denying themself love in the name of god, needs no embellishment. Marike’s commitment to “the truth” never waivers, and her story ends where Jaime’s begins.Though the beats of the narrative are fairly predictable and the dialogue verges on cliche, “You Can Live Forever” funnels the vast Canadian landscapes and specific period details into a cohesive visual language. A timely cut to green Jello cubes at dinner offers a breath of humor, and the sweeping coastlines and lush greenery are about as dramatic a backdrop one could hope for a grand love story. In tone and subject matter, the film feels in line with its 1992 setting; it may be faithful to a fault, but it’s an impressive craft achievement. Still, the only thing distinguishing it from queer films of yore are a few steamily chaste make-outs and furtive backseat grinding sessions.The performances range in believability and appeal, though the actresses share enough chemistry for the earnest teen romance to translate. Jaime lights up in scenes with her non-religious friend Nathan (Hasani Freeman), who loosens her up with his naturally playful manner. Despite their stoner video game sessions doing much of the heavy lifting to give Jaime a personality, she remains a fairly opaque protagonist to project the story onto. Still, she’s likable enough that her decision to move forward in life feels celebratory. Her commitment to live her own truth never waivers, and her spirit can rest easy knowing that.Good Deed Entertainment will release “You Can Live Forever” in limited theaters and on demand on Friday, May 5.",

        "title": "Another Nicole Kidman AMC Ad Is in the Works: ‘One Version Has Been Written’",
        "content": "Somehow crying tears of joy feels good in a place like this.The viral Nicole Kidman-led AMC ad campaign may be warranting a follow-up segment, according to AMC CEO Adam Aron.“It’s being decided right now. I’m not sure when we’re going to do it — this year or next year,” Aron told Variety. “One version has been written, but whether that’s the one we make or not, I don’t know. We’ll all see it together. We’ll try to live up to your expectations when the time comes.”Oscar winner Kidman appeared in the commercial that first debuted in September 2021 featuring a script written by “Captain Phillips” scribe Billy Ray.Aron continued about the partnership with Kidman, “She’s happy to hear it. I’ll share this with you. On June 10, Nicole Kidman is being honored by the American Film Institute and getting its 49th Life Achievement Award. AMC is going to be a major sponsor of that gala in great tribute to the First Lady of AMC, Nicole Kidman. Becoming associated with her has been one of the smartest marketing decisions that I’ve been a part of for the last 40 years.”The AMC ad was referenced during the 2023 Oscars and spurred a “Saturday Night Live” parody, which Aron called a “wonderful” homage.“I actually thought our commercial was better than their parody. But I’ll tell you how I decided whether I liked it or didn’t. If ‘SNL’ had done that for any other theater chain, would I have been upset? The answer is, yeah,” Aron said. “If they had done that for someone else’s movie theaters, I would have been crazed out of my mind.”He added, “Similarly, I don’t know if you were watching the Oscars, but the first gag in Jimmy Kimmel’s monologue was to Nicole Kidman, about how she’d been released from an AMC movie theater. That’s the highest compliment we can be paid. That says our commercial hit the American zeitgeist.”Kidman reflected on the impact of the AMC ad last year, revealing that she became connected with CEO Aron through “Being the Ricardos” director Jeff Cronenweth.“I just wanted to support AMC, but he’s a great guy,” Kidman told The Playlist of Aron. “Thinking out of the box and defying the odds. Go Adam!”She added of the iconic “heartbreak feels good in a place like this” line, “It’s so true. How true is it too? I mean, talk about not feeling alone, sitting in a cinema with a broken heart, and then watching something that breaks your heart again, and you go, ‘I’m not alone.’ Please. This must not go away. We have to have cinema.”",

        "content": "Nicolas Cage is carrying the unbearable weight of an in utero memory.The Oscar winner and “Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent” star shared on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” that his earliest memory is as an unborn child and seeing “faces in the dark” of his mother’s womb.“Listen, I know this sounds really far out and I don’t know if it’s real or not,” Cage said during the “Colbert Questionert” rapid-fire Q&A, “but sometimes I think I can go all the way back to in-utero and feeling like I could see faces in the dark or something.”He continued, “I know that sounds powerfully abstract, but that somehow seems like maybe it happened. Now that I am no longer in utero, I would have to imagine it was perhaps vocal vibrations resonating through to me at that stage. That’s going way back. I don’t know. That comes to mind.”Cage added, “I don’t even know if I remember being in utero, but that thought has crossed my mind.”The “Renfield” actor also shared his thoughts on the afterlife, saying, “Nobody really knows, I don’t know. They say that electricity is forever eternal. That the spark keeps going. I like to think whatever spark is animating our bodies, once the body passes on, that the spark continues to go. But whether or not that electricity has consciousness or not, who can really say?”Cage’s career certainly has had multiple incarnations, with Cage opening up last year to GQ about the highs and lows over his seemingly nine lives in Hollywood.“The phone stopped ringing. It was like, ‘What do you mean we’re not doing “National Treasure 3″? It’s been 14 years. Why not?’ Well, ‘”Sorcerer’s Apprentice” didn’t work, and “Ghost Rider” didn’t really sell tickets. And “Drive Angry,” that just came and went,’” Cage said while reflecting on his multiple direct-to-video movies. “I’ve got all these creditors and the IRS and I’m spending $20,000 a month trying to keep my mother out of a mental institution, and I can’t. It was just all happening at once.”",

        "content": "Haley Lu Richardson is reflecting on the horror film that got away.The “White Lotus” Season 2 star revealed that she turned down auditioning for Ari Aster’s “Midsommar” due to having already starred in “disturbing” film “Split,” written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan.“There are a lot [of roles] that got away. But I did get the script for ‘Midsommar,'” Richardson told Backstage. “I remember reading it; it was such a well-written, creepy script. I actually still haven’t seen the movie because I kind of can’t bring myself to watch it.”She continued, “They wanted to meet me. I had actually done ‘Split,’ I think, a year or two before [in 2016]. And I was like, ‘I don’t want to do another disturbing movie right now. I just don’t have it in me, going around and crying at these disturbing things. It wasn’t something that I wanted, and I felt really strongly about that. So I didn’t even take the meeting.”Richardson added, “And, you know, that’s a pretty iconic movie, isn’t it? But I do think that everything happens the way that it’s supposed to. There was a reason I didn’t have it in me. And also, Florence Pugh is just such a good actor.”“Midsommar” breakout actress Pugh recently admitted to “abusing” herself during the intense production. Pugh played Dani in the 2019 thriller, a psychology grad student whose toxic relationship unravels while visiting a cult-like community in Sweden.“When I did it, I was so wrapped up in her and I’ve never had this ever before with any of my characters,” Pugh said during the “Off Menu” podcast. “I’d never played someone that was in that much pain before, and I would put myself in really shitty situations that maybe other actors don’t need to do but I would just be imagining the worst things.”Pugh recalled, “Each day the content would be getting more weird and harder to do. I was putting things in my head that were getting worse and more bleak. I think by the end I probably, most definitely abused my own self in order to get that performance.”",

        "title": "The 2023 Writers Strike Explained: How We Got Here — and What to Expect",
        "content": "The writers strike has officially begun. The Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) failed to reach a deal on a new minimum bargaining agreement (MBA) by the deadline of May 1, leading for the guild to call its first strike since 2008. Writers are hitting the picket lines beginning Tuesday, and Hollywood is bracing for what could be a massive disruption to the film and TV industry.Writers say they want a living wage as streaming devalues their work even as it demands more of their time. Studios say the guild is asking too much at the wrong time — streaming has to focus on revenue when it used to value subscriber counts.There’s a lot more to it than that, of course. No one “wants” a strike, but it appears that both sides are far apart and could be digging their heels in for quite a while.In recent weeks, IndieWire approached the writer’s strike from the ground level, speaking to writers from different backgrounds — including a feature film writer, a narrative TV writer for both broadcast and streaming, and a veteran late night comedy writer — each of whom faces different challenges. Here’s what’s at stake, how we got here, how long a strike could last, and what it all means.The guild said late Monday after negotiations concluded that the studios were trying to turn writing into a “gig economy” and threaten to turn writing into a “freelance profession.” The studios on the other hand said the biggest sticking points were the guild’s requirements for “mandatory staffing” and “duration of employment,” which the AMPTP says are “Guild proposals that would require a company to staff a show with a certain number of writers for a specified period of time, whether needed or not.”The WGA went a step further and published its full list of proposals offered as of May 1, along with the AMPTP’s counter offer (some of which came with no counter offer at all). The first big gap concerns money. The guild says that its proposals would amount to an extra $429 million per year coming writers’ way, whereas the studios’ counter offers them only an extra $86 million per year. For what it’s worth, “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” grossed worldwide in a single weekend what the writers are asking for in raises.But while there was some give between the two sides on recalculating residuals formulas or raises to minimum wages, as well as even some tentative agreements over span protection and other factors, guild leadership said in an interview that the AMPTP refused to even hear out their proposals on what the guild considers core, “existential” issues, and in that regard, both sides remain very far apart.Among those are the issues of minimum staffing on shows, doing screenwriting work effectively for free, asking for the same protections for working on variety shows for streamers as those who work in broadcast (and instead offering a “day rate), and refusing to even engage on the subject of using AI-generated material. The studios also did not offer a counter proposal when the guild asked for a “viewership-based residual,” such that hit streaming shows pay out more than a show that isn’t as successful, which suggests that the studios still see its data as top secret.On April 17, WGA members overwhelmingly approved a strike authorization vote, which gave the guild permission from its over 11,500 television and movie writers to initiate a strike once the two sides were unable to make a deal. That strike authorization vote was approved by 97.78 percent of the members who voted, a record for the guild in terms of unity but also in terms of members who submitted ballots. It gives the guild a lot of leverage in the remaining days of talks with the AMPTP and proves they mean business.Back during 2017’s negotiations, there was a similar vibe around town and the strike authorization vote approval was nearly as high… but the guild and the studios averted a strike at the last minute. That didn’t happen here.In the last few months, producers began stockpiling scripts. Studios greenlit projects and raced to begin production while pitches for other new business dwindled and the market slowed. Not great signs that things are going to improve any time soon.Back in 2007, the WGA fought for regulated payment over content moving to “new media,” i.e. streaming before anyone knew to call it streaming. At that point, Netflix was a DVD company that had just introduced streaming, but enough content lived online that writers knew they had to make a move. In the 100-day work stoppage that extended into February 2008, talk shows and other variety shows ground to a halt. TV series like “30 Rock,” “The Big Bang Theory,” or “Heroes” saw their seasons cut short, while others like “24” or “Entourage” were delayed altogether.It meant a whole lot of reruns, reality shows, and game shows. Some late-night hosts found ways to keep their non-writing staffs paid for a period of time; some late-night shows returned to the air without writers until the strike was resolved. A 2008 report in the Los Angeles Times estimated that the strike cost the local economy $2.1 billion and that didn’t take into account all the ripple effects on other industries nationwide or the impact it had on individual crew members.After the strike, streamers were obligated to hire WGA writers and writers received 1.2% of a distributor’s gross receipts for rentals. For ad-supported streaming, writers were granted 2% of gross receipts after the first 17 days. Attempts to place reality and animation writers under the WGA failed. There was no determination around subscription-based streaming because, at the time, it barely existed.Now that a strike has begun, it will mean writing work will immediately halt for movies, television, and streaming. Just as before, late-night talk shows will almost instantly stop producing new episodes, and variety shows like “Saturday Night Live” or “Last Week Tonight” will be forced to cut their seasons short if the strike carries on. Late night hosts are still expected to pay their non-striking staffs while dark this time around.While many of the highest-profile broadcast or cable series are already in the can, it might not take long before viewers notice an impact and see the fall season and returns of shows delayed, as writers generally begin work on the season in May or June. The WGA recently sent a letter to media analysts and investors (read it here) indicating that during the 2007-08 strike, almost 25 percent of all primetime, scripted programming during that network season was lost, and it singled out shows like “Abbott Elementary,” “NCIS,” or “Chicago Med” that could be delayed.Largely unaffected would be reality shows, game shows, news, sports, and other unscripted programming. If streamers and studios have more leverage now than they did in 2007, it’s because there are more avenues now for streamers to lean on international programming that are outside the WGA. IndieWire even reported that a recent dip in the market for documentary films and series could see a renewed surge of interest if networks and streamers are forced to turn to more unscripted documentaries for content.With movies, the impacts could be felt not this year but next year, should projects that are in the pipeline now get delayed or are not able to start shooting on schedule because of a work stoppage. The longer a strike goes, the more pronounced those problems become.It’s possible that they may feel less pressure, initially: 16 years ago, streaming was in its infancy and viewing options were much more limited. The constant feed of on-demand content means no one faces the same kind of rerun exhaustion.That said, there’s still the problem of no TV shows and movies, which drive subscribers and retention. All streamers are reckoning with revenue and the reality that making money with these resource-intensive platforms is more challenging than it initially appeared.Much of the broadcast or cable content people watch the next day on streamers like Hulu, Peacock, or Paramount+ would be affected by any delays to the broadcast season, and that also could impact on a streamer’s subscriber growth and bottom line. Many streamers though, most notably Netflix, will be able to weather the storm for longer with slates planned out months in advance.Writers are demanding higher wages that can keep up with inflation, content spends, and company profits. A streaming boom lead to waves of content, but writers feel they are being asked to do more for less. Ahead of negotiations, the WGA said median weekly pay for writers-producers has declined four percent over the last decade; adjusted for inflation, the decline is 23 percent. The median number of working weeks for TV staff writers, showrunners, and screenwriters has increased, even though the number of episodes on an average season has dropped from roughly 21 episodes in the old days to eight to 12 episodes today. Writers who are paid per episode saw their average pay dwindle — sometimes to at minimum wage, if not below.Many writers rely on residuals from their work being re-aired or distributed as a long-term source of income, but these are also evaporating. The dominance of streaming means fewer TV episodes available; for programming like reality shows or variety, late night, and talk shows produced for streaming, the residuals range from inconsistent to nonexistent. In film, residuals have all but disappeared as streamers hold on to their content; there’s no afterlife in syndication, cable, or DVDs.Another trend WGA wants to rein in is the “mini-room” in which a group of writers come up with stories for a full season of a show before hiring a full writing staff. This format can allow a singular writer or showrunner to hatch a show’s entire arc (think of Taylor Sheridan and “Yellowstone” or Mike White and “The White Lotus”), but as one mini-room writer recently explained to IndieWire, in practice it means writers do the full amount of work for far less pay. If they develop storylines well in advance, a streamer or network may only have to pay if the show is picked up to a second season.This is one of the biggest sticking points in negotiations, as the WGA wants to see a minimum amount of people staffed and paid during these “pre-greenlight rooms” as well as for some to even remain on staff during and after production. Many streamers though may not greenlight a show until after all the scripts are written, which led to studios refusing to make a counter proposal.And then there’s the AI question. The technology is in its infancy, but the guild sees how studios might view AI as the screenwriting workhorse they’ve always wanted. AI-generated material often bases its results on guild-protected, copyrighted material, but that work emerges without credit or payment. The guild is fighting to make sure AI can’t be used to rewrite a script or that a robot can’t be covered by the guild’s bargaining agreement. The guild says talks with the AMPTP on this issue went nowhere, though the studios offered to host “annual meetings to discuss advancements in technology.”The WGA released a long and detailed list of what writers can’t do when a strike begins, including write for or deliver scripts and negotiate or discuss projects. They’re required to request the return of spec scripts, tell their agents not to negotiate for them, honor picket lines and tell the WGA of any strikebreaking activity.The Directors Guild and the Screen Actors Guild each have contracts that expire June 30. DGA members support the strike but have a “no-strike” clause in their own contract that requires them to still come to work and cross a picket line, even if other guilds go on strike. The Teamsters have said that they will not cross picket lines. Also supporting the strike are IATSE, SAG-AFTRA, and the Art Directors Guild.Writers will point to soaring executive pay, massive investments, content spending, production budgets, and annual profits and say: Why aren’t we seeing that money? The massive corporations have their challenges: For Disney, Paramount, and Warner Bros. Discovery, their flagship streaming services aren’t yet profitable despite the years they’ve spent chasing subscribers. Disney is in the midst of laying off 7,000 employees, and they’re following other hundreds or thousands of layoffs and re-organizations from their rivals. Streamers like Netflix and Amazon are tightening their belts and not increasing their content spending; the global box office is still far below its pre-pandemic performance.So maybe now is not the ideal time to be fighting for money, but as the guild has learned through painful experience: It never is.",

        "title": "‘Land of Gold’ Review: This Clunky but Affecting Road Movie Unfolds Like a Real-Life Riff on ‘The Last of Us’",
        "content": "A clunky but poignant drama that was made with the support of AT&T and the Tribeca Festival, Nardeep Khurmi’s “Land of Gold” effectively distills the post-apocalyptic horrors of “The Last of Us” into a road movie about two brown Americans trying to survive the long drive across today’s United States.Instead of traveling West from Boston to Salt Lake City, our reluctant Punjabi hero and his precocious Latina stowaway make their way East from California to Maine; instead of zombified fungus monsters who hunger for human flesh, the film’s surrogate father-daughter duo are forced to navigate 3,000 equally dangerous miles of overeager ICE agents and suspicious white convenience store clerks.If contrived plotting and clumsy dialogue leave Khurmi’s quasi-neorealist debut feeling almost as fanciful as HBO’s mushroom holocaust, the bond that it forges between a truck driver and his human cargo is held together by a rich tapestry of well-worn truths. Both of these first-generation immigrants were brought to this country by parents who were promised a better life for their children, and both of them have come to feel betrayed by the shared dream they inherited like a destiny.In the face of a hostile and uncertain world, these two strangers may be the only people capable of restoring each other’s faith in the future; what they ultimately offer each other rings hollow, but their mutual need for it bleeds right off the screen.In stark contrast to the grieving father whose long-ago loss drives the story of “The Last of Us,” Kiran Singh (played by Khurmi himself) is an imminent father-to-be whose fear of the future — specifically that of repeating his own dad’s mistakes — has caused him to disengage from his daughter before she’s even born. Despite promising his very pregnant wife (Pallavi Sastry as Preeti) that he wouldn’t take on any more trucking jobs until after the baby is born, Kiran jumps at the first chance he gets to stick his wife with his traditional Sikh mother (Riti Sachdeva) and haul some random stuff across the country before “it” arrives.Is it true that he needs the money? The trappings of a comfortably middle-class lifestyle would suggest otherwise, but there’s no such thing as financial peace of mind for someone who was raised in the shadow of their parents’ hardships. Besides, Kiran can smoke in his truck, and the open road is the perfect place for a man on the cusp of fatherhood to reflect on the pressures he might be about to pass down. Kiran’s father once beamed that “the whole world will be yours, and I will give it to you,” and now — with his old man (Iqbal Theba) confined to flashbacks — Kiran feels the weight of that world falling squarely atop his shoulders. One generation’s brightest hopes become the next generation’s heaviest burdens.&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;span data-mce-type=&#8221;bookmark&#8221; style=&#8221;display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;&#8221; class=&#8221;mce_SELRES_start&#8221;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&#65279;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;In that light, it often works to the film’s advantage that Khurmi’s heartfelt but high-strung lead performance burns with the ultra-specific desperation of someone trying to will his first movie together, even if Kiran steers through a handful of key moments with a clenched distress that undercuts their drama. Less helpful is that Khurmi’s overwritten script distrusts its audience to read between the lines, as many of the scenes between Kiran and his pint-sized passenger are choked with petulant banter that squeezes the life out of both characters.“Land of Gold” is hardly 10 minutes old before Kinan discovers a dehydrated pre-teen girl named Elena (Caroline Valencia) hiding in the cargo hold of his truck, and the conflict binding them together is contrived from the start. The first thing Kiran does is to drag the girl to an Arizona police station — he correctly assumes she’s undocumented, but also doesn’t even seem to care about his own daughter — only to think twice when they arrive at the exact moment some cops are cruelly hauling another immigrant inside. After that, he resigns to drive Elena to her uncle’s house in Maine, taking the fast-talking 10-year-old at her word that her parents are at peace with it. Maybe Kiran shouldn’t have kids after all.His decision proves to be a potentially fatal mistake, both for these characters and the film around them. Obscuring Elena’s actual circumstances makes it difficult to believe the reality of the montage-driven bond that she forms with her scraggly new chauffeur, and the rare moments when Khurmi chooses to pump the brakes are so over-inflated with dramatic purpose that watching them borders on rubber-necking.For a film that proves effective at tracing the ambient tensions of moving through America as a person of color, it’s frustrating that “Land of Gold” takes every shortcut it can find along its eastward route. Even touching detours — such as the sequence when Kiran and Elena pause to compare their religious faiths at an Oklahoma truck stop, and to note the historic connection between the Mexican American and Punjabi American communities — suffer from a tendency to reverse-engineer each scene from a teachable moment, as if Khurmi had envisioned his script through the wrong end of the small telescope that Kiran carries with him wherever he goes.But the most frustrating thing about Kiran’s choice is the gradual realization that “Land of Gold” would have been a richer and more powerful film if Khurmi hadn’t pressured its everyday tragedies into an over-plotted melodrama. While Kiran may worship the infinite, Khurmi denies him the chance to explore it. Rather than confront his powerlessness to help Elena — and use it as a lens through which Kiran might forgive his own father’s failure to give his family the future he promised them — “Land of Gold” muddies its message by speeding towards a third act filled with new characters, surprising reveals, and devastating heartaches. This story begs for a dash of the poetic neorealism captured by the phosphorus glow of Christopher Low’s digital cinematography (I half-expected its characters to make a pitstop in Paris, Texas), but its telling errs closer to the gloss of network TV.And yet, given the nature of Kiran’s neuroses, it’s easy to forgive “Land of Gold” for trying to do too much with the opportunity at its disposal. Few debut features brim with such feeling, and even fewer reflect such an urgent need to solve a lifetime of inherited trauma in the span of a single film, as if their director may never get a second chance. The bittersweet final moments of this first movie, in which “Land of Gold” elegantly reconciles the hopes that Kiran has for his daughter with the heartache that he received from his parents, find Khurmi making the most of a chance several generations in the making.“Land of Gold” opens in limited release on Friday, May 5, before streaming on Max on Friday, May 12.",

        "content": "Ready, set, race.The PlayStation video game franchise “Gran Turismo” inspired the real-life story of Jann Mardenborough, a young teenager who began a racing career. Now, director Neill Blomkamp (“District 9”) is bringing that story to the big screen.“Gran Turismo” stars Archie Madekwe as the aforementioned teen who aspires to become a professional race car driver with the help of his trainer (David Harbour) and a motorsport marketing executive (Orlando Bloom). Djimon Hounsou portrays Mardenborough’s father, while Darren Barnet plays a GT Academy driver threatened by his new opponent.“Top Gun: Maverick” director Joseph Kosinski was originally set to helm the feature in 2015. Also that same year, Blomkamp was attached to a fifth “Alien” film starring Sigourney Weaver.The “Gran Turismo” video game is a racing simulation from developer Polyphony Digital, led by Kazunori Yamauchi. The original game featured recreations of real-life vehicles and spurred a 14-installment franchise that became one of the highest-selling video game series for Sony PlayStation.Jason Hall and Zach Baylin penned the screenplay, with Asad Qizilbash, Carter Swan, Doug Belgrad and Dana Brunetti producing the film through Columbia Pictures, PlayStation Productions, Trigger Street Productions and 2.0 Entertainment. “Gran Turismo” is a Sony Pictures release.Meanwhile, director Blomkamp’s films have seen varying success since “District 9” earned Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, and Best Visual Effects Oscar nominations in 2010. His sci-fi features since have included “Elysium” and “Chappie,” plus the horror film “Demonic.”As of late 2021, the South African writer-director did confirm that a “District 9” sequel was well into the writing stage. The film’s star, Sharlto Copley, said in an early 2022 IndieWire interview, “I’ve wanted to do it since we did the first one. It was really Neill coming round with sort of where the world’s been going. And feeling like he has something to say again. We’ve been throwing drafts back and forth and hopefully getting close to something that we can make that will have some relevance.”“Gran Turismo” premieres August 11 in theaters.

        "title": "Will Disney Win Against DeSantis? The Florida Lawsuit Explained",
        "content": "The five most famous words ever said at Walt Disney World in Florida? “Well, I’m not a crook.”Yep, Richard Nixon’s infamously defensive November 17, 1973 press conference denying the Watergate scandal took place not at the White House but at the Happiest Place on Earth. Such was the president’s Disney fandom — an obsession with Mickey & Co. that many American conservatives shared for decades. Florida governor Ron DeSantis even got married at Disney World.How times have changed.Disney is now Public Enemy No. 1 for DeSantis. The governor commandeered the longstanding special administrative zone (the Reedy Creek Improvement District) that allows Walt Disney World to self-govern by appointing his own board of directors to lead it; Disney countered with some “Game of Thrones”-style legal jujitsu to prevent that new board from changing anything. DeSantis then threatened more legislative combativeness, and finally Disney filed a lawsuit with the U.S. Court for the Northern District of Florida alleging retaliation by the governor and illegal voiding of contracts, asking for a return to the status quo. Then DeSantis’s handpicked board he’d installed to take over Reedy Creek filed a countersuit in state court.So can Disney win over DeSantis?IndieWire spoke to three experts: Jacob Schumer, a land-use attorney specializing in local government affairs based in the Orlando suburbs; political science professor Aubrey Jewett, who is an assistant director at the School of Politics, Security, and International Affairs at the University of Central Florida; and First Amendment scholar and law professor RonNell Andersen Jones at the University of Utah. They broke down the winnability of Disney’s lawsuit against the Florida governor, piece by piece, starting at the beginning.Disney advocated for the creation of the Reedy Creek Improvement District to be created in 1967 so that the company could set its own building codes and standards, and could tax itself to enable the development of its 25,000 acres (39 sq. miles) of land it had purchased for the “Florida Project.” Instead of paying taxes to the state government, and the state building roads and infrastructure, Disney could distribute the tax money it acquired from itself for its developments.And that’s what happened. The tax revenue didn’t go to the state itself (although Disney also pays taxes to the Orange and Osceola counties over which its property stretches — essentially, being double taxed), but the company developed its land to higher standards than the state government could have achieved.Schumer: Reedy Creek’s taxing power is three times higher than cities and counties. It has humongous taxing power. No other special district comes anywhere close to it. And that taxing power was used to build very nice roads and very nice facilities that otherwise a government wouldn’t spend the extra money on.Plenty of people would say it’s an unfair advantage, but other people would say — look, it worked extremely well. So an unfair advantage it may be, [but] maybe you should give it to other companies. Maybe you should let Universal Studios do this as well.Jewett: Reedy Creek is/was different than any other special district in Florida in terms of the broad variety of power they were given. Now most of the powers that they were given can be found in other Florida special districts (flood control, water, utilities, fire protection, waste disposal, roads, etc), but not usually combined — and some that I don’t think exist anywhere else in Florida.Reedy Creek being able to assume functions of government to provide basic infrastructure and spur economic development resulted in an economic engine for Orlando and Central Florida, directly creating 75,000 jobs on the property itself. It’s also maintained high standards.Jewett: I think two things are often missed by critics of Reedy Creek. First, state and local governments often give businesses huge incentives to move to their area or expand in their area. Think about the massive breaks given car manufacturers or high tech businesses (FL has given huge breaks to numerous bio tech firms). So in comparison to those kinds of deals, the Disney Reedy Creek deal does not look so out of the ordinary.When Disney came to Florida in the 1960s enormous amounts of money were going to have to be spent to develop the land. That money could either come from taxpayers or from Disney; setting up Reedy Creek allowed that money to come from Disney through the bonds they issued and repaid. Disney has more than held up its end of the deal: putting Orlando and Florida on the map, attracting millions of visitors, paying billions in taxes, creating tens of thousands of jobs directly and tens of thousands more indirectly. And [it] created billions of dollars of economic activity both directly from their operations and many more billions indirectly for all the hotels, restaurants, and retails outlets who benefit from spending by people coming to visit Disney.Second, while Reedy Creed is qualitatively different than other Florida special districts (there are about 1,950 of them currently), it is not completely unique. In fact, the fastest growing type of special district in FL (and most numerous, with more than 900 of them) is the Community Development District. And these CDDs are quite similar in broad framework to Reedy Creek. So bottom line, Florida does allow lots of “private” governments in Florida designed to create and operate new developments and they are run by property owners — this in essence is what Reedy Creek does, or did.Schumer: You hear a private company gets to write their own codes [and think] they’re going to be super lax. Actually, Disney made their codes really strict. It’s harder to get permits in the district than it is in Orange or Osceola County. It’s because Disney is an organization that’s so concerned about its perception and quality… they built very good parks, they build high-quality roads, and they build a high-quality monorail. People tend to be much safer there than in ordinary places.Disney drew DeSantis’s ire by withdrawing all political spending in Florida after Florida Republicans introduced the “Don’t Say Gay” bill in early 2022 the company then came out in opposition to the bill itself. Disney’s lawsuit against DeSantis alleges retaliation spurred by Disney’s opposition to the state’s anti-LGBTQ policies.Andersen Jones: This case is an assertion of freedom of corporate speech. It was not always universally recognized that corporations had First Amendment rights that paralleled those of individual people. This doctrine came about primarily as a result of a concerted conservative push for it, and it was conservative justices who expanded the ability of corporations to argue that they enjoy freedom of speech. This is a bit of a plot twist, with the corporate free speech being asserted in a suit that is contrary to, rather than advancing, that conservative agenda.Jewett: According to the United States Supreme Court, corporations have free speech rights and conservatives have usually agreed with this interpretation and pushed for it — this was the crux of the 2010 Citizens United decisions allowing corporations to spend money on independent expenditure campaigns (basically, the court linked money and speech, which was controversial, but the underlying premise was less controversial — that corporations have free speech rights).Free speech does not go away just because the state (or federal or local) government does not like the speech — in fact, the courts have held numerous times that objectional speech is when free speech rights are most important. One example that I use to “balance the scales” between liberals and conservatives is the case of Chik-fil-A where several progressive local governments have taken action over the years to try and stop new locations from opening because they think Chik-fil-A has not been supportive of (or directly opposed to) LGBTQ rights like gay marriage. As a political science professor who highly values free speech, I tell my students it is not right for governments to try and punish companies for exercising their free speech rights, regardless of whether it is conservative or liberal.Schumer: No. The reason why they couldn’t dissolve the district like they originally planned is that they had outstanding bonds [Disney had long ago paid to Florida] and the state government can’t dissolve a district without paying those off. And so they didn’t want to pay billions of dollars of Disney’s debt immediately.Instead, DeSantis appointed his own board members to run Reedy Creek. Which is not the same as putting Disney on an equal footing with other companies and theme parks.It went from being unequal in one way [in favor to Disney] to unequal in the other way. Because the equal footing with other theme parks would be no district at all. Not political appointees in control of the district.Jewett: In between attacking Disney for speaking out against the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, DeSantis has also occasionally said that it is about leveling the playing field and treating Disney equally. But that is not what the state has done. No other company in Florida that I know has a local government board selected by the governor where the board and governor have threatened the company and set up a system where they have leverage to damage that company. DeSantis and some members of the board have directly and indirectly indicated that they want Disney to change its behavior (for instance, to stop speaking out on “woke” issues and to curtail diversity within its programming and movies) and that they might or will use their power over taxing, spending, services and future development to punish Disney if Disney does not comply.As one specific example, DeSantis has said the state will take away the power of Disney to conduct their own pool and ride inspections, but leave those powers with competitors like Sea World and Universal. Overall, Disney is not being treated equally; it is being treated much worse. That is the heart of the 14th Amendment complaints alleged by Disney — that the state and board are not giving Disney equal protection and due process under the law.No, Disney can’t move out of Florida, and anyone wondering that has clearly never set foot in Walt Disney World. The property has four sprawling theme parks, two water parks, an entertainment district, and 31 themed resort hotels. It’d be like asking the Las Vegas Strip to pack up and move elsewhere. Walt Disney World is the most visited vacation destination in the world, with an average attendance of 58 million visitors a year — part of why the Parks unit is the biggest revenue stream for the Walt Disney Co.Jewett: At this moment, we do not know which judge will hear the case, [though chief judge Mark Walker oversees the district]. I think it does matter somewhat who hears the case, although it shouldn’t and might not since both liberal and conservative judges have frequently been supportive of free speech rights.[This weekend, a judge from the U.S. Court for the Northern District of Florida, Martin Fitzpatrick, declared that he recused himself for consideration — but he hadn’t been assigned to the case.]Jewett: Regardless of what the trial court decides, whoever loses will likely appeal and the federal appeals court for Florida has more conservatives than liberals. Whoever loses at federal appeals level may appeal to the US Supreme Court, where there are also more conservative appointees than liberals.Schumer: [Fitzpatrick’s recusal] caused confusion because ordinary people really don’t need to concern themselves with knowing about stuff like this. The case still ultimately falls under chief judge Mark Walker. If he chooses to hear it himself, he is exactly the Judge Disney would want on this. Judge Walker has not been concerned, has not been hesitant, to issue scathing rulings against the DeSantis administration for free-speech violations. [Walker struck down DeSantis’s “Stop Woke” Act in November.]Schumer: The case that it was DeSantis’s retaliation in response to protected speech is rock solid. There’s no way that the state can get around that part because of all the public statements DeSantis and legislators have made [including what Republican state representative Randy Fine said when he introduced the bill to dissolve the special district: “This bill does target one company: it targets the Walt Disney Company”] and the timing, and a million other things. The governor and the legislature put in bright lights, they lit it up in a billboard, saying this is retaliation and retaliation specifically for protected speech, which is prohibited under the First Amendment.Then it’s a matter of what the courts feel that they can do about it. If they think that they can go back and say, yeah, the whole takeover is illegal, and put Disney’s people back in on the board [removing DeSantis’s appointments], I think that’s the most likely outcome. What can DeSantis’s board members do in the meantime, though?Andersen Jones: First Amendment doctrine makes clear that it is unconstitutional when government retaliates for speech or expressive positions. Disney’s claim is that DeSantis was not subtle — that he almost directly said that he was taking his actions to punish the company for its expressive positions. If Disney can prove that, it isn’t perfectly relevant that the position it lost was a privileged one that others didn’t have. The question is whether government’s actions — of whatever sort — were punishment for expression.Schumer: One compromise that might make everybody happy and might actually be consistent with equality is replacing the governor-appointed board with Orange and Osceola County appointees. Then you get something more like equality because it’s local control as opposed to political-appointee control. But settlement seems far away at this point because settlement means the governor worked with Disney. But if there is one, that’s my guess at what a settlement would look like.Jewett: Ultimately the federal court battle will be more important. If Disney wins what they want in federal court, then the state court battle will become largely moot (because the law getting rid of Reedy Creek will be voided and this new board will be gone). However, if Disney loses in federal court then the state court battle takes on added significance because then the state court decision will determine whether the development agreement is valid (and Disney still gets to have a lot of control) or whether it is invalid and the new board will have Disney under its control.Schumer: I think they have a very good chance of winning the retaliation aspect of the suit. They also just want a return to the status quo. I don’t think they’re looking for damages and I don’t think they want them.Jewett: Yes, Disney has a chance of winning. Like any court battle there is no guarantee, but the lawsuit brings up serious constitutional questions and provides the outline of the evidence for the charges that seem pretty clear and factual on the surface. Despite what Governor DeSantis has said, the lawsuit is not just political.Andersen Jones: Yes, Disney has a quite robust claim here.",

        "content": "Emma Watson is admitting that she “wasn’t very happy” during the height of her career.The “Harry Potter” alum, who began acting at age 10, has not appeared onscreen since 2019’s “Little Women” directed by Greta Gerwig. Watson opened up about feeling “caged” in her career in a new interview with Financial Times.“I wasn’t very happy, if I’m being honest,” Watson said. “I think I felt a bit caged. The thing I found really hard was that I had to go out and sell something that I really didn’t have very much control over. To stand in front of a film and have every journalist be able to say, ‘How does this align with your viewpoint?’ It was very difficult to have to be the face and the spokesperson for things where I didn’t get to be involved in the process.”Watson continued, “I was held accountable in a way that I began to find really frustrating, because I didn’t have a voice, I didn’t have a say. And I started to realize that I only wanted to stand in front of things where if someone was going to give me flak about it, I could say, in a way that didn’t make me hate myself, ‘Yes, I screwed up, it was my decision, I should have done better.'”Instead, Watson pursued her seemingly “unattainable” dream of directing. She wrote and directed a Prada campaign and is next set to helm a music video for a male artist whom she has not named.“People always told me I should direct and produce, even when I was on ‘Potter,'” Watson said. “I was worried it was just technical, not creative, and I couldn’t bring what I think is probably my skill set. It was only [my brother] Alex coming to me with this, and friends asking for favors – ‘I need to do a photo shoot’ or ‘I’m making a video’ – that made me realize I actually know quite a lot about that. Being a director seemed unattainable. I don’t think I had any confidence in that. I know it seems weird. I mean, I grew up on a film set.”Last month, Watson opened up on Instagram in a rare personal post about how she “stepped away from my life” as she pivots away from acting.Watson also is starting a MA program in creative writing at Oxford University. She is confirmed to be starring in a film set for an early 2024 production and assured that “yes, absolutely” she will return to acting for good.“But I’m happy to sit and wait for the next right thing,” Watson added. “I love what I do. It’s finding a way to do it where I don’t have to fracture myself into different faces and people. And I just don’t want to switch into robot mode any more. Does that make sense?”",

        "content": "“Nomadland” director Chloé Zhao has landed two heavy hitters for her next film, “Hamnet,” set up at Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Partners. Oscar nominees Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal are both in talks to star in the film, an individual with knowledge of the project told IndieWire.“Hamnet” is a historical fiction take on the Bard, William Shakespeare, that tells the story of his wife Anne “Agnes” Hathaway and her romance with the man who would become the world’s most famous playwright. The novel focuses on the death of the couple’s son, Hamnet, who died at age 11 in 1596 and has been speculated to be an inspiration for Shakespeare’s play “Hamlet.”Specific character details for Buckley and Mescal were not disclosed.“Hamnet” is based on a New York Times-best-selling novel from 2020 by author Maggie O’Farrell. Zhao is co-writing the script with O’Farrell.Liza Marshall through Hera Pictures and Pippa Harris, and Sam Mendes via Neal Street Productions are producing the film. Nic Gonda (“The Tree of Life,” “Knight of Cups”) is executive producing on behalf of his banner Book of Shadows. Jeb Brody, Amblin’s President of Production, and Mia Maniscalco, SVP Creative Affairs, will oversee the project on behalf of the studio.Mescal was recently nominated for an Oscar for his work on last year’s “Aftersun,” and he has become one of the most in-demand actors in town, set to star in Ridley Scott’s “Gladiator” sequel, in Richard Linklater’s “Merrily We Roll Along” and in Gareth Evans’ “Foe” alongside Saoirse Ronan. Some of his other recent credits include “Carmen,” “God’s Creatures,” and his breakout series role “Normal People.” And he previously appeared with Buckley in the drama “The Lost Daughter” starring Olivia Colman.Buckley has nearly been just as in demand after she was Oscar-nominated for “The Lost Daughter” and following her breakout work in “Wild Rose.” She’s next meant to star in the sci-fi “Fingernails” for director Christos Nikou and alongside Riz Ahmed, as well as “Wicked Little Letters,” which will reunite her with Olivia Colman. Some of her other credits include the acclaimed “Women Talking” and “I’m Thinking of Ending Things.”Buckley is represented by United Agents, CAA, Relevant and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole. Mescal is represented by CAA and the Curtis Brown Group.Deadline first reported the news of the casting.",

        "title": "‘May December’ First Look: Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore Face Off in Todd Haynes’ Drama",
        "content": "In advance of its Cannes premiere later this month, Todd Haynes’ latest film, “May December,” has released a first look at the new drama (via Variety).The film, Haynes’ 10th feature, follows a pair of women (Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore) whose personal and professional lives begin to blur as they work together during the fraught production of a ripped-from-the-headlines love affair. Working from a Black List-touted script by Samy Burch with a story by Burch and Alex Mechanik, “May December” centers on a married couple whose lives begin to buckle under pressure when an actress arrives to do research for a movie about their past — including the couple’s notorious May-December tabloid romance that once gripped the nation.Per its official synopsis, the film is set “20 years after their notorious tabloid romance gripped the nation, Gracie Atherton-Yu and her husband Joe (23 years her junior) brace themselves for their twins to graduate from high school. When Hollywood actress Elizabeth Berry comes to spend time with the family to better understand Gracie, who she will be playing in a film, family dynamics unravel under the pressure of the outside gaze. Joe, never having processed what happened in his youth, starts to confront the reality of life as an empty-nester at 36.”Haynes regular Moore (who previously collaborated with the filmmaker on “Safe,” “Wonderstruck,” and “Far from Heaven”) stars as the female half of the original couple (with Charles Melton on board as her husband), with Portman (who joins Haynes for the first time) playing the movie version of her. Piper Curda, Elizabeth Yu, and Gabriel Chung round out the cast as Moore and Melton’s children, who are central to the story as well.In the first look at the film, Portman and Moore face off, as Moore’s Gracie seems to be going about her normal day, as a studious Elizabeth appears to be taking copious notes on the minutiae of Gracie’s life (her makeup routine!). And, yes, things are already looking to be going a bit off the rails. Drama!The film shot in Georgia, and wrapped in November. Christopher Blauvelt is the film’s director of photography, with the rest of the creative team rounded out with production designer Sam Lisenco, editor Affonso Gonçalves, costume designer April Napier, and casting director Laura Rosenthal.“May/December” will premiere at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival later this month.",

        "title": "Vin Diesel Goes Way, Way Off Script and 6 Other Things You May Have Missed at CinemaCon 2023",
        "content": "CinemaCon 2023 is a wrap, and while we covered a whole lot of movie reveals, some stuff just didn’t make the edit. Well, consider this story the director’s cut: Your IndieWire auteurs have seven (more) things you may have missed from Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.CinemaCon refuses to believe the hype: “Movie stars” are alive and well and in Las Vegas. Gracing the Colosseum stage for Universal Picture were Will Ferrell (“Strays”), Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake (“Trolls 3”), Jack Black (“Kung Fu Panda 4”), and Vin Diesel (“Fast X”). Warner Bros. Discovery had “Barbie” stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, Timothée Chalamet for both “Wonka” and “Dune: Part Two,” Zendaya for the “Dune” sequel, and Oprah Winfrey for “The Color Purple,” alongside her cast and director. (Not in the house was Ezra Miller, star of “The Flash.”)Sony had Will Smith and Martin Lawrence plugging “Bad Boys 4” via video, which was was probably the right choice, with in-person wattage provided by Denzel Washington and Jennifer Lawrence. Paramount brought Seth Rogen (“TMNT”), Rihanna (“The Smurfs”), and John Krasinski (“IF”); Lionsgate had Oscar-nominee Stephanie Hsu along with the rest of the “Joy Ride” cast and filmmakers.Disney only had Melissa McCarthy, who was at CinemaCon anyway to accept an award (like Denzel).We have to talk more about Vin Diesel; lord knows he talked enough. The “Fast X” star took. his. time. on stage Wednesday, wearing full-body, all-white “X” motorcycle leathers  And it got weirder from there.“I look out and I see soldiers on the front lines,” said a very slow-talking Diesel, describing the theater owners in attendance. “What would society be like if we didn’t have the place called the movie theater?”“I like this room better than the Oscars,” he said. (Diesel has never been nominated for an Academy Award, although he has been nominated for one Razzie, two Stinkers, and a bunch of Teen Choice Awards. He received the Action Star of the Year Award at CinemaCon 2011.)From there his speech went on and on, and left, right, and every other direction — especially south. To be fair to Diesel, his decision to forgo the teleprompter (“You guys don’t give a shit about the teleprompter!”) and go full-on extemporaneous charmed at least some of the audience while confusing others and making things pretty giggly and uncomfortable in the designated press section.Grabbing the biggest laughs from center stage this week were Ferrell (and the dog he voices for in live-action R-rated comedy “Strays”), Rogen, and Gosling, probably in that order. In all the teasers and trailers, footage from J-Law’s raunchy Sony comedy “No Hard Feelings” got the biggest on-screen laughs.Paramount domestic distribution president Chris Aronson also got points for his parodic reading of Nicole Kidman’s (in)famous AMC Theatres spot, but he had the audience smiling from the moment he emerged from a manhole cover stage left to celebrate “Turtles.” Quipped the film‘s producer Rogen: “Not the first time I’ve seen a studio executive emerge from the sewers.”In 2022, the great post-pandemic return to CinemaCon turned the event into one big pep rally. Last year the energy in the room felt like everyone wanted — and needed — cheerleading. This year there was a quiet confidence: More chill, less chanting.If the fear has left Las Vegas, the loathing for shortened theatrical windows remains intact. There were more than a few mentions of “Avatar: The Way of Water,” and “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” and “Smile,” and every other movie that performed better than expected in theaters (don’t forget the ones that were made for streaming, as we were frequently reminded).The box office still isn’t back to pre-pandemic levels and probably won’t make it there by the end of 2023, but there’s evidence that theaters still matter. This year, when folks on stage said the death of their business has been greatly exaggerated, we believed them.“This industry has been pronounced dead a number of times… every time they’ve been wrong,” said outgoing National Association of Theater Owners president John Fithian in a press conference following his keynote. “Our epitaph has been written many times… people come back, and they come back in growing numbers.”With movies to put in theaters and the exposure of streamers’ limitations, everyone felt good about the business. Still, Amazon and Apple were among the talks — and toasts — of the town.Footage from Apple movies “Killers of the Flower Moon” and “Napoleon” were here via distributors Paramount and Sony, respectively (both looked really good on the big screen). And a primary talking point in the State of the Industry keynote was Apple and Amazon “announcing” $1 billion commitments to theatrical.But here’s the thing: Neither company actually announced that. Those assumptions came from separate Bloomberg stories citing anonymous insider sources.That said, one media-industry analyst we spoke with on the ground believes the two tech companies will be what finally brings the industry back to its pre-Covid release tallies. An exhibitor we spoke with even feels more positive about what Apple and Amazon’s plans than what’s been reported.We asked Fithian about Amazon and Apple in a press conference that followed his keynote speech. He pointed us to an interview Amazon Studios chief Jen Salke gave to the New York Times about their commitment, and he pointed to Apple simply having two movies screening footage, not to mention Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio being here to promote it (more on those two in a moment).And, he repeated information we heard all week that movies that get a theatrical window first perform better when they hit streaming. Still, there’s no clarity on what it means for windowing or how many movies they might push in the future.“[Salke] made it very clear in that article this is not just a one-off test balloon in this space. That is consistent with conversations we’ve had with Amazon these last several years,” Fithian said. And he lamented that he seems to get questions every year about windows.“There’s no one-size-fits-all answer. There never has been,” he said. “Windows calculations are all over the map, and the good news is those decisions are being made between the studios and the exhibitors now… it’s a partnership and a discussion between individual studios and the distributors. Charlie [Rivkin] and I certainly can’t tell what the windows will be.”One final update about everyone here and streamers: They all still hate Netflix.Fithian got a hero’s send off at CinemaCon 2023. The well-liked president and CEO of NATO had a shoutout from each studio and sponsor, and made no fewer than three speeches from the top of the coffee table from a private party we attended in the Nobu Tower Suites. There, we also met the incoming Michael O’Leary; we believe the industry to (still) be in good hands. (The man loves “The Wire” — he’s cool with us.)On the receiving end of seemingly as many tributes was the late, great Erik Lomis. He was most recently an evangelist for putting Amazon’s “Air” into theaters and was instrumental in pushing “Creed III” to above $270 million worldwide. Read IndieWire’s tribute to Lomis here.When Martin Scorsese received The Cinema Foundation’s inaugural Legend of Cinema award (which will now be named the Martin Scorsese Legend of Cinema award), his speech called out theater owners to find ways to include smaller independent films on their multiplex screens. It would be an “investment,” Scorsese said, in the long-term health and love of cinema, saying that the kids who are attracted to those films today could make the blockbusters of the future.The Thursday luncheon also included a conversation between the director and his “Killers of the Flower Moon”star Leonardo DiCaprio in which Scorsese discussed some of his influences on his new film, hinting that they included Howard Hawks’ “Red River” and William Wyler’s “The Heiress.”",

        "title": "‘Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes’ Trailer Kills at CinemaCon",
        "content": "The odds were ever in the favor of the crowd at CinemaCon, which was treated to the first trailer for “The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.” The upcoming prequel film delves into the history of how the games as we’ve come to know them got their start. The first look was a fitting conclusion to a long week in Vegas.It’s been a busy week at CinemaCon, with every major studio attempting to generate hype for its upcoming slate of blockbusters. Highlights so far include a buzzy new trailer for “Oppenheimer,” which debuted alongside new footage from “Barbie,” “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” and “Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning — Part I.”But in Lionsgate’s presentation on Thursday afternoon, audiences finally understood just how Lionsgate intends to revitalize one of their flagship franchises. The trailer prominently features its adult cast of Viola Davis dressed in the wildest Panem garb, Peter Dinklage in full Tyrion Lannister menace, and Jason Schwartzman as the ancestor to Cesar Flickerman giving some familiar vibes to the original series of films.The prequel — which is directed by franchise regular Francis Lawrence and written by Suzanne Collins, Michael Lesslie, and Michael Arndt — takes place more than half a century before the events of 2012’s “The Hunger Games.” While the story of Katniss Everdeen began at the 74th annual Hunger Games, “The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” is set during the 10th edition. The prequel promises to fill in gaps in the series’ mythology and offer an origin story for Panem President Coriolanus Snow, who was originally played by Donald Sutherland.Tom Blyth stars as an 18-year-old version of Snow, then a veteran of the dystopian sporting event who is tasked with mentoring Lucy Gray, a young District 12 tribute played by Rachel Zegler. More specifically, the trailer shows that though this is not the first Hunger Games or Reaping, it is the first time that the Games are becoming an “event” and sensationalized television. The trailer has the look of vintage Panem but also shows more old fashioned, tube televisions and other retro technology. Even the arena where the Hunger Games take place is not some sprawling, exotic landscape but a far smaller room with just a few obstacles. And Snow is hardly the villain but a hunk (yes, he’s briefly shirtless in the trailer) who eventually becomes complicit in the Capitol’s games.“Do you hear that? It’s the sound of snow…falling,” Dinklage’s character says to Snow in the trailer.Per Lionsgate’s official synopsis, after Lucy Gray commands all of Panem’s attention by defiantly singing during the reaping ceremony, Snow thinks he might be able to turn the odds in their favor. Uniting their instincts for showmanship and newfound political savvy, Snow and Lucy’s race against time to survive will ultimately reveal who is a songbird, and who is a snake.In addition to Zegler and Blyth, “The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” stars Viola Davis, Peter Dinklage, Jason Schwartzman, Hunter Schafer, Burn Gorman, and Fionnula Flanagan.“The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” was first announced at last year’s CinemaCon, with Lionsgate expressing hope that a rebooted “Hunger Games” series could provide the IP-deprived company with another popular franchise to pair with its “John Wick” series.“The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” is set to open in theaters on Friday, November 17. Watch the trailer below.",

        "title": "When Anna Camp Said ‘No’ to Being a ‘Pitch Perfect’ Overachiever, Everything Changed",
        "content": "Anna Camp spent the last few years doing something sort of crazy for an actress who loves to work: saying no.When “Pitch Perfect 3” hit theaters in December 2017, it marked the (maybe) end of the franchise with which Camp is still most closely associated. The half-billion dollar juggernaut about an all-female group of a cappella singers charmed audiences and thrust winsome mashups (Jessie J and Simple Minds?) into the cultural zeitgeist. It also gave Camp and her co-stars Anna Kendrick, Brittany Snow, and Rebel Wilson the roles that made their careers.But, as often happens, the series’ popularity threatened to typecast Camp. Her inbox flooded with offers for other type-A achievers, just like her “Pitch Perfect” part Aubrey Posen — a character so uptight that we first meet her as she pukes her guts out during a particularly stressful competition.That was enough to make Camp nearly quit the industry. Her extensive resume ranges from recurring roles on “True Blood”and “The Mindy Project” to starring opposite Daniel Radcliffe in the Broadway production of “Equus.” She wanted to be challenged — she knew what it meant to be challenged — even if that meant moving to Montana and raising puppies instead (no, really).Camp stars in and produces her latest project, Shudder original “From Black,” and it shows why she’s fought so hard to do her own thing. (Other producing projects in the works: a thriller she likens to “‘Succession’ in the wilderness,” plus two TV series.) This is an actress who loves hearing that her part requires nothing less than taking her character “through hell” — Camp plays a former drug addict who undergoes an intense ritual with the express purpose of getting her long-missing young son back, so the “hell” here is more than a metaphor — and can’t wait to say yes to it.Ahead, Camp reflects on everything from carving her own path to keeping up on her “Pitch Perfect” group chat.The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.IndieWire: This is your first leading role in a horror feature, though many people remember you for your work on “True Blood.” Had you been looking for something like this for awhile? Anna Camp: I was definitely looking for something different. Obviously, “Pitch Perfect” is something that opened a lot of doors for me and changed my life in a really incredible way. It also began to kind of push my career into that type of character, and so I was actively searching for and longing for something that was going to show what else I can do, something a bit more dramatic. I’ve been a fan of horror for a really long time, so I was excited to get the chance to play the girl in a horror movie, and especially one that’s so different from a lot of horror movies that I’ve seen.It’s easy to say you want to do something different, but much harder in practice.I’ve been saying no to a lot of things recently in my life, maybe over the past four years, because I kept getting the same part offered to me. There comes a point creatively when I feel like I cannot grow anymore in that specific type of role. I’ve been actively fighting for and searching for things that I will say yes to. That kind of took me away from TV for a while. I’ve been doing a lot of indie films, [and a lot of those roles] are very different from the roles that people have normally seen me in.This role actually came to me, surprisingly enough, through a producer named Kelly Frazier. We worked on a Western film together called “Murder at Yellowstone City,” and she kept texting me about different actresses and what I thought of them, and I was like, “They’re great, they’re great, but wait a minute, what are you doing?” And I don’t know if this was calculated or not, but she was like, “I’m searching for an actress who can play a mother, who can really go through hell and back, and this is a really low-budget film and we’re searching for someone who has the stamina and who had the emotional range and availability to do this.” And I said, “Can you send me the script?”I read it in an hour. I called her up immediately and I said, “I have to play this, how can I play this?” She set me up on a Zoom meeting with Thomas Marchese, who’s the co-writer and director of the movie, and I said, “Listen, I have been dying to play something like this for a really long time, and I know I can kill it, so what can I do for the opportunity to get this?” And he was like, “I believe you, Anna, that you’re hungry for something like this.” And he gave it to me on the spot. So it was a great meeting.This is also the first film you’ve got a producing credit on, and whenever I see those first producing credits for someone, it seems like a strong indication of a passion project. It makes you feel like you have a lot more at stake. It lets you put your own voice [into it]. I feel like, for the longest time, I’ve been going where people tell me to go and waiting for the phone to ring kind of thing, and I was like, no, I’m done doing that. My ideas are valid. My point of view is valid. I’ve been acting for over 20 years in the industry. I have a lot of street cred, hopefully.It was really, really exciting to see the director and the other producers rally around me and ask me my thoughts and ask me questions. I feel like I have a lot more invested in this film. People are going to get to see that this is something that I am passionate about and I’m passionate about telling stories like this that are different and out of the box and interesting and surprising, and they don’t have to include dancing and singing all the time.As you mentioned, you’ve been doing a lot of indie features lately, from “From Black” to “A Little Prayer,” which was just at Sundance. What attracts you to these kinds of projects? These are smaller, more relatable stories. I think that the directors that I’ve been working with are willing to cast me outside of the box. [That] has been really exciting, that they see something in me or in my previous work that they’re not afraid to cast this typical type-A character or person, but they see something in me. I would rather fight for something and do something that is a bit more challenging for me always than just do the same thing over and over and over, because I just won’t be creatively inspired.I kept telling my agents years ago when I kept getting offered the same type of things, “I would rather just quit and move to Montana and like, raise puppies.” I would rather switch careers because I just wasn’t creatively inspired anymore. So it’s been very exciting to work with people who see me in a new light. The stories that we’re telling are very human stories, very personal stories, and things that I know a lot of people can relate to, which is what I’m excited about doing.I hear that so often, especially from actresses who are like, “I played a doctor once and all I ever get now are scripts about doctors.”Why does that happen? It’s so frustrating.As you’re crafting this period of your career, is there anyone else’s career that inspires you, that perhaps you’d like to emulate?I have these two actors that, if I could take both of their careers and meld them into one, that is something that I’d want to do. I love Naomi Watts. I love the choices that she makes. I think she’s incredibly talented. I’ve been a fan of her since “Mulholland Drive,” one of my favorite movies ever. So if I could be anything like her, I would be very, very, very grateful and happy.And then on the other side of things, I love Paul Rudd, right? He’s a comedian, and I’ve loved him since “Romeo + Juliet,” when he was playing Paris. If I could meld those two careers together, I would be so lucky. They’re my two inspirations.They’re also both actors who have been in the business for decades and continue to evolve and don’t seem to have an end point.I want to be acting when I’m old and gray and someone’s having to feed me my lines in my little Bluetooth ear[piece], whatever. We’re going to see our lines in our eyes, with contacts that we can have to give us our lines. [Laughs]“Pitch Perfect” is a franchise that still very much has legs. There’s a TV series now. Do you ever see yourself returning to the “Pitch Perfect” fray?100 percent. I would love to do it. Absolutely. It was a really amazing thing to get to play a character over three huge franchise films. That is something that I never even dreamed could happen to me when I was coming up as an actor. It’s such a gift to be able to grow with the character and grow with the castmates. We’ve seen each other through a lot of personal ups and downs. We know each other so well. Elizabeth Banks, I adore. I think she’s phenomenal.I close my eyes and I think about my very first audition for Aubrey and “Pitch Perfect.” I had graduated school. I was doing an off-Broadway play in New York City. I came in, I brought my little ukulele and sang a song and booked the job that basically really changed my entire professional career. So 100 percent, I could go back and see what’s going on with Aubrey these days. I don’t know if the fans would want it, maybe they would want it, I don’t know. Probably they would.I think that they would!A Bella for Life, we say that. We’re Bellas for life.It seemed obvious from the start that you and many of your “Pitch Perfect” co-stars became actually really close friends on screen and off. When did you realize that that was not always the case in Hollywood?Right away, on our first film, we got along so well, that we knew something really special was going on. I had done a couple movies and a couple TV gigs before that, and I only had about three friends that were really close from all of those projects. The rest of the people, you think you’re going to be friends with them forever and you form this very quick bond because you’re shooting on location and you become this family, but then, you go back and time moves on and you lose contact.We still have a group text that we’re on that we check in with each other. That doesn’t happen. That’s only happened on one other job for me, a TV show called “Perfect Harmony.” We’re still on a group chat. It ran just one season, but we check in with each other. It’s so rare to have that. It’s a bond. We’re bonded for life. It’s a very special thing that we all have. I know that all of us don’t take that for granted at all in this business, because people come and go and projects come and go so quickly.Other people might also think it’s rare that so many women can get along, especially in this industry, but I think that we as women know that that’s not the case.When we first came out and we were actually friends, people were so surprised by it. They were like, “Wait, they’re not competing all the time when they’re on set?” And it’s like, “No, we actually like each fill our roles so specifically well, and the people that were all cast were actually really good, lovely people, which also makes a difference.” We’re girlfriends, man. We give each other advice. We give each other tips on things. Hopefully people aren’t as surprised by that anymore.You are also in this period of your career in which projects are being rebooted.I think they were doing a prequel to “True Blood” or something where they were casting younger people. I remember being like, whoa, this is crazy. That’s so many years ago. And as far as I know, Sarah Newlin is still stuck in the basement. I had the very last spoken line of the entire series of “True Blood.” So Sarah Newlin’s still alive down there. I don’t know what she’s doing!It’s exciting to see that there’s still people that care about the characters’ journeys and that care about the town and the things that are happening. It just definitely makes me feel a little old sometimes. I’m on a new show [“Hysteria!” for Peacock) where a lot of the cast are younger, high school students, and I just had my first hair and makeup test literally the other day, and they walked me through the trailer and they put me up in the room and shut the door [away from] the kids, and I was like, “I was the kid!”Now I’m the grande dame who’s getting taken up the stairs. It’s just so fascinating how quickly that happens, because I still feel like I’m 26, you know what I mean? In my soul, I still feel like I’m that, but I’m 40. And it’s just amazing that I’m still working, and hopefully will continue to work till I can’t anymore.What have you not yet done that you really want to do?Oh, so much. I could sit here and talk for 500 hours to answer that question. A bajillion things. I definitely have a bucket-list role. I love theater and I love plays, and I’m still very much wanting to do a Tennessee Williams play. I would love to do “A Streetcar Named Desire.” I’d love to play Blanche DuBois.I want to just continue to work in challenging roles that help me grow and evolve as a person, and never get stuck in one thing. I’m never going to give up. I’m never going to turn around and be like, “I can’t do this.” I’m going to keep fighting for the good roles.“From Black” starts streaming on Shudder on Friday, April 28.",

        "title": "‘Dogville’ at 20: The Cast on ‘Cranky’ Lauren Bacall, Day-Drinking on Set, and the Fun of Being ‘Horrible’",
        "content": "In Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht’s “Pirate Jenny” from “The Threepenny Opera,” a peasant hotel maid avenges herself for the cruelty she suffers from her fellow townspeople by imagining a pirate ship that sweeps into town, flattening the village and everyone in it. So, of course, the Danish king of saintly put-upon martyrs, Lars von Trier, found this material suitable for making a film every bit as alienating to the audience as the works of Brecht: 2003’s “Dogville.” Von Trier also centered his film around a blockbuster movie star, whose under-a-bell-jar image he set upon to deconstruct: Nicole Kidman.Freshly off her Best Actress Oscar win for “The Hours” and also out of her messily public but oddly inscrutable divorce from Tom Cruise, Kidman flew to rural Trollhättan in Sweden to get on a soundstage with a truly there-are-no-words-amazing cast: Paul Bettany, Lauren Bacall, Harriet Andersson, Stellan Skarsgård, Chloë Sevigny, Udo Kier, Ben Gazzara, James Caan, Jeremy Davies, Patricia Clarkson, Philip Baker Hall, and more.They were all there to submit themselves to von Trier’s vision of an honest, hardscrabble townsfolk in middle-of-nowhere Colorado who welcome a kindly woman named Grace Mulligan (Kidman), on the run from her gangster father (Caan), until their largesse turns to disgust and disdain, and they degrade and debase her to a breaking point. Until she decides to take it no longer.Submitting themselves to this production meant leaving their egos at the door and giving the most unvarnished performances of their life: no trailers, no makeup, and not even a set, as “Dogville” takes place entirely on a black stage with chalk outlines where the pieces of a set would be, a white screen thrown up occasionally to represent daytime.The 178-minute epic of pain thus unfolded, as does any film written and directed by the man who flippantly proclaimed himself a Nazi during a press conference at the Cannes Film Festival, with journalists divided or jeering or in outright awe over its performances and Dogme 95-inspired stripped-down style. There was also fervor over its alleged anti-USA message, ascribed to a parable of Americans as the root of all evil who merrily exploit outsiders. (Von Trier has never been to the U.S. and reportedly refuses to fly.)And “Dogville,” to be clear, also features seemingly innumerable moments of sexual assault. Kidman’s character is raped by nearly all the male townspeople and at one point shackled with a ball and chain around her neck, dragging herself across the bare floor, prostrate to von Trier’s Artistic Genius. He was asked by a journalist at Cannes why all his films feature the torture of women. He said it’s because watching men being tortured is boring. Meanwhile, von Trier himself has been accused of mistreating and abusing the women in his own life, including Björk on the set of “Dancer in the Dark” (she swore off acting and then later detailed more harassment from an unnamed filmmaker that’s likely him) and even Kidman on the making of “Dogville.” Yet many of his female collaborators have defended and revered him, from Charlotte Gainsbourg to Kirsten Dunst.Same with Kidman, who ultimately did not return for the film’s sequel, “Manderlay,” less well-received and with Bryce Dallas Howard in her stead. “I didn’t do the sequel but I’m still very good friends with him, strangely enough, because I admire his honesty and I see him as an artist,” Kidman said in a 2006 interview. (She did not respond to IndieWire’s requests to participate in this story.)Regardless of your thoughts on the controversial artist — who is stepping away from prolific filmmaking to deal with Parkinson’s disease — “Dogville” is a towering achievement that deserves a new audience. Its post-theatrical life in the U.S. has been relegated to a standard-definition DVD — unkind to the film, really, as it was shot on digital video. But thankfully, MUBI is re-releasing the film with a brand new 4K restoration on its streaming platform beginning April 14.Tracking down actors who wanted to talk about the film was tricky — several blamed scheduling conflicts or other, newer projects they wanted to promote — but supporting stars Stellan Skarsgård and Chloë Sevigny were happy and willing to look back, fondly, on “Dogville.”Skarsgård, a close friend of von Trier’s and longtime collaborator since “Breaking the Waves,” plays the cynical and eventually monstrous farmer Chuck. Sevigny plays the wily woman of the village, Liz, who doubts Grace’s virtue and eventually helps sell her out to the town’s absolute worst (which is all of them, inevitably). While they both had relatively small roles in the film, their constant presence (literally) behind the major characters meant they still collected plenty of scintillating stories of everything around them, and here they share their thoughts with IndieWire.These interviews were conducted separately and have been edited and condensed for clarity.IndieWire: What made you want to get involved in “Dogville” when Lars von Trier approached you?Skarsgård: All films with Lars are memorable … because they’re all films that have never been made before. It’s a delicious thing to be working with. But of course, it was very exciting. We were living on a small pension in rural Sweden, and it was a fabulous cast. With Harriet Andersson, Lauren Bacall, everybody. It was amazing.Sevigny: He’s been one of my favorite filmmakers since I was a kid. “Breaking the Waves” was really meaningful to me. I saw it countless times in a movie theater, and I just thought he was such a distinct, original voice and approaching filmmaking in such a new and distinct way. He’s just very singular in my mind.How did he first come to you with the material? Stellan, you agreed to star in “Nymphomaniac” sight unseen in terms of a script after von Trier pitched you on a “porn film.”Skarsgård: With me, he’s just coming with an idea. But also, when you read his scripts, they’re always tight. They don’t leak. He could publish the scripts and you wouldn’t have to make a film out of them. He thinks he can improvise, but you can’t, because no one can improvise like he writes, because he writes in kind of a nursery rhyme language — very childish, naïve. You can’t really improvise it. [With “Dogville,”], he sent me the script, and I read it, and of course, I said yes.Sevigny: He came to me. Harmony [Korine] and I had done “Julien Donkey Boy” [which was made under the rules of Dogme 95]. He knew about me because of that, and we worked with [“Dogville” cinematographer”] Anthony Dod Mantle on that, so I imagine he had just heard about me.Stellan, you play a brutish character who assaults Nicole Kidman’s character multiple times. Did you have any trepidation about the material?Skarsgård: He’s not a very nice guy, he’s very brutal, but still a human being. There are no nice or bad guys in the world. It’s fun to play a role like that. The worse, the better. I raped Nicole Kidman [in character] five times, and we had a lot of fun doing it, and it was very successful. And then Lars says to me, “Do you think you can play it like a romantic comedy?” And then I say, “Of course I can,” and I play it as a romantic comedy, and of course it doesn’t work. But there are a few lines that, because of the different angle of attack, actually become fantastic and work. He takes them and uses them.There’s a making-of documentary on the DVD of “Dogville” where, behind the scenes, everybody went alone into these confession booths and told their stories about the movie. It seemed like everyone had a joyous time despite the tough material.Skarsgård: It’s fun doing horrible things. … You put the characters through horrible situations, and you have a lot of fun doing it, and when you come up with something really horrible, you have even more fun.Sevigny: I had a lot of fun on the movie. It was exhausting being on your feet all day long, but it was fun and playful. We all sat down in the beginning before we shot. He had us all in a circle in our cast chairs, and he played us his version of “Pirate Jenny” from “Threepenny Opera,” which the movie is conceived of or kind of based on. The Bergman actress in the movie [Harriet Andersson], she started performing it. It was all these magical moments like that. She took center stage and was singing it in German. And Lauren Bacall in the makeup chair, I could go on and on.Lars notoriously said he wrote this movie during a 12-day drug binge. He’s since gotten sober. What was your impression of his mental state on the movie?Skarsgård: He was in great shape. If he wrote it under a binge, he sort of went away with a bag of cocaine and wrote for a couple of days or a week. He had nothing of that during the shoot. There were no drugs. But there was a lot of alcohol. We shoot five days a week, and then on the weekends we had big parties at the pension we were staying at, and we had a lot of fun.Sevigny: He’s a workhorse. He’s very prolific. He’s like a master. You can’t do that not in a coherent state of mind. That’s also part of his sense of humor. He, unfortunately, likes to provoke in ways that make people really uncomfortable and he has only hurt himself. He would have a Schnapps at lunch but that’s part of the culture there. I was just in Australia with my Serbian family, my husband’s family, and they have this sort of Schnapps-y thing at lunch, too. In France, everybody has wine at lunch.He also liked to do these grand toasts, so I think the Schnapps was part of that. He liked to have a big moment of unity because it was like he wanted everybody to be as invested in what he was doing as he was. It helped motivate people to feel a part of something. It was like an energy that he was bringing.Chloë, Stellan mentioned some parties. Were you part of these?Sevigny: We were all in the same hotel that was right near a paper plant, and I just remember it all, the ever-present pulp smell. On the weekends I would also travel because I was like, I’m all the way over here, I might as well check stuff out. So I went to Gothenburg and Oslo. But yeah there were a lot of parties. Nicole had a Mexican-themed party where she flew in chefs because we were all so sick of the Swedish food. And there was another party where she brought oysters and caviar. She was really playing the part of a movie star. I was like, wow, this woman is classy. She knows how to do it.In the making-of documentary, James Caan points out that everybody was drinking a lot of Red Bull.Skarsgård: I don’t know. I don’t think I’ve heard of Red Bull. But maybe he did.Stellan, what was your impression of Nicole Kidman?Skarsgård: She had just gotten out of the divorce with Tom Cruise, and she was probably, it’s very hard for her. She’s also extremely brave. She’s a woman who was a teenager when she met Tom Cruise and became isolated since in this bubble of Hollywood and became famous, and to go out and do something like [“Dogville”]? It was a brave bunch of people, except me because I’m used to that.Chloe, you’re part of a massive ensemble in this movie. Did you get much one-on-one time with Lars? Some of your fellow actors felt otherwise, but Nicole often took off with Lars for long walks on set to dish out her character.Sevigny: We spent a lot of time all together. I was thinking about our house, how it was kind of like a summer camp situation, because we were all onstage all the time [in every scene] together because were obviously in the background [of every scene, as there were no walls], and we had these long lunches where we’d have Schnapps and we’d have dinners and eat breakfast together. We all spent a lot of time together.I don’t know how much one-on-one time I had with him. Nicole is the star of the movie, he’s obviously spending more time with her. But I do remember him being very personal. He knew that I was really into the Norwegian Black Metal scene so he would tease me. He obviously has a renowned twisted sense of humor, and he used to always tease me about going to, like, burn stave churches because the black metal scene in Norway was famous for burning down stave churches. He knew what I was doing and he would get in there and he was very playful.At the Cannes press conference, Lars was asked by a journalist why his movies all feature the torture of women. He said that watching men being tortured is boring. Have you ever felt tortured by him as an actor?Skarsgård: No. The thing is, he’s perceived by, especially American journalists, as a [mysognist], doing horrible things to women. “He doesn’t like women.” He likes women. The women roles are himself. He is probably one of the best writers of female roles in the world. He’s writing about himself as a woman. It’s much easier to put a woman in a vulnerable situation, right, than a man. A woman shows her vulnerability in a way that a man doesn’t.Lauren Bacall seemed to not have a great time on this movie, though he brought her back for “Manderlay.” She said in interviews that Lars had trouble “tolerating” her. How would you characterize their relationship as you witnessed it, and what was your impression of her?Skarsgård: He had a very bad conscience because he had two of the great film stars, female film stars in history. Lauren Bacall and Harriet Anderson. They were playing a couple and they were often just sweeping the floor in the background. They didn’t have much to do. And he felt so ashamed of that. [Lauren is] a very intimidating woman. If she says, “Lars, can’t you give me something?” He can’t. He can’t give her something. It’s stupid in a way to cast her in such a small role. But he wanted to work with her again. And she wanted to work with him again. I spent a lot of time with her because Lars didn’t have time enough for her. She felt abandoned. So I stepped in there and hung with her a lot.Sevigny: She was, I mean, not to speak ill, but she was a little cranky. I think Stellan was kind of also always chatting with me, flirtatious and playful, so therefore she didn’t like me because she wanted Stellan’s attention, in all honesty. I remember she was very tricky with the makeup.Right, she really struggled with the no-makeup thing.Sevigny: It was a whole new kind of process for her. She’s so old school, I think it was a little confusing to be a background artist. I remember I was very intimidated. My boyfriend at the time came, and he was so into her and Bogey and her whole lore, and I was like, “I don’t know, I’m really nervous around her.” He was like, “Don’t be scared of an old lady.” I was like, “You can’t call her that!”Skarsgård: Remember the bravery of her … there was nothing of star treatment going on there. We were in the middle of fucking nowhere in Sweden, isolated for six weeks. It was very brave of her to do something so uncomfortable and it wasn’t much of a role. All actors were doing this for no money. And all actors were doing this without makeup.Chloë, that’s not the first time I’ve heard of Stellan being flirtatious with a colleague.Sevigny: Hugh Grant is getting a whole talking to about all that. But it’s the truth of it. We’re all together, we’re all having these crazy dinners, we’re all drinking, we’re all pre-cell phones, you talk to each other, you flirt with each other, it’s fun.Do you remember any specific direction Lars gave you that struck you?Sevigny: I remember he had this specific exercise where he was going to have us improvise within our families. It was me and Jeremy [Davies] and Blair [Brown], I can’t remember the gentleman who played my father. Each of the households had to do these 20-minute improvs within the household, and at the end, he was going to grade us. I think I got the lowest score but then it ended up that I had the highest score because I was doing the least, the least best acting by underacting.Stellan, do you and Lars feel more at ease with each other on a set because you’re now good friends?Skarsgård: I don’t know that he sees me as an actor because I don’t think he’s seen my other films. He of course feels extremely at home with me in the room, and I know how to handle him. He has less anxiety, I think, when I’m around. He referred to me one time, I’m like the castrated bull they have to blend with the bullfighting bulls.[On “Dogville”], you felt you were supposed to make mistakes. He had a big sign on “Breaking the Waves” that said, “Make mistakes.” You feel so safe, you feel so well looked after. And the language is of course very coarse. He says things in interviews, like, whatever. He says whatever, but it’s in a friendly way.That got him into trouble in 2011 when he jokingly called himself a Nazi and said he “understood Hitler” at the Cannes press conference for “Melancholia,” essentially torching the movie in the U.S. along with Kirsten Dunst’s hoped-for Oscar chances.Skarsgård: The problem is that the rest of the world is so afraid, and so they take words not for what they mean but for what they are. It’s stupid. Everybody knew in that room that he was not a Nazi and yet for Hollywood reporters, there was Lars von Trier, “I’m a Nazi.” He was talking about something else. It’s so silly.You could see Kirsten’s face curdle into complete collapse as he said it.Skarsgård: She lives in Hollywood. She’s more dependent – he can hurt her, but he can’t hurt me.Have you been in touch with Lars since he became sick?Sevigny: I had just heard that he was a little sick [because of this interview]. I knew he’d had some issues in the past but I didn’t know he was ailing, so I was thinking about writing Matt Dillon and getting his contact and sending him a letter. I think I used to send him some snail mail back in the day. I still have a few notes of his that he sent me.The 4K restoration of “Dogville” premieres on Mubi Friday, April 14.",

        "title": "‘Self Reliance’ Review: Jake Johnson and The Lonely Island Team Up for a Comedic Take on ‘The Game’",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 SXSW Film Festival. Hulu releases the film on its streaming platform on Friday, January 12.Jake Johnson makes his feature directorial debut with “Self Reliance,” a comedy with a fascinating premise and an opening act that provides equal thrills and laughs. Unfortunately, while Johnson’s script shows promise, the actor/writer-turned-director squanders it with a lack of strong vision, and a rom-com element that makes the film lose focus, and also most laughs.What if you take David Fincher’s “The Game,” but run it through The Lonely Island‘s comedy filter? That’d get you close to “Self Reliance,” which starts strong but loses itself in an attempt to juggle too many tones at once. We meet Johnson’s protagonist, Tom, a man conforming to a sad routine he repeats every single day. He goes to the same bar, watches the same cowboy movies, and repeatedly tries and fails to knock on his ex-girlfriend’s door to ask her why she suddenly broke up with him.Tom sees little value in his life, which is why he is especially thrilled when Andy Samberg — yes, actor Andy Samberg, who also produces the movie — shows up as himself in a limousine and offers Tom a chance at adventure. Granted, Tom has no idea what he’s signing up for. But he blindly gets in the car with Samberg anyway, agreeing to be taken to the middle of nowhere without a single clue as to where they’re going or what they’re doing.The offer, as it turns out, is to participate in a Dark Web show where Tom has a chance to win a million bucks. The catch? He will be hunted for 30 days, and only if he makes it out alive will he get the money. Oh, and they can only try to kill him when he is alone. If Tom is in close proximity to any other person, his hunters have to stand down. Easy peasy, right? Well, Tom doesn’t count on his family blatantly mocking him when he tries to explain the deadly situation, and immediately leaving him alone despite his repeated pleas and warnings of the mortal danger he’s facing.“Self Reliance” runs effectively with that setup, at first. The family dismissing Tom, his desperate attempts to stay physically close to his brother-in-law, and then a homeless guy Tom hires to shadow his every move are outright hilarious. Like Fincher’s “The Game,” though, it also knows when to turn up the tension once we see that Tom is not lying and there really are hunters after him. Also like that film, part of the tension comes in making both the characters, and at times even the audience, unsure whether they should trust the protagonist’s interpretation of the situation or not. Johnson knows how to mine humor from the absurdity of his script. The film is at its best when doubling down on the absurdity of its premise, finding excuses to send in assailants dressed as Michael Jackson and Mario from “Super Mario Bros.”The problem is that, while Johnson crafted a good script that balances multiple tones, his directing isn’t as confident in that tightrope. Sure, there are moments of tension and comedy, but as soon as Johnson introduces a romantic element in the form of Anna Kendrick’s Maddie — someone who reaches out to Tom via a CraigsList ad and says she is also a contestant — the momentum comes to a halt. Almost immediately, the film pivots into indie rom-com territory, trading the outlandish premise and absurdist tone for a grounded and understated focus on the film’s themes about human connection and overcoming self-doubt.Nothing wrong with this, of course, but the film fails to navigate that pivot in an effective way. As much as Johnson and Kendrick have terrific chemistry and their interactions feel organic, with each trying to one-up the other during the game, Kendrick’s character exits as abruptly as she enters the film. This makes both her character and her subplot feel like an afterthought.“Self Reliance” is a fine showcase for Johnson’s everyman acting chops, as well as his ability to craft an interesting script, but the overall story and execution are underwhelming. The result is not Fincher’s “The Game,” but it certainly is not “Ride the Eagle” either.“Self Reliance” premiered at the 2023 SXSW Film Festival.",

        "title": "‘Bottoms’ Review: The ‘Shiva Baby’ Team Returns with Idiosyncratic Queer Teen Comedy",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 SXSW Film Festival. MGM releases the film in select theaters on Friday, August 25, with expansion to follow on Friday, September 1.The easiest way to describe Emma Seligman‘s sophomore feature, “Bottoms“? It’s hilariously weird. Director Seligman and star Rachel Sennott reunite in their follow-up to “Shiva Baby,” taking as hard a pivot from their 2020 breakout (and a script they co-wrote) as they come.This is a queer teen sex comedy that wears its influences on its sleeve, yet still resembles no other film. It cements Seligman and Sennott as two of the most exciting young voices in cinema today, delivering a hit in the making with a tone that brings movies like “Wet Hot American Summer” and “Not Another Teen Movie” to a whole new generation.Before the film’s premiere at this year’s SXSW Film Festival, audiences were told to prepare themselves for an experience that could not be described. That’s pretty much what they got. This is a film set in a weird, parallel world with almost cartoon-like logic, a world heightened to the point of self-serious parody, where the high school’s biggest jock-himbo has his face plastered on every surface of the school and there is a giant mural of himself as Adam in “The Creation of Adam” adorning the cafeteria, a world where the feminism teacher openly reads a nude magazine called “Divorced and Happy” during class — he’s played by Marshawn Lynch, a highlight of the movie.It is a tone that could easily not have worked, and it does only because Seligman and Sennott pack the script with so many jokes that you don’t have time to really think about whether one joke landed for you before getting hit with another one that has you shaking and cackling. It helps that Seligman fully embraces an absurdist tone and packs the film with visual gags to sell the idea — like the aforementioned mural. It is not dissimilar to the way “Wet Hot American Summer” used its ridiculous casting to ease you into its wacky world before introducing its end-of-the-world subplot.Here, feral students are kept in cages, murder is just a regular thing that happens, and it is all shrugged off as normal. Granted, the film’s humor is often uncomfortable and “problematic,” particularly by the time you get to the third joke about bombing a school, but it’s the tone that sells the less savory parts of the script.It is in this absurd world that we meet PJ (Sennott) and Josie (Ayo Edebiri), two best friends who are at the bottom of the high school social ladder — they are losers and they’re gay, a bad combination in a school that, again, quite literally worships its straightest male. After an incident in which the two confront the head jock-himbo after trying to hit on his girlfriend, the popular cheerleader Isabel (Havana Rose Liu), PJ and Josie are accused of “assaulting” the star football player and threatened with expulsion.Thanks to some easily spread rumors about Josie’s time in juvie, the two manage to spin their assault charges by taking advantage of the (literal) blood feud between their school and their football rival into making an official, school-sanctioned fight club. Granted, their excuse is they’re teaching girls self-defense and also raising solidarity among girls, but the truth is it is literally just a fight club — and one they created solely to try and hook up with cheerleaders.Unlike “Shiva Baby,” which used tight shots and quick edits to create tension, Seligman squeezes every ounce of awkward humor from the characters in “Bottoms” by letting the camera linger in order until you are just about to start cringing. Yet, what is most impressive is Seligman’s skills at building and executing action scenes. This is a movie about a fight club, after all, so fists are often up. There is one particularly bloody, big-scale fight that has clearer and more intricate choreography than most action scenes in big blockbuster movies of the past year.At the bottom of the film’s knotted plot and raunchy jokes, however, lies a rather poignant story about female friendship and empowerment. Though it starts as a genuine desire to protect themselves from a rival school that is literally kidnapping and beating up students (free of consequence, one might add), the girls get more out of the club than just good fighting skills.Though the focus is always on PJ and Josie — Sennott and Edebiri are phenomenal, with the film serving as an “Ayo and Rachel Are Single” reunion — the supporting cast really makes the movie shine. From the rest of the fight club members, each one with their own unique personality that manages to become more than archetypes even when they don’t have that much screentime, to the football players baffled and enraged by the girl’s fight club taking attention away from their games, “Bottoms” has a terrific ensemble.“Bottoms” is an ambitious sophomore feature from a director who is just getting started, one that can craft both a hilariously surreal teen sex comedy and marry it with one hell of an eye for action sequences. Josie and PJ may be at the bottom of the food chain, but Sennott and Seligman are anything but.“Bottoms” premiered at the 2023 SXSW Film Festival. MGM and Orion Pictures will release it at a later date.",

        "title": "‘Scrambled’ Review: Leah McKendrick Is Born a Star in Coming-of-Age Fertility Dramedy",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 SXSW Film Festival. Lionsgate releases the film in theaters and on various digital and VOD platforms on Friday, February 2.Lena Dunham had “Girls.” Amy Schumer had “Trainwreck.” And now, Leah McKendrick has “Scrambled.” The filmmaker and star behind the dramedy “Scrambled” shines in this coming-of-age fertility saga, which chronicles an aimless 34-year-old who decides to freeze her eggs amid the onslaught of weddings, bridal showers, and babies her peers are suddenly throwing.The film follows Los Angeles native Nellie (McKendrick), whose best friend Sheila (“Saturday Night Live” standout Ego Nwodim) is getting married. Gone are their days of doing coke together and partying without consequence: Sheila is pregnant and tying the knot, while Nellie gets stuck rolling on ecstasy by herself at the reception.That’s where she crosses paths with her friend group idol Monroe (June Diane Raphael) who informs Nellie that becoming a mother at age 40 was the most painful experience of her life. With over $50,000 sunk into IVF to produce daughter Zophia (yes, with a Z), Monroe warns Nellie that her thirties are not to be wasted and she needs to plan ahead for every possible future she may want later.But that’s not what Nellie needs to hear right now. She’s an Etsy jewelry seller who’s newly single and still hooks up with hot bartenders who have “Scarface” and/or “Reservoir Dogs” posters in their bedrooms. “I don’t even know if I want kids,” Nellie cries. “I’ve seen ‘Euphoria’!” As Nellie’s parents, played by Clancy Brown and Laura Cerón, pressure her to start a family by gifting her “motivational” baby shoes, she wonders what the harm is in “buying more time” for her fertility journey. Well, the price tag is one thing.Nellie begs to borrow cash from her brother (Andrew Santino) and eventually starts the painful and emotional process of freezing her eggs. She’s not allowed to drink or have sex, but Nellie’s baby-making journey has officially begun as she embarks on a “What’s Your Number?” jaunt down memory lane. Nellie finds herself wearing her prom dress to a bar in the Valley and hooking up with her prom king ex-boyfriend (Sterling Sulieman) in a last hurrah to singlehood sans eggs in a freezer. Later, a hilarious encounter with a “Peter Pan” ex (Adam Rodriguez) reminds Nellie why she wasn’t wrong in breaking up with these guys in the first place.But everything seems to fall apart when the girlfriend of Nellie’s one true love and most recent ex Shawn (Harry Shum Jr.) gets pregnant, and Nellie wonders if the clock has run out already before she could buy the time she needed. From miscarriages to a reproductive loss therapy group to the mention of a past abortion, “Scrambled” covers the reproductive plights of womanhood in a darkly comedic and utterly relatable way.At times, “Scrambled” feels like a TV show, which isn’t a bad thing at all. In fact, it’s a compliment: the film has quick quips, good timing, and tight pacing mostly found in nowadays in episodic structures. When Nellie writes a letter to her 20 frozen eggs saying that she’s proud of “us” and signs it as “Mom,” it’s the kind of pay-off that a six seasons and a movie cult favorite TV show would feel like.“Scrambled” is a toast to McKendrick herself, who is among IndieWire’s top female filmmakers to watch this year. And get used to seeing her work: McKendrick is also writing the script for the upcoming “I Know What You Did Last Summer” film directed by “Do Revenge” breakout Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, plus penning “Grease” prequel “Summer Lovin.'” The high concept IP projects in the works only proves that Hollywood has finally caught up with McKendrick.As for “Scrambled,” here’s a fair warning: “Scrambled” will make you text your ex — or former Hinge hookup with a “hey stranger” — but in the end, you’ll feel confident knowing your best self is still just dancing on your own. Here’s to that.“Scrambled” premiered at the 2023 SXSW Film Festival.",

        "title": "‘Golda’ Review: Helen Mirren’s Golda Meir Biopic Is Less Than the Sum of Its Parts",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Berlin Film Festival. Bleecker Street releases the film in theaters on Friday, August 25.Defending her conduct during the Yom Kippur War before a panel of graying men, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir (Helen Mirren) takes the half-smoked cigarette already dangling from her lips and, instinctually but not all absentmindedly, uses it to light another. This idiosyncratic character beat arrives early in Guy Nattiv’s ho-hum biopic, and speaks volumes about story and subject, telling all you need to know about Meir the person and “Golda” the film.That Golda’s a smoker should come as no shock; nearly everyone is in this period accurate window into 1973. What sets the Prime Minister apart is her doggedness – her clarity of purpose and tenacity of intent. This cancer-struck icon makes a point to light up each time she undergoes radiation treatment, smoking less for pleasure than in defiance of her own, not-too-distant end. That Mirren should seize on this tic should come with even less surprise, for what is a Marlboro if not an actor’s best friend, a reliable partner, a gift for idle hands, a way to punctuate a line, a scene, a read?Which returns us to this pregnant puff and the film it presages. In theory a docudrama reliving the 1973 Yom Kippur War from the perch of power, “Golda” is, in practice, a compendium of actorly affects, a spotlight on a venerable performer offering them a stage on which to shine. Pushed and pulled between conflicting tonal and narrative approaches, Nattiv’s film finds its clearest identity as an awards bait corollary to a hacky stand-up bit: What if they made the whole plane out of the black box? What if they made the whole film out of the Oscar reel?The result would look something like this. After a framing device finds Meir testifying before the Agranat Commission – a 1974 panel that investigated the intelligence failures that left the young state unprepared for the previous year’s war – we flashback to the morning of October 6 1973, when word of an impending assault reached the Prime Minister’s desk. To one side of Meir sits IDF chief of staff David Elazar (Lior Ashkenazi), and to the other, Defense Minister Moshe Dayan (Rami Heuberger). Both offer conflicting advice, and if screenwriter Nicholas Martin’s dialogue hews close to the historical record, the visuals tell a markedly different story.The fact actors Ashkenazi and Heuberger (and many others in supporting roles) are Israeli and Mirren is decidedly not has hardly been lost on irate commentators, though to see the dynamic play out onscreen really does resolve that tension. Because in the end, the film’s centrifugal force is Mirren, not Meir. You could certainly make a version of this story with (what some might deem) a more ethnically appropriate lead, but that film wouldn’t be “Golda.” Indeed, the attraction here is to see an actor transform, to search for a familiar face under a mask of make-up, finding comfort in their unchanged eyes.In other words, we want to see movie stars in dress-up, and on that front, “Golda” delivers. And if following that mandate lends this biopic a herky-jerk quality — cycling dissonant tones in order to give the star a variety of notes to play — the approach has undeniable merit from scene to scene.As the war begins, the Prime Minister and her top advisors head into bunker mode, watching the Israeli forces take catastrophic losses as a sense of existential panic grows ever more acute. There is a version of this film that fully tracks this paradox of power – the sad truth that the Rooms Where It Happens tend to be drab and banal and oh so far from the fields where victory might be snatched from the jaws of defeat. And hey, that film does exist within “Golda,” most notably in a standout sequence that finds the top brass listening to a failed offensive on radio waves, while utterly powerless to step in.Of course, this war-in-real-time version must co-exist with a number of others, including those require a bit winking irony (“They’ll make you prime minister,” Meir tells a brash general who goes by Sharon), and those that seize upon another key attraction of the genre – to see how well-mediatized icons behave once the cameras turn off. Often mixing archival footage with staged recreations, Nattiv takes evident pleasure when delivering on that front.That mix-and-match style veers dangerously into camp once Secretary of State Henry Kissinger pays Meir a visit. The scene begins with a flurry of archival reports, following the real figure from the Tel Aviv tarmac to the gates outside of Meir’s residence. When we cut to the inside – to where those live cameras couldn’t take us – in walks Liev Schreiber and out comes the borscht. Whereas earlier war cabinet scenes play out as austere as a daylong fast, the film gives in to the appeal of make-believe once its two most iconic characters find themselves behind closed doors.“Madame Prime Minister,” Schreiber says in an oft-imitated monotone. “I am first the Secretary of State, and then an American, only then a Jew.” Turning on the bubbe charm as she force-feeds him some borscht, Meir responds: “You forget that in Israel, we read from right to left.” Not a bad line as far as shtick goes, but certainly one that sticks out when bookended by sequences as dry and severe as matzoh, and all the more given the project’s attempt to elide any thornier moral and political questions by sticking to a here-and-now, just-the-facts approach.Ultimately, “Golda” holds three firm beliefs: That Meir is a leader to admire, that Mirren is an actress to adore, and that all interactions must be reverse engineered to fit this limited scope. It makes for a superficial biopic and blinkered bit of history, but does give the venerable performer a new accent to chew on and the chance to blow some smoke. It’s a good role in a film always less than the sum of its parts.“Golda” premiered at the 2023 Berlin Film Festival. Bleecker Street will release it later this year.",

        "title": "‘Disco Boy’ Review: Franz Rogowski Stars in French Foreign Legion Drama That Bluntly Portrays the Horrors of War",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Berlin Film Festival. Big World Pictures releases the film in select theaters on Friday, February 2 with expansion to follow.It might be reductive to call “Disco Boy” a kind of club kid cousin to “Beau Travail,” but the comparisons aren’t entirely off. Like Claire Denis’ Sight and Sound chart-topper, here is a tour with the French Foreign Legion, another dissection of colonial roleplaying spent among a taciturn lot who find best expression in the rhythms of the night. So let’s dispense those comparisons up front, and with a degree of military efficiency befitting both films: While director Giacomo Abbruzzese does indeed pay homage to a direct artistic forbearer, his debut film stands (and writhes and shimmies) all on its own.Pushed and pulled by another intensely physical Franz Rogowski turn, “Disco Boy” follows a man ever on the move, a paperless migrant whose name, identity, nationality and, it seems, spiritual sense of self remain constantly in flux.The actor enters the film as Aleksei, a Belarusian ex-con quietly carving his way through Poland en route to a better life. Why settle on France as the final destination? Well, pourquoi pas? Aleksey has picked up some rudimentary French – “From the movies,” says Rogowski, spitting out his rare lines of dialogue as if poison to be expelled post haste – but for the most part, he simply follows the lead of his more experienced travel partner, Mikhail (Michał Balicki). Yet the crossing is not without risk, and by the time our lead winds up a stray dog in Gaul, that travel companion, Mikhail is but a ghost haunting the path. He will not be the last.Split into the three chapters with discrete aesthetic and formal approaches, and condensed into a tight 90-minutes that nevertheless covers substantial narrative ground, “Disco Boy” follows what could be called “club logic.” The three chapters introduce as many foils — thematic dance partners whose interplay and interaction with Aleksei reorient his path. By the time Mikhail gives way to an altogether different foil in Chapter Two, Aleksei himself has also changed. Awash in a destination no less hostile than the road that led there, Aleksei the migrant becomes Alex the legionnaire. And who knows, after five years of dutiful service, he might just become a French citizen.Long before Abbruzzese opens Chapter Three on a literal dance floor, “Disco Boy” brims with sinister nocturnal energy. Whether traipsing through a Subcarpathian forest as Aleksey or submitting his body to military training as Alex, Rogowski moves to an unrelenting thrum — a low and menacing electro score supplied by French producer Vitalic. More soundscape than soundtrack, this metallic dirge plays off cinematographer Hélène Louvart’s decadent lighting schemes to set viewers on edge and replicate that initial rush of walking into a foreboding neon cathedral. Tense and mesmerized, you feel all the more alert.Still, as an immersive visual and intellectual spectacle, the film might peak too early. With training and enlistment now complete, Chapter Two takes us into the field, on mission with Alex and his unit in the Niger Delta. For the first (and only) time, Abbruzzese’s camera leaves the lead behind, focusing instead on Jomo (Morr Ndiaye), a local insurgent leading guerilla attacks against international exploiters. He is, of course, what draws in the French unit. Would you be surprised that they side with the Big Oil exploiters?Neither aiming for nor interested in subtlety, “Disco Boy” casts both Jomo and Alex as soldiers of fate and pawns of fortune, two sides of the same coin pulled into conflict by capital. Underscoring the blunt message with thrillingly blunt-force filmmaking, Abbruzzese orchestrates a series of raids and counter-raids with wanton flair, bathing a pivotal nighttime assault with an infrared glare that obscures predator from prey, and staging a decisive moment between Alex and Jomo on a riverbank seemingly pulled from a previous chapter. The distance between Poland and Nigeria suddenly collapsed, as if to say, wherever you go, there you are.In that roundabout way, we find a director wrestling with that familiar and paradoxical question: How do you shoot war without glorying it? Offering his response as capstone to this lethal second act, Abbruzzese grabs a blade and simply cuts the knot. Surveying the final damage with sweeping, helicopter-mounted vistas, “Disco Boy” is unambiguous about the thrill of such military adventurism and unsparing about the awful moral toll.Those bells continue to ring through to the end. Back in France for chapter three, and drowning his sorrows at a chic Parisian discothèque, Aleksey-cum-Alex makes a chance encounter with Adoka (Laëtitia Ky). Who is this latest dance partner? Is she a woman with ties to the Nigerian mission or a pure  manifestation of a soldier’s guilt?  In this more figurative back third, the distinction matters not a whit. His wider political points already emblazoned on screen, Abbruzzese moves from ‘club logic’ to dream logic, tracking the legionnaire’s final (d)evolution with a style meant to evoke that point of night when the walls of reality crumble.Of course, elevating style as substance can be an awfully effective way to cover a narrative shrug with panache, and one can track the film as it  gradually loses stamina in real time. But at a taut and elliptical ninety minutes, a couple of awkward final steps hardly feel like fatal flaws. Getting in, getting down, and getting out as style hopping sizzle reel, “Disco Boy” heralds a promising new talent who totally has the moves.“Disco Boy” premiered at the 2023 Berlin Film Festival.",

        "title": "‘The Adults’ Review: Michael Cera’s Cringe-Out Sibling Drama Is Surprisingly Moving",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Berlin Film Festival. Variance Films releases the film in select theaters on Friday, August 18.Sibling in-jokes — often first formed when our brains are still goofy and undeveloped, and honed through the hysteria of spending too much time with somebody who shares your DNA — are often the most absurd and abiding. The silly voices, the elaborate bits, the rehearsed dance routines, the specific style of patter that an outsider would find impenetrable. But what happens when you grow up, and a family tragedy rips you apart? What do you do when you feel obligated to stay in touch with the siblings you still love, but nostalgia for your childhood has suddenly become too painful a memory to indulge in?Dustin Guy Defa’s “The Adults” is an emotional scream transposed through low-decibel vocal fry — an endearing sibling drama full of cringe comedy that lands a miraculous, unexpectedly poignant ending, seemingly out of nowhere. Despite the central trio holding each other — and by proxy, the viewer — at arm’s length for the majority of the film’s running time, cynical defenses are chipped away to raise up the sibling relationship as one of the most knotty and meaningful humans can have.Michael Cera plays Eric, who is really just Michael Cera with a new name (he is also the film’s producer). Eric is back in the picturesque town he grew up in for a flying visit to see his two sisters, Rachel (Hannah Gross) and Maggie (Sophia Lillis), as well as an old buddy who’s just had a baby. The siblings haven’t seen each other for three years, and save for the occasional, performative phone call, Eric has deliberately created a chasm of distance between them, preferring to throw himself into his unspecified job in the unspecified city he now lives in.Nobody knows your fears, your neuroses, your hang-ups, and your past better than the people you grew up with, and so if you were trying to be someone you’re not or avoid working through your feelings, it makes sense that your siblings are the people you would take special pains to avoid. But because of an absurd obsession with wanting to beat his old poker buddies and prove himself as reigning champ in his humdrum hometown, Eric ends up extending his stay; the more time he spends with his sisters, the more he realizes that the careful, ironclad distance he has created is at risk of falling apart, exposing the cavern of trauma housed between them.The beady eyes, the nonexistent chin, the humpback triangle posture and the high-pitched register: Cera has built his career on being the human equivalent of an awkward silence, a walking punchline that seems to exist on a different cosmic plane of oddball charisma.This persona, carved out of mainstream comedy roles in “Superbad,” “Juno,” “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,” and more, is by no means out of place in the low-key American indie, as already evidenced in Defa’s “Person to Person.” But while that 2017 feature felt a little rambling and overcooked, “The Adults” banks on its affably weird lead to make an astute statement about how depressing it is to go from being a funny, quirky guy to — seemingly without knowing it has even happened — a tragic and blundering sell-out, a sad sack in his flop era who creates black holes in conversations every time he speaks.While at first even eye contact is elusive, over painfully tense arguments over a hoover, hidden jokes that turn sour and weird, and agonizingly cringe-worthy conversations, the three siblings edge toward something resembling a reconciliation. As the youngest who is desperate to recreate the shared, loving language of her youth, Lillis is a live wire with Duracell Bunny energy and warmth, a foil to Gross’ sardonic and gothy older sister. As they recreate the infantile exploits of their childhood — dancing in the garden, congregating gawkily at parties, going to the bowling alley, and taking a trip to the zoo — every restrained line of dialogue is an unsturdy branch, concealing a thousand knotted roots underneath the muddy surface.It may feel a little too surreally awkward and plodding in its first hour. But as a sweet movie smartly attuned to the power of the weirdo bonds that bind us to our family no matter the geographical distance or emotional dislocation, Defa achieves a sledgehammer of an ending in which not a single word rings false or feels sentimental: a raw, sensitive, and true look at a family in flux with too much love to give and no tools to whittle it into something useful.“The Adults” premiered at the 2023 Berlin International Film Festival.",

        "title": "‘BlackBerry’ Review: The Once-Ubiquitous Smartphone Gets Its Own Spin on ‘The Social Network’",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Berlin Film Festival. IFC Films releases the film in theaters on Friday, May 12.Is there anything worse than becoming obsolete? It’s a fear many share — to be slowly forgotten and discarded, left on a proverbial roadside as the rest of the world continues to innovate at pace around us. It isn’t just a business concern, but a human one: the innate craving for relevancy in a world where something or someone shinier than you is always around the corner.The BlackBerry, with its distinctive QWERTY click-click keypad, met a sobering fate when it faded into quiet obscurity in the past decade — going from having a 43 percent market share in 2010 to zero percent just six years later — and when it was announced that a film charting the smartphone’s rise and fall had landed a Berlinale competition slot, one’s initial thoughts were: oh, that old thing?But “BlackBerry,” which follows Canadian software company Research in Motion and the mistakes made by co-CEOs Mike Lazarides (Jay Baruchel) and Jim Balsillie (Glenn Howerton), uses lashes of retrospective irony to dive into the precarity of monolithic success. With a good deal of zippy snark à la “The Social Network” and a sense of deadpan comedy straight from the “Succession” playbook, “BlackBerry” is the kind of mid-budget marvel that doesn’t seem to come around often anymore.With it, director and screenwriter Matt Johnson takes a plot that could be a dull walk-through of the phone’s Wikipedia page and transforms it into something altogether more biting and blithe, less a cautionary tale than a gently mocking takedown of corporate hubris.It’s hard to remember where it all went wrong for the BlackBerry: one day men were more likely to ask for a girl’s BBM pin than her phone number, and then the existence of the phone was seemingly scrubbed from our collective memory. We meet Lazarides and his bumbling co-founder Douglas Fregin (played by Johnson himself) in 1992, when Research in Motion is more an after-school club of film nerds than budding start-up, before a catastrophic product pitch somehow piques the interest of tech businessman Balsillie.It’s not long before Lazarides’ innovative product and Balsillie’s shrewd salesmanship sends the phone skyrocketing. The beginning of the end arrives in 2007 when Steve Jobs unveiled the touchscreen Apple iPhone, immediately making the BlackBerry look like a quaint antique.Beyond plot twists and turns, though — of which there are many, in a surprisingly fascinating peek into the developments of handheld telephony over the past three decades (stay with me) — Johnson’s direction and script is the movie’s secret weapon. While adapted from Jacquie McNish’s book “Losing the Signal: The Untold Story Behind the Extraordinary Rise and Spectacular Fall of BlackBerry,” it is Johnson’s trademark style that elevates the material.In a scrappy, DIY-esque sensibility also adopted in 2013’s “The Dirties” and 2016’s “Operation Avalanche,” the outlook is zany and the camera is shaky, deploying endless hand-held comic zooms to enforce a kind of mockumentary smarm. His character is obsessed with movie strong men in works like “Wall Street” and “Glengarry Glen Ross,” yet this film lampoons that very image, exposing the hollowness within.The audience are all in the joke, being fully cognisant of the BlackBerry’s fall from grace; the way Johnson invites us to poke fun at the story and its players initially feels strange, but soon becomes second nature (the phone itself, after all, was dubbed “CrackBerry” and considered the first addictive smartphone). Where it should perhaps feel grating to have the director play such an exaggeratedly bone-headed character of his own attention-grabbing invention (the real Fregin looks like a nice man that you would pay your taxes to), this layer of fictionalization only ameliorates the comic beats. Throw in Jay McCarrol’s tongue-in-cheek electro score and the way company engineers keep pushing up eyeglasses that are already high on the bridge of their nose, and you’re left with something undeniably funny and yet somehow not mean-spirited.It’s not a film in which the people depicted would be happy or flattered with their portrayal; Baruchel’s Lazarides is a pushover with a severe shortage of charisma, while Howerton’s Balsillie is a comic-book Machiavelli of rapacious unlikeability. Yet, alongside Johnson, this central trio put on stellar performances in a film that seems largely unconcerned with personal backstories or money. Baruchel in particular is playing things startlingly small — not, ahem, phoning it in, but rather acting as a neat and necessary straight foil to the other two leads’ megalomania.It’s all a rather fascinating story that we didn’t even know we would be interested in — the way that, both personally and professionally, the need to endlessly innovate in order to stay relevant is exhausting at best and soul-destroying at worst, robbing you of the ability to relax and live in the moment. Here, one’s success always means another’s failure, and therein lies the deeply depressing issue at the heart of capitalism. BlackBerry aren’t the first casualty of this and they won’t be the last. And when a shiny new toy catches our eye, we won’t hesitate to upgrade to the next best shiny thing.“BlackBerry” premiered at the 2023 Berlin International Film Festival.

        "title": "‘Perpetrator’ Review: Alicia Silverstone Cuts Deep in Wacky but Scattered Feminist Horror",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Berlin Film Festival. Shudder releases the film in theaters and on its streaming platform on Friday, September 1.Even in the golden age of highbrow auteur horror, truly cutting feminist horror is still waiting for its “Get Out” moment. That’s not for lack of trying: Rape revenge thrillers were trendy before the tepid pop feminism of “Promising Young Woman” made them a staple of the sub-genre.While feminist horror provocateur Jennifer Reeder (“Knives and Skin”) has tastes far more sinister and far less mainstream, her latest zany invention is an ambitious but uneven jumble of ideas. One part surreal coming of age horror, one part to-catch-a-predator thriller, “Perpetrator” suffers from a novice lead performance and a script that tries to do too much. It’s an ambitious addition to the feminist horror genre with blood and guts to spare, but it’s no game-changer.“Perpetrator” follows scrappy teenager Jonny (Kiah McKirnan), a lone wolf who uses her burglary-earned money to help her distant single father pay the rent. Jonny’s dad is the first clue that something is amiss in this near dystopia: When he looks in the mirror, he sees his face morphing into other people. On a cryptic phone call to a trusted confidante, he begs for respite to “get himself together,” and soon Jonny is being shipped off to live with her stern Great Aunt Hildie (Alicia Silverstone).Looking more like an evil stepmother than a great aunt, Silverstone is a steely delight as the sharp-tongued and demanding mystery lady. Effortlessly chic in her sterile mansion, Hildie is the keeper of a family secret that might explain Jonny’s random nosebleeds and blurry mirror visions. Silverstone delivers her lines in a hyper-stylized staccato, the comical over-enunciation evoking a mix of either an otherworldly spirit or a WASP-y childless aunt. It’s exciting to see her return to acting in something beyond a “Clueless” throwback commercial, much less by taking a bold swing in an independent feminist horror film.But there’s more than meets the eye in this timeless ghost town, which has been terrorized by a string of missing teenage girls. As the new kid to her tony school, Jonny is an outcast and a social curiosity, attracting the attention of both the popular girls and friendly loner Elektra (Ireon Roach). Obsessed with the danger lurking around every corner, an over zealous Principal Burke (Christopher Burke) runs terrifying active-shooter drills. Reeder makes amusing satire out of the pearl-clutching protection of young girls, threading the film with an absurdist sense of humor, like when the girls fret over the grounding they’ll receive for getting killed.When Hildie feeds Jonny a blood-soaked cake for her 18th birthday, she begins to sense and feel experiences and emotions that cause her terrifying visions. Unperturbed by her nosebleeds, she’s less transfixed by blood than Hildie, who can’t help pushing a manicured finger deep into every red spurt she sees. Eventually Hildie reveals their hidden family power, a kind of hyper-empathy that causes deep pain but also bestows certain abilities. When Jonny realizing she’s been sensing the missing girls, which now include many of her popular classmates, she takes it upon herself to find the kidnapper and bring him to justice.A detour into a tender romance with Elektra, while sweet, feels wildly out of place, especially given the lack of character development. The outlandish high school scenes are fertile ground for the kind of unsettling self-discovery Jonny is experiencing, but the measured austerity of Hildie’s house feels like an entirely different world. There’s also the mystery of Jonny’s mother to untangle, her absentee father, and the threat of the kidnapper. Though she’s plucky and easy to watch, McKirnan struggles to connect emotionally with the character, foregoing depth for a cool remove. Only Silverstone, conveying an ageless wisdom behind the eyes, is able to improve on and translate the lofty aims of Reeder’s script.There are satisfying genre elements, to be sure, “Perpetrator” cannot be accused of playing it safe. Blood takes on a kind of mystical element in the film, rarely is there a scene without a splash of it. Though short on jump scares until its gory conclusion, the imagery in the final scene is inventive and creepy. Using light body horror elements to mirror a teenage girl’s changing body works as a metaphor in theory, but in practice it falls flat with the opaque character. Reeder’s ability to conjure sightly askew worlds that mirror and poke fun at contemporary fears is just as daring, but it needed a sharper focus.“Perpetrator” premiered at the 2023 Berlin International Film Festival.

        "title": "‘She Came to Me’ Review: Peter Dinklage and Marisa Tomei Find Love and Madness on a Tugboat",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Berlin Film Festival. Vertical releases the film in theaters on Friday, October 6.Rebecca Miller makes romances. And comedies. And dramas. With character studies still beholden to crazy plots, she’s covered everything from drug addiction to infidelity, incest to ambition. A Rebecca Miller film means releasing expectations, eschewing glossy images and tidy plots, and embracing the mess inherent in life itself. Her films are wild, dreamy, sad, funny — and not at all realistic.That’s certainly the case with “She Came to Me,” which follows a loosely connected group of people all made absolutely crazy by love. Miller delights in toying with what sounds like a cutesy concept, stretching it to wacky (and occasionally wonderful) ends. It may be most closely aligned with her previous film, the 2015 “Maggie’s Plan” (it also poked at the idea of modern romance), but it shares some of the concerns she mined in her debut “Angela” and its belief that religion offers some sort of purity for those who really dedicate themselves to it.Steven (Peter Dinklage) is a lauded composer who famously went bonkers after his last opera bombed five years ago, sending him into a deep (“deep“) depression eventually broken by a romance with his then-therapist, now wife Patricia (Anne Hathaway). Steven, whose latest show is due in two weeks, doesn’t really like being social: We meet him huffing and puffing through a cocktail party, which he exits by attempting to hide behind a large potted plant, a prime place for him to check his skyrocketing heart rate.Steven and the delightfully uptight Patricia have their own problems, but Hathaway turns her supporting role into a meal. She taps into Patricia’s rigidity so deeply that her eventual spin into something very different feels all the more clever “She Came to Me” often functions as an ensemble piece that largely orbits around Steven, but whenever Hathaway’s brutally type-A Patricia appears (this is a woman who has a special lab coat for cleaning), she brings unexpected verve to the film. She’s perhaps the only performer here who knows exactly what her nutty character is doing, or even what she is capable of.Elsewhere, love is thriving. Patricia’s son Julian (Evan Ellison) and his girlfriend Tereza (Harlow Jane) are in the throes of first love: smart enough to be aware that things might change between them, young enough to hope they don’t. Tereza’s maniacal stepdad Trey (an against-type Brian D’Arcy James) and her cynical mother Magdalena (a heartbreaking Joanna Kulig) don’t help matters. (Other ways in which these disparate love stories combine are one of the film’s deepest pleasures, and won’t be spoiled here.)When Steven’s writer’s block kicks into overdrive, Patricia (whom he still calls “Doc”) all but tosses him out of the house in hopes he might “get lost” and find something useful along the way. Soon, Steven and his faithful pup Levi are wandering all over Brooklyn before they stumble into a local dive bar in the middle of the morning. And they’re not alone. Here he finds the inspiration for “She Came To Me” (also the name of his own nutty opera): Katrina (Marisa Tomei), a charming tugboat captain (you read that correctly) who awkwardly sweeps Steven off his feet for a tugboat-set dalliance.It’s enough to break Steven’s writer’s block, that’s for damn sure. The resulting opera is greeted rapturously within the film, but it’s also the tale of a murderous cannibal addicted to romance who also lives on a tugboat. Anyway, it puts him back on top. Everything else? Not so great. Tereza and Julian find themselves in legal trouble, Patricia’s love for cleaning sends her looking for the purity of God, and the real Katrina goes full cuckoo-bananas. Love is madness. Love makes people mad.Miller grounds some of her kookier details in the trappings of a typical NYC romance: sunlit streets, dreamy brownstones, interconnected tales, hammy declarations of devotion, miscommunications, and (of course) trips to the opera. The surroundings are familiar, but Miller wants to use these tropes to interrogate what romance actually means, the true value of love, and how following your bliss might land you in the nuthouse.It’s funny and strange and sometimes truly dark. Not all of it works or even coheres, but it also offers a fresh look at what love does to people, both on the big screen and out in the world. No one makes films quite like Miller; we just wish she would come to our screens more often.“She Came to Me” premiered at the 2023 Berlin International Film Festival.",

        "title": "Anya Taylor-Joy’s Roles to Date — and What She’s Doing Next",
        "content": "Charisma, star talent, and a notably humble personality: At just 26 years old, Anya Taylor-Joy seems to have it all. “The Queen’s Gambit” starlet has become the face of Viktor & Rolf, garnered an Emmy nomination, and won a Golden Globe award — all in just six short years after her first feature role. The Miami-born, Argentine-raised, and London-based international film star landed on the scene in 2015 with Robert Eggers’ directorial debut “The Witch.” The breakout role from the Sundance hit cemented Taylor-Joy’s striking screen presence, with IndieWire’s review calling her “standout” performance “exquisitely ominous and unequivocally haunting.”Taylor-Joy quickly became an indie darling with subsequent films “Morgan” opposite Kate Mara, “Thoroughbreds” by writer-director Cory Finley, and M. Night Shyamalan’s “Split” and “Glass.” In an interview with IndieWire, she lamented that she refuses to be typecast, but rather follows the “magic feeling” of reading the right part.“In Hollywood, people always want you to have a thing,” Taylor-Joy said in 2018. “People give you a thing, whether you want it or not. I followed the roles that I love and the story that I love. I never make the decision of, ‘I’m pretty good at horror, so I’m going to keep doing this right now.’ It’s more just like my characters just happen to inhabit very dark worlds.”As Taylor-Joy continues her takeover of contemporary cinema with recent films like “Amsterdam,” “The Northman,” and “The Menu,” it’s clear she’s an A-lister on the rise.Learn more about Taylor-Joy’s rise to stardom below, and relive her best roles ahead of her upcoming releases.Robert Eggers‘ Sundance smash “The Witch” centered on an exiled Puritan family grappling with the temptation of evil, as embodied by the eldest daughter Thomasin, played by Taylor-Joy. Set in 17th century New England, “The Witch” still haunts Taylor-Joy to this day. During Variety’s “Actors on Actors” series, Taylor-Joy called wrapping “The Witch” her “first heartbreak.”  “The loss of there was a world that existed with a group of people that became my everything for a period of time, and now it’s over,” Taylor-Joy looked back. “I had no concept as to how to deal with that.” Taylor-Joy previously shared that she thought she would never work again after first watching “The Witch” in theaters. “I thought I’d never work again, I still get shivers thinking about it,” Taylor-Joy said during an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. It was just the worst feeling of, ‘I have let down the people I love most in the world. I didn’t do it right.’ And I’m quite verbose, I like to talk, I like to communicate. I did not talk, I just cried. I couldn’t handle seeing my face that large.”  Sci-fi drama “Morgan” placed Taylor-Joy in the foreground once again as a mysterious artificial intelligence project gone wrong. Kate Mara costars as the corporate risk management expert tasked with containing Morgan in the 2016 drama, directed by Ridley Scott’s son, Luke Scott.  Critic Kate Erbland concluded that “Morgan” is “just another sci-fi film that’s only engineered to disappoint” in her review, but the flick marked Taylor-Joy’s memorable foray into high concept endeavors. In an interview with Bustle, Taylor-Joy described portraying the genderless A.I. as liberating. “I never thought about Morgan’s gender because Morgan doesn’t think about her gender,” Taylor-Joy said. We live in a world where people place a lot on gender and dictate what you can and cannot do on that basis, and I just think that’s absolutely ridiculous.”  Taylor-Joy added, “One of my favorite expressions is: Any feeling that you’re having right now is a beautiful example of your human experience. That includes feeling like utter shit, to be honest. If you don’t have the lows, you can’t really have the highs and the highs are so good.” The 2016 Barack Obama biopic “Barry” premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival to mixed reviews. Set in New York City in 1981, 20-year-old Barry (Devon Terrell) transfers to Columbia University for his junior year of college, and suffers a slew of microaggressions and racist remarks. Barry begins dating Charlotte (Taylor-Joy) and their mixed-race relationship draws unwanted attention from classmates.IndieWire’s David Ehlrich likened ”Barry” to “Shakespeare in Love” in his review, while praising Taylor-Joy’s performance as “so vivid and feeling that you’d never assume her character is a composite of Obama’s college paramours.” In fact, it was the character of Charlotte that asked Barry, “Do you not believe in change?” as a nod to Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.  Ehrlich continued, “Here is an urgent testimony to the power of pluralism, a movie that uses the story of a bi-racial man to argue that being American means not having to pick a side, means not having to be white or black at the expense of being anything else. And yet, in failing to be both a biopic and an examination of America’s dividing lines, “Barry” never manages to be the change it wishes to see in the world.”  M. Night Shyamalan‘s hit “Split” gave Taylor-Joy a vehicle to display her softer side — and also play a normal high schooler…that is, until she is kidnapped by Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy) and his 23 different personalities, including the bloodthirsty Beast. Taylor-Joy’s Casey empathized with Kevin’s traumatic upbringing, and audiences are invited to analyze Casey’s scars both past and present.IndieWire critic Jette Kernion wrote in her review of the film that “the movie relies too heavily on close-ups of Casey’s face in lieu of a strong script,” comparing Taylor-Joy’s tragically minute facial expressions with McAvoy’s extreme “transformations” as various personalities.Taylor-Joy said in an interview with Harper’s Bazaar that she struggled when she first learned of Casey’s sexual abuse in the script. “At the end of the read-through, I actually couldn’t cope,” she opened up. “We had to go to rehearsals straight after lunch [and] I just locked myself in a room and cried. I cried for a really long time because my characters are very real for me and I love them like family. Obviously everyone’s pain is utterly unique, and the only way that I could access her pain was through empathy. I couldn’t pretend that I knew how that felt. I hope I did a good job of representing it. Everyone deals with trauma differently, and she just shuts down.”Based on the play by Cory Finley of the same name, “Thoroughbreds” explores the juxtaposition between sociopathy and empathy with two affluent troubled teens with a taste for murder, played by Olivia Cooke and Taylor-Joy. Anton Yelchin costars as a washed-up drug dealer in one of the actor’s last performances before his tragic death. The murder-for-hire plot was a breakout hit at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, leading to Focus Features purchasing “Thoroughbreds” for $5 million in one of the festival’s first deals.  Taylor-Joy raved about first-time writer-director Finley at the London premiere, saying, “I never worry if a director is going to be competent, because for me it’s more about a deep emotional connection. I just vibe with people of a certain tribe, and with Cory I felt like I had just met a soulmate.”And Taylor-Joy’s character haunted her maybe even more so than her “The Witch” triumph: “It was only when the film ended and I shed her skin that I had the clarity to see she’s quite a toxic person,” Taylor-Joy reflected. “And while she’s a symptom of her environment, it was strange to inhabit her for such a long time, because at a certain point you’re just justifying her actions.” Taylor-Joy was immediately drawn to the role of Petronella “Nella” Brandt in PBS’ “The Miniaturist,” a three-part miniseries based on the novel by Jessie Burton. Nella is a 17th century Dutch bride who struggles to adapt to married life with her new husband Johannes’ (Alex Hassle) and his strict Amsterdam household. Nella quickly finds herself dodging family politics and nosy servants. “I think she’s very naïve at the beginning,” Taylor-Joy exclusively told IndieWire. “She’s been told that she must be docile by society. She’s been told what’s expected of her for her entire life, so I don’t think she’s had any thoughts outside of that.”  Taylor-Joy added, “Because she finds herself in an unfamiliar situation, she actually becomes incredibly resilient.” Although the role was “frustrating” for Taylor-Joy at times, it was an “interesting exercise” in constricting her emotions — and waist. “We had a couple of emotional scenes in ‘The Miniaturist’ where the director would just be like, ‘You need to tone it down because your level of where you are is not the level where this character should be,’” Taylor-Joy remembered. ”I was like, ‘Wow, that’s the first time anyone has ever asked me to tone it down before.’ [Also] I’d never worn a corset before…I still have scars on either side of my body.”  The sinister sibling drama centers on four kids seeking refuge in a seemingly-haunted seaside home. “The Orphanage” screenwriter Sergio G. Sánchez made his directorial debut with the horror thriller, costarring Charlie Heaton (“Stranger Things”), George MacKay (“Captain Fantastic”), and Mia Goth (“A Cure for Wellness”). “Marrowbone” presented a new type of character for Taylor-Joy to play: one who “has her shit together,” the actress joked to Rue Morgue in 2018. “Allie is unlike any character I’ve ever played before,” Taylor-Joy clarified. Allie’s just a beautiful role; she and Jack [MacKay] have this great love. His journey is so intense and dramatic, and Allie is kind of the rock who stands by him and loves him.”  In fact, some of that “great love” spewed over behind-the-scenes. “The four of us — Mia, Charlie, George and I — became so close that we really were like a family,” Taylor-Joy concluded. “And to portray that kind of great love on screen — I was amazed at the power of it. I’ve never done anything like that.” Taylor-Joy reprised her role as the Beast’s (James McAvoy) handler and Kevin Wendell Crumb’s love interest in M. Night Shyamalan’s “Split” follow-up, “Glass.” When the 2019 film flopped with critics, writer-director Shyamalan admitted to feeling “distraught” over its 37% Rotten Tomatoes score. Honestly, I was feeling like, ‘Will they never let me be different without throwing me on the garbage pile?’” Shyamalan told the NYU’s Stern School of Business, where he delivered the 2019 Ashok C. Sani Distinguished Scholar-in-Residence lecture April 16, 2019. “The feeling of worthlessness rushed me, and to be honest, it doesn’t ever really leave. But anyway, the film went on, right? It became number one in every country in the world, and it represents my beliefs.” IndieWire critic David Ehrlich slammed the film for being the “biggest disappointment” in Shyamalan’s career, following the success of “Split.”  “This was supposed to be Shyamalan’s greatest triumph — the coup de grâce of the long comeback saga that he’s been living for most of the 21st century,” Ehrlich wrote. “Instead, this lugubrious slog only sharpens the feeling that he’s too raw and reactionary for his own good — that he’s grown too invested in his own story to tell any others with the patience, discipline, and power that defined his first hits.”  Taylor-Joy joined hit BBC One crime drama “Peaky Blinders” in season five. The Steven Knight-created series moved into 20th century England during its fifth season following Tommy Shelby (Cillian Murphy). Taylor-Joy appeared in six episodes as Gina Gray, the wife of series antagonist Michael Gray (Finn Cole). “I could not possibly be more excited to be joining such a talented group of people,” Taylor-Joy announced to Deadline. “I can’t wait to get in and play this character.”  She later told The Hollywood Reporter that it was a “pleasure to get to play the most hated character” on the series.  To NME, Taylor-Joy gave insight into her work ethic after non-stop releases since 2015. “I feel very, very lucky that I’ve never taken a job because I was scared of not having another job,” she revealed. “It just so happens that these characters come up. There’s definitely moments that I’m like ‘Oh no, I really need a break but I can’t handle someone else playing her.’” Taylor-Joy’s TV venture only added to breaking the “box” that audiences were trying to categorize her talent in as an “indie scream queen,” among other labels. “I’m very grateful to directors who have seen outside of that,” Taylor-Joy summed up. “If I keep doing all of these different roles, hopefully people will understand that we’re actors and it’s our job to be chameleons.” Taylor-Joy returned to her beloved period pieces, albeit with a modern twist in this fresh take on Jane Austen’s beloved heroine “Emma.” Partnered with another first-time filmmaker, Autumn de Wilde, Taylor-Joy blossomed in the title role of matchmaker Emma Woodhouse in the Focus Features release. IndieWire’s review of the lush 2020 film applauded Taylor-Joy’s depth, acknowledging her acting choice to “play to the character’s ennui; Emma’s boredom is on the verge of becoming an existential crisis.”  The lead star also put her own spin on Emma, telling IndieWire’s Anne Thompson that she wanted to stay as true to the novel as possible. “I wanted permission to make her mean,” she explained. “I just want to tell the story the way Austen wrote it. There’s this emphasis on being likable. You have to like the character. No you don’t, not all the time. It’s not interesting that way.” Taylor-Joy confessed, “It’s something truthful, fresh, and fun, fun to watch her behave badly… I had my version. We’re all hot messes. It’s the real truth of how these people felt. They couldn’t be perfect all the time because they are human beings.” After multiple delays and reshoots, “The New Mutants” landed in theaters and VOD in 2020. Taylor-Joy starred opposite Maisie Williams, Henry Zaga, Blu Hunt, and Charlie Heaton “as five young mutants who are being imprisoned against their will and just discovering their powers.” IndieWire declined to review the film after Disney did not offer screening links or socially-distanced press screenings to film critics amidst the coronavirus pandemic.  Directed by Josh Boone, “The New Mutants” is the last Fox-produced superhero movie released under Disney. Audiences were given a sneak peek at the film’s opening scene during the Comic-Con@Home panel in July 2020 prior to eventually premiering in theaters a month later. The Marvel spin-off also opened at the top of the Apple TV and FandangoNow charts, 90 days after its theatrical release.  In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Taylor-Joy thanked fans for remaining excited about the film even after three years of pushed-back premiere dates. “I have to give massive props to the fans, because they’ve really stuck out this film with us,” she stated. “They’ve been waiting for a long time, and they’re still enthusiastic about it. So it really speaks to the dedication of the fandom.” Breakout Netflix series “The Queen’s Gambit” was the go-to quarantine binge in 2020, and made Taylor-Joy a household name. Co-created, written, and directed by “Godless” showrunner Scott Frank, “The Queen’s Gambit” follows fictional Kentucky-born chess champion Beth Harmon (Taylor-Joy) as she grapples with her fame, success, and narcotics dependency. The limited series landed Taylor-Joy her first Golden Globe Award, SAG win, and recognition at the Critics’ Choice Awards.  In our review, critic Ben Travers praised Taylor-Joy’s assurance as Beth. “Taylor-Joy trusts the character, the context, and her own command to keep viewers enamored, and it works beautifully,” Travers penned. “Being so focused on the here and now helps keep audiences there with her, as many unspoken moments — especially during chess matches — only connect because of her richly detailed process.” “The Queen’s Gambit” broke Netflix limited series streaming records, attracting 62 million viewers in four weeks before going on to earn Taylor-Joy a Golden Globe, a Critics Choice Award, and a SAG Award.  Writer-director Edgar Wright dove into psychological thriller territory with “Last Night in Soho,” starring Taylor-Joy as an idealized doppelgänger of main character Eloise (Thomasin McKenzie). The 1960s-set film transformed London into a neon-hued erotic nightmare, and as Taylor-Joy told MTV’s “Happy Sad Confused” podcast in February 2020, even watching scenes played back led her to be “disturbed” by the “claustrophobic” world Wright built.  “The colors are so intense,” Taylor-Joy said. “It’s a really well-directed acid trip. I think people will really like it. You definitely will not be bored.” Taylor-Joy said of working with Wright, “The man loves cinema. He loves any art form. It’s so fun to talk music with him. He just knows everything. I don’t know how he fits it all in his head. I loved it.”  Taylor-Joy reunited with “The Witch” director Eggers for his third film, Viking revenge drama “The Northman.” Alexander Skarsgård, Nicole Kidman, Willem Dafoe, Ethan Hawke, and Björk co-starred in the epic tale of a Nordic prince (Skarsgård) who seeks to avenge his father’s death. Taylor-Joy told Collider she was “over the moon” to collaborate with Eggers again. “Robert and I have now been friends longer than we have been co-workers,” Taylor-Joy said. “Getting the opportunity to create art together again is amazing. We have both grown so much apart and now we get to grow back together. I am so proud to be a part of this project. Every moment on set I am proud. I think we will be presenting to the world something it genuinely hasn’t seen before. I just feel so humbled I get to be a part of it.”Taylor-Joy also made headlines once more after being cast in David O. Russell’s star-studded “Amsterdam.” Margot Robbie, Robert De Niro, Chris Rock, Rami Malek, Zoe Saldana, Christian Bale, Michael Shannon, John David Washington, and more A-list actors rounded out the dream cast.Produced by Adam McKay, “The Menu” stars Anya Taylor-Joy and Nicholas Hoult as Margot and Tyler, a wealthy young couple who feast on surprising delicacies curated by a famed chef, played by Ralph Fiennes, on a remote island. Yet not everything is as it seems…“Succession” director and executive producer Mark Mylod helmed the Searchlight Pictures film. Taylor-Joy told IndieWire that the satire was a “smorgasbord” of genres. She earned a Critics Choice Award nomination for her performance.Taylor-Joy voices Princess Peach in the animated feature film “Super Mario Bros.” based on the Nintendo characters. Chris Pratt and Charlie Day as plumber brothers Mario and Luigi, who set out to save Princess Peach (Taylor-Joy) as Bowser (Jack Black) and Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen) stand in their way. Keegan-Michael Key voices Toad.Taylor-Joy revealed that since being cast in the voiceover role, she has become “a gamer.” “Ideally, I like playing at arcades, because, again, it’s like cinema; I love the ceremony,” the actres said. “I’ll go with a whole bunch of friends. And we’ll just spend hours at the arcade.” This prequel to “Mad Max: Fury Road” focuses on the origin story of Furiosa, previously played by Charlize Theron. George Miller’s “Furiosa” now places Taylor-Joy in the role of the apocalyptic vigilante, also starring Chris Hemsworth and “Watchmen” actor Yahya Abdul-Mateen II.Taylor-Joy told IndieWire that “Furiosa” is the “dirtiest, bloodiest I have ever been,” adding, “Any time I get to be dirty or bloody and not perfectly prim and pretty, I’m just having a ball, that’s where I feel most comfortable. So yeah, ‘Furiosa’ was definitely right up my street.”For all the details on “Furiosa,” click here.Talyor-Joy is joined by Miles Teller in Scott Derrickson’s “The Gorge” about two very dangerous young people who, despite the corrupt and lethal world they operate in, finding a soulmate in each other. Written by Zach Dean (“The Tomorrow War”), the thriller marks “The Black Phone” helmer Derrickson’s 11th feature behind horror movies like “Sinister” and “The Exorcism of Emily Rose.” The award-winning actress teams up with “The Queen’s Gambit” showrunner Scott Frank for an upcoming adaptation of “Lolita” author Vladimir Nabokov’s 1932 novel “Laughter in the Dark.” Taylor-Joy is slated to play Margot Peters, a 17-year-old aspiring actress who captures the eye of middle-aged art critic Albert Albinus.According to an interview with The Ringer’s The Watch podcast, Frank called the project “a valentine to movies, I’m going to do it as a film noir and a movie within a movie. And it’s a really nasty, wonderful, thriller.”And it’s clear that whatever Taylor-Joy puts her mind to next, the project will be personal to her. “At the beginning, I used to say like, ‘I know this sounds crazy, but my characters are real to me,’” Taylor-Joy said in an interview with IndieWire. “I care about these characters and the relationships that I have with them are as real as the relationships that I have with people that I don’t play,” she explained.We can’t wait to see what other characters Taylor-Joy bonds with next.",

        "title": "‘Invisible Beauty’ Review: Lively Documentary Honors Bethann Hardison, Mother of Black Fashion",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival. Magnolia Pictures releases the film in NYC theaters on Friday, September 15 with expansion to follow on Friday, September 22.Progress in the face of systemic injustice does not occur naturally, it is urged along by sheer force of will — often by one radical visionary. In the case of the fashion industry’s racism, that person is Bethann Hardison. A trailblazing model in the 1970s, she became one of the most important agents of the ’90s, discovering the first male supermodel Tyson Beckford and mentoring Naomi Campbell and Iman. When fickle trends threatened to erase all of her hard work in the aughts, she boldly called out the industry’s blatantly racist casting practices, causing a seismic shift once and for all.Hardison’s remarkable and fabulous life serves as an inspiring lesson in affecting radical change from within the system, and her methods can be studied thanks to the riveting new documentary “Invisible Beauty.”Hardison serves as co-writer and director alongside prolific fashion documentarian Frédéric Tcheng, (“Halston,” “Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel”). Their presentation is fairly conventional, but there’s so much information to deliver that a straightforward approach feels apt. While it may seem unusual for a documentary subject to profile herself, the mere fact of the collaboration hints at the unstoppable force of nature in its sights.Besides, Hardison isn’t the kind of established figure who begs a totally subjective portrayal (if such a thing even exists); she’s an unsung hero of the industry who deserves her overdue flowers. As a director, she doesn’t gloss over the more painful aspects of her personal life, such as her somewhat strained relationship with her son, “A Different World” star Kadeem Hardison.The film opens with a parade of influential figures singing Hardison’s praises: Tracee Ellis Ross, Zendaya, Whoopi Goldberg, and Fran Liebowitz all pop up briefly, though more comprehensive analysis is provided by Iman, Campbell, Beckford, and a host of fashion players. Tcheng shot part of the film himself in intimate visits to Hardison’s upstate abode, and the filmmakers are shown discussing how to present the wealth of material. “It all starts in Bedford Stuyvesant,” says Hardison, before rolling on peppy archival footage from the iconic Brooklyn neighborhood in the 1950s and ’60s.Though her years with him were marked by strictness, Hardison’s father was an Imam who mentored Malcolm X, and she credits him with radicalizing her. After attending FIT and NYU, she began working as a saleswoman in the garment district, where she caught the eye of emerging Black designer Willi Smith. Beginning as a fit model, her androgynous look and expressive personality earned her spots on the runways of the ’70s, which she walked alongside Beverly Johnson, Iman, and Pat Cleveland.Though they were all the rage in New York, Hardison and her contemporaries sometimes felt hostility from European and Southern buyers. Crafting her signature defiant walk as a protective shield, she cites Kurosawa films as early influences: “I’d always think of Samurai when I would walk.”Galvanized by fashion’s abysmal race politics, Hardison turned to booking and representation to have a wider reach on the industry. She launched the Bethann Management Agency in 1984, and co-founded The Black Girls Coalition with Iman in 1988, both with the aim of supporting African American models. Her agency was known for discovering the most interesting and dynamic models from various backgrounds, including Kimora Lee Simmons, Roshumba, Veronica Webb, and Beckford. Countless interviews with industry insiders emphasize Hardison’s revolutionary impact on the fashion industry in the ’90s.After Hardison retired to Mexico to plot her next move, however, the industry took a demoralizing backslide into white homogeneity. Led by Prada and Calvin Klein, the prevalence of unknown Eastern European models led to the “heroin chic” look of the early aughts. In 2007, she organized a bombshell press conference calling out the blatant racism that had become industry standard, with casting calls often stipulating, “No blacks, no ethnics.” She followed that up with what became known as “The Shame List,” an accounting of the high profile designers that were guilty of using little to Black models in their runway shows.The film shares this information at a brisk enough clip, and the runway shows and press conference footage have an air of cultural artifact being defined and preserved in real time. For anyone who wasn’t paying close attention to fashion at the time, it’s an illuminating record of what was going on behind the scenes, and an important reminder of how much media is shaped by the fashion industry. It’s easy enough to draw parallels to the battles for representation playing out in Hollywood, even if the film doesn’t explicitly draw those parallels. It’s a vital reminder of how much the images we ingest, whether intentionally or not, shape our worldview. That’s something Hardison understands all too well.“My objective was always to change the world, it wasn’t just to change fashion,” Hardison says in the film. “That was just the tool I had.” In her later years, Hardison is enjoying the kind of resurgence befitting her stature. She is still being dressed by fabulous designers, photographed in beautiful clothes, and consulted by fashion’s elite. “Mother is living her best life,” Iman and Campbell joke to each other. For now, she seems content to work on her memoir, and share her story on film. “This moment everyone thinks I’m having,” she muses. “I think being alive is the moment.” Amen.“Invisible Beauty” premiered at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival.

        "title": "‘Kokomo City’ Review: Trans Sex Workers Radiate Their Truth in Transcendent Debut",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival. Magnolia Pictures releases the film in theaters on Friday, July 28.D. Smith knows how to make a person stand up and pay attention. From the rollicking opening scene of “Kokomo City” — her luminous documentary portrait of four Black trans sex workers which she shot, edited, and directed — it’s clear the terms are being set by a visionary artist who just happened to funnel her interdisciplinary talents into filmmaking for this particular project. How lucky we are that she found this medium.“Kokomo City” may be her filmmaking debut, but this songwriter innately understands the rhythms and beats that make compelling cinematic storytelling. You can see it in the staccato contrast of light and dark in her elegant black-and-white photography. You can hear it in the unexpected needle drops and deep-cut tracks, and you can feel it in her lyrical cuts that find small moments of beauty in everyday compositions. Make no mistake, Smith announces wordlessly from behind the camera: I have arrived to change the game.It would be hard to conjure a better song for a film about sex workers than Randy Crawford’s “Street Life,” which heralds the beginning of “Kokomo City” as the title credits pop in bubbly yellow graphics. But Smith, a two-time Grammy-nominated songwriter and producer, draws on a deep well of musical knowledge to score her film with as much artistry as she gives its cinematography. Many of the tracks are Smith originals, often with her collaborator and producer Stacy Barthe, like the timeless-sounding “Sugar Daddy,” but she makes equal use of lesser-known blues and funk cuts, like the film’s incredible namesake song “Sissy Man Blues” by Kokomo Arnold.Smith’s music and photography instincts carry the film cinematically, but the real stars of “Kokomo City” are its honest and dynamic subjects. In intimate interviews, Smith often places herself on the ground so the speakers hover above the camera like queens. They speak to her like friends (and maybe they are, so what?), but the familiarity of shared identity and experience creates a riveting shorthand that forces the viewer to keep up — if they want to get the jokes.Take, for instance, the film’s wild opening anecdote from a young woman named Liyah, who lives and works in Decatur, Georgia. In a story with so many turns it could serve as inspiration for another “Zola,” Liyah explains how she once grabbed a client’s gun and tried to shoot him only to find it wasn’t loaded, tumbled down the stairs in a knockdown struggle, then rescheduled the date for the next night after a friendly explanation cleared everything up. Smith scores the scene like a farce, then a drama, then a thriller, before coming back around to farce, punctuating it with the celebratory thrum of “Street Life.” All in a day’s work.The women wax poetic on the issues most pressing to them; the pros and cons of passing or living stealth, the hypocrisy of guys who only see them on the down low, and the way they are treated and viewed by cis Black women. Unhindered by the pressure to perform a specific image of Black trans women, they are able to fully be seen and heard as themselves. The film shows these women engaging in the kinds of conversations that usually only occur behind closed doors — certainly not in a mainstream media that demands respectability with its visibility.There are other vital voices in the film, as well, like a few “trans-attracted” men who agreed to appear in the film. Smith interviews one energetic duo in their car who loudly encourage their less confident brothers: “If you like them, go hard for them…don’t live a double life.” She cuts this passionate sermon with lilting footage of a male ballet dancer, both powerful and graceful in his beauty: The dance of masculinity. Another interview shows a happy couple, a man secure enough in his sexuality to live out loud with the woman he loves. Smith captures him handling her with tenderness and hunger, as gentle curls of smoke pass between their lips.Smith’s subjects are also free from the pressure to paint everything in rosy hues. “I’m supposed to tell people this shit is cool? This shit is safe? This is survival work. This is risky shit,” says a young woman named Daniella. Her powerful diatribe feels like a wake-up call to the many ways these women have been isolated from their communities. Smith films her in the bath, her expressive face growing ever more defiant against the glistening white tub. There she sits, alone, with no one to witness her unjust pain and righteous brilliance. No one except the camera and, perhaps now, a more empathetic world.“Kokomo City” premiered at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival. It was acquired by Magnolia Pictures. ",

        "title": "‘Landscape with Invisible Hand’ Review: Aliens Disrupt the Economy in a Dull Satire of Life Under Capitalism",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival. MGM releases the film in select theaters on Friday, August 18.Cory Finley’s extremely welcome mission to make every conceivable kind of high school movie — at a time when few other serious filmmakers are bothering to make any kind of high school movie — continues with the young director’s third feature and first misstep. Like “Thoroughbreds” and “Bad Education” before it, “Landscape with Invisible Hand” leverages the ecology of American teenagedom into a satirical and/or breathtakingly sad class comedy that explores the value of empathy in capitalism. Unlike either of those two films, it’s full of slimy little aliens who look like a frozen supermarket turkey made out of tongue.They’re called the Vuvv (rhymes with “love,” not “Clicquot”), and by the time this story begins in 2036, these squat pink colonizers have been holding Earth’s economy hostage for more than five years. They didn’t take over the planet by blowing up the White House or terrorizing major cities with Tripods, they simply disrupted the tech sector with enough out-of-this-world gadgetry until the human race was forced to buy into the Vuvv’s cold vision of the future or preserve their remaining dignity below the poverty line.“This is a great time for entrepreneurs!” says one of the Bret Baier-looking bootlickers who anchors the Vuvv equivalent of Fox News. If his nauseating catchphrase proves typical of an airless film in which the satire is often too blunt to be funny and the drama too contrived to be poignant, it also tees up the film’s increasingly compassionate interest in probing the human species’ hierarchy of needs. Food and shelter come first, but not everybody wants to be an entrepreneur — not everybody wants to abandon the analog joys of being alive just because they might get to share a small piece of the profits.Budding young artist Adam Campbell (Asante Blackk) was raised by a currently absent father who chose the latter, and our downtrodden but still defiant hero would love to carry on that legacy if he can afford it. But he can’t. His mom (Tiffany Haddish) has been unemployed forever, she can’t pay the electricity bill on the family’s crumbling New England home, and shit is getting super depressing at school; borrowing its title from M.T. Anderson’s novel of the same name, and also one of the many paintings that Finley uses to succinctly establish the film’s timeline and backstory, “Landscape with Invisible Hand” opens with Adam’s homeroom teacher shooting himself in the head after the entire profession is rendered obsolete by Vuvv tech.In this case, that tech is the refrigerator magnet-like node humans wear on their foreheads to receive telepathic signals — and Vuvv history lessons — from their extra-terrestrial overlords. But the nodes can also beam signals back, which Adam and his opportunistic new girlfriend Chloe (Kylie Rogers) take advantage of when they start broadcasting their courtship to a well-paying audience of aliens fascinated by human love.An extra twist: Adam has invited Chloe, her sullen older brother (Michael Gandolfini), and their dad (Josh Hamilton) to move out of their car and into his mother’s basement. He’s nice like that, and his new boarders seem nice enough, too, but Adam is too young to appreciate how desperation can breed a conditional kindness. While being VuvvTube creators allows the couple to enjoy a taste of the self-determination that wealthier humans used to enjoy, it soon becomes apparent that Chloe is less interested in love than money, which isn’t just a problem for Adam but also for the Vuers back home — these aliens get off on authenticity, and they’ll sue anyone who tries to fake it for the cameras. And they start with Adam and Chloe.“Landscape with Invisible Hand” hinges on the fact that humans are a remarkably adaptable species at the same time as it keys into the things that we can’t live without. Despite the film’s pointed lack of violence, there’s something both righteous and a little disquieting about how unafraid its characters have become of the unfeeling but hyper-advanced alien race who could theoretically vaporize the entire planet at the push of a button.The Vuvv themselves are designed for absurdity more than fear (they look like something Kurt Vonnegut might sketch on a restaurant napkin), but there’s a brusque violence to the language they scratch out by rubbing together the Brillo pads at the end of their squiddy tentacle arms — enough so that the second half of the story, in which a Vuvv moves in with Adam’s mom and cosplays as the “man” of the house, is stifled by a too-thick layer of tension. While Haddish’s casting serves as a helpful reminder that this is supposed to be funnier than frightening, the helplessness baked into this sci-fi tale of economic surrender gradually builds into a moribund sense of dread that stifles most of its laughs.“Landscape with Invisible Hand” calls for a bit less showmanship than either of Finley’s previous efforts, which relied on a remarkable degree of control to mesh contradictory tones into more than the sum of their parts, but the writer-director doesn’t hit upon anything that might offset his missing virtuosity. Here, Finley often seems to be at the mercy of his material’s strangeness. He stages most scenes with a vacuum-sealed flatness, as if unsure how else to focus our attention on what’s sucking the life out of the film’s world, and his cast — who can only stretch their characters’ shared frustration so far — are left with little to do but lean into the anti-drama of intergalactic domination.Hamilton is the only one who gets to have any fun by pushing back, as the “Eighth Grade” actor subverts his gently paternal screen image by playing Chloe’s dad as the ultimate Elon Musk reply guy, willing to do or wear whatever it takes to be recognized by his new business gods. His character sucks up to the Vuvv with remarkable speed and silliness the millisecond he’s given a chance, his sitcom self-abasement suggesting that “Landscape with Invisible Hand” might have cut deeper as a story about someone resigning themselves to heartless capitalism than as a story about someone looking for a way to resist it on their own time. That’s a story Finley has told before and one that I look forward to watching him tell again in some other form. But it’s hard to buy the socioeconomic power of Adam’s artistic self-becoming in a movie whose director can’t stop the Vuvv from snuffing out what makes his own work special.“Landscape with Invisible Hand” premiered at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival. MGM will release it in theaters later this year.",

        "title": "‘Mami Wata’ Review: Cinematography Is the Star in Mesmerizing West African Folk Tale",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival. Dekanalog releases the film in select theaters on Friday, September 29.Mami Wata is a multifaceted figure whose personae is as diverse as the diaspora that venerates her. A patroness of beauty, money, and all things that ebb and flow, she’s sometimes depicted as being half-woman, half-fish. At other times, she’s shown with a gigantic serpent wrapped around her shoulders. She’s a relatively new deity who arose between the 15th and 20th centuries, a period when Africa became heavily involved in global trade. Her name comes from pidgin English, the language of commerce, and translates as “Mother Water.” She’s a water spirit, ruling over the seas that separated captive Africans from their homes and brought foreign people and influences to African shores, and she can be as benevolent or as cruel as the ocean itself.The Nigerian film “Mami Wata,” which bills itself as “a West Afrikan folklore,” engages with the spirit in a number of ways. The story takes place in an isolated village called Iyi where, as a title card informs us at the beginning of the movie, “fewer assumptions exist” about Mami Wata than in other places. Her reputation as a “capitalist deity” is key to the plot of the film, which takes place during a period of change as tumultuous as the one that gave rise to Mami Wata herself. But that’s later on. First, the water.Cinematographer Lílis Soares and writer-director C.J. “Fiery” Obasi craft a breathtaking array of compositions, textures, and tones using water and beaches in “Mami Wata.” In one shot, the ocean looks like textured stained glass. In another, drops of water glisten off of a man’s forehead like a constellation of tiny stars. A seashore at night evokes a completely different mood than that same location under the noonday sun, and Obasi can change the tone of a scene by tilting the camera so the horizon cuts across a different part of the frame. The man-made world retains a patina of magic in “Mami Wata” as well, as Obasi uses strong directional lighting to create artificial horizons on walls and across his actors’ faces. Even better, all of this is done in expressionistic black and white.Similar care is put into the film’s majestic sculptural hairstyles, stylized makeups, and creative costuming. (The latter makes use of fabrics printed with bold, repeating geometric patterns, which Obasi incorporates into his compositions in eye-catching ways.) Costume designer Bunmi Demiola Fashina, key makeup artist Campbell Precious Arebamen, and key hair stylist Adefunke Olowu receive their own title cards in the end credits alongside the film’s stars and above-the-line crew — a spotlight that doesn’t always shine on hair and makeup artists in particular, but is well deserved here.The story is a symbolically loaded tale of feminine authority under assault by masculine rapaciousness, centered on a powerful priestess named Mama Efe (Rita Edochie) and her two daughters, Zinwe (Uzoamaka Aniunoh) and Prisca (Evelyne Ily Juhen). There’s more than a touch of Shakespeare in these characters, who are burdened by their obligations and take the pursuit of power — divine or otherwise — very seriously. The most interesting of the bunch is Prisca, who is not Mama Efe’s biological daughter but is the more dutiful protegé nonetheless. (Juhen is also the most compelling performer in the film, exuding an effortless sensuality that ties her character to the goddess that her family serves.) Zinwe is supposed to take over once her mother can no longer serve as an intermediary between Mami Wata and the people of Ily. But she’s been away, and is no longer in tune with what the village needs.Their regime may not last long enough to have a succession crisis, anyway. A young boy recently died of a virus in Ily despite Mama Efe’s healing intervention, and her assurances that this is the will of Mami Wata are no longer enough to pacify the villagers. They want amenities like electricity and hospitals (it’s not clear when “Mami Wata” is set, but the presence of these things implies that it’s close enough to our present), and their patience with Mama Efe’s cautious approach to modernization is running out. Enter Jasper (Emeka Amakeze), a defector from a nearby rebel army who drifts into Ily and sees an opportunity to take power for himself.The resulting conflict pits matriarchy against patriarchy and traditional against modern, with Prisca and Zinwe caught in the middle. At times, the drama in “Mami Wata” can be stiff, as can the action choreography. But given that it’s a revenge fantasy that revolves around a Shakespearean power struggle, a little formality doesn’t hurt the movie all that much. (More confusing is a late-in-the-game reveal that throws a hand grenade into the film’s already volatile gender politics.) Without giving away too much, by the time Prisca fully embraces her destiny, any nods to naturalism would be wholly out of place as “Mami Wata” ascends to the status of myth.“Mami Wata” is a historical first for Sundance. It’s the first homegrown Nigerian film to debut at the festival, the culmination of a five-year process that’s taken Obasi and his wife/producer Oge Obasi to workshops and labs around Africa and Europe, including a slot at Final Cut in Venice in 2021. The extra time spent developing the film pays off on screen: From its opening title design to the last notes of Tunde Jegede’s score, “Mami Wata” is a work of art.“Mami Wata” premiered at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival.",

        "title": "‘Stephen Curry: Underrated’ Review: A Sincere, Slight Look at the NBA Star’s College Years",
        "content": "Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival. A24 and AppleTV+ releases the film in select theaters and streaming on Apple on Friday, July 21.Of all the major American sports, basketball is the one where personality shines through the easiest. There’s no helmet, no facemask. Any one player only has to share the court with nine others. The athleticism, the fire, and the smiles all come through. So one of the biggest challenges for any documentary filmmaker trying to make a biography of a professional basketball player is to contend with what’s already freely given.In the world of the NBA, Stephen Curry isn’t one of the largest personalities, but he’s not a blank slate either. Watch clips from any of his Golden State Warriors’ title runs or his legendary game-winners, and you’ll see a man who isn’t afraid to show emotion when the lights are brightest. He’s lived a life around sports, having come from a family of athletes, including a father and brother who are fellow NBA vets. As the opening minutes of “Stephen Curry: Underrated” show, he now has career records to go with a handful of championship rings. The biggest question for this feature-length Apple and A24 doc isn’t if all of that exists, but why. To find an answer, director Peter Nicks is tasked with going back to Curry’s time as a college undergrad.Though the film sometimes feels like multiple Steph Curry docs merged into one, the thread that becomes the most significant begins with a flashback to the mid-2000s, tracking Curry’s recruitment to Davidson College. Over the course of his three years playing and studying there, he went from undervalued point guard to a topic of national conversation. Naturally, that attention came as a result of his on-court heroics.But the most illuminating parts of “Underrated” from that time are the tiny glimpses in between the games. It’s a more carefree, freewheeling Curry in that footage. (One particular clip from a campus sketch show will be a treat to anyone whose first few years of college featured an inexplicable amount of Asher Roth.) There are grainy digital camera shots of study rooms and hotel hallways, evoking his time there. Those become the thin backdrop for a remembrance of Curry’s Davidson teams and the NCAA tournament appearances that made the small North Carolina liberal arts college a coast-to-coast sensation for a few weeks in 2008.Those glimpses are fun, and “Underrated” is steadily entertaining throughout. At the same time, it’s hard to escape the feeling that this film is struggling to make a compelling case for its own existence. Aside from some sparse input from Curry’s teammates and coaches (including the sage Bob McKillop, for whom the Davidson court is now named), there’s not much in those Wildcat runs that wouldn’t pop up in a well-produced, in-house NCAA special. (You hear far more from Jim Nantz, Gus Johnson, and Sean McDonough’s in-game calls than you do from Steph himself.) There’s a healthy dose of from-the-stands camcorder footage of games throughout Curry’s college tenure. But fun as that perspective is, the story of Curry’s career has already been written.As far as what makes Curry the player he is, “Underrated” nods toward parents Dell and Sonya reworking his shot back in high school. Aside from the other technical elements of his current-day prep (seen all too sparingly in workout sequences), the rest of what “Underrated” offers as the secrets to Curry’s success are more in the realm of self-psychology. The motivating factors for any point in Curry’s career — to achieve greatness, support teammates, and represent his roots — are the kind of one-size-fits-all sentiments that you could graft onto pretty much every pro athlete’s origin story. Save for a few peppered comments about wanting to prove wrong the people who underestimated him for his size, “Underrated” is a spiritual sibling to last year’s ESPN Derek Jeter documentary series “The Captain.” Both are tasked with wringing drama out of someone who’s lived a uniquely charmed sports existence.The closest that Nicks gets to breaking that mold is putting forth Curry as a well-adjusted superstar, one who, despite living in a Bay Area house with a private gym, a bevy of Apple products, and a tastefully upscale interior, takes a workmanlike approach to his performance. On drives to the Chase Center for Warriors games with a camera in the passenger seat, he’s already locked into a silent focus. He approaches his strength-training regimen like a run to the grocery store. Even when his commercial shoot is crashed by a famous fan, he juggles all of those elements as someone who knows that they’re all part of the job. If there’s a heavy dose of added pressure that Curry still carries after his many exploits on the national stage, he doesn’t show it while there are cameras in the room.So searching for something to latch onto, “Underrated” includes Curry’s delayed pursuit of a Davidson degree, after leaving college early for the NBA Draft left him a few credits short. It’s another example of Curry’s life being more compelling in theory than in practice, as Zoom meetings with a professor and Google Doc thesis outlines flit in and out of the film. (Any actual discussion of his chosen topic of women’s sports is limited to a few over-the-shoulder glances of him typing out parts of a rough draft.) Seeing him finish up his school obligations as he and his college teammates talk about their time in the spotlight a decade and a half ago makes for a cute bit of symmetry, but it’s never more than just another ingredient in the soup.For all its familiarity and the lack of surprise that Curry himself is bringing, “Underrated” is still the product of an observant storyteller. When the film gets the breathing room to be spontaneous, particularly in its peeks into the day-to-day practice schedule of an otherworldly three-point shooter, there’s an excitement and a discovery there. That spirit spills over into the contributions of editor JD Marlow, who works together some smile-inducing transitions between past and present. The match cuts between swishes a decade apart or Curry side-stepping defenders for step-back 3s show a greater sense of diligence and playfulness than you usually find in straightforward hagiographies.Maybe it’s because this film’s perception of Curry is of a player too talented and fueled by the joy of the long-range shot to be petty or spiteful. Maybe it’s his later success that keeps his Davidson stint from feeling like the open wound it clearly still is for at least one of his teammates. Whatever the reason, “Underrated” ends up feeling like something better suited for a different medium. The speed run through the end of Curry’s 2021-22 season with the Warriors, in particular, feels like a missed opportunity, a lack of runway, or a film butting up against its own self-appointed purpose. Closer to a magazine piece than a doc — it’s probably not a coincidence this will arrive somewhere near the 15th anniversary of that ’08 Davidson team’s Cinderella tournament run — it also has the feeling of a write-around profile that managed to get some time with its main subject after all. Curry has had a fascinating past two decades, something that “Underrated” does an effective job of capturing. But in harnessing what was always there in full view, there’s not much else here to add.“Stephen Curry: Underrated” premiered at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival. The film will be available on Apple TV+ later this year. ",
